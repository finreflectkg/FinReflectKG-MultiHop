      "question": "How does the requirement for FCC license renewals under the Communications Act of 1934 influence Disney's television station operations and AT&T's wireless spectrum strategy in terms of capital allocation and regulatory risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Disney's television stations require FCC license renewals every eight years under the Communications Act of 1934, and failure to obtain timely renewals could disrupt operations and impact capital planning for station acquisitions or divestitures. Similarly, AT&T's wireless licenses, which are typically issued for 10 to 15 years, require renewal and are subject to FCC discretion based on public interest. This regulatory uncertainty affects both companies' capital allocation strategies\u2014Disney must plan for potential delays or denials in license renewals when budgeting for media assets, while AT&T must balance investment in spectrum acquisitions with the risk of non-renewal, influencing its competitive positioning and infrastructure spending in the wireless market.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Disney's television stations are licensed by the FCC for up to eight years and require renewal; failure to obtain renewal can result in operational disruption and impact acquisition/divestiture plans.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - AT&T's wireless licenses are issued for 10 to 15 years and must be renewed; the FCC may deny renewal if not in the public interest, affecting capital decisions and competitive strategy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face regulatory risk under the Communications Act of 1934 related to license renewals, which influences their capital allocation decisions and strategic planning in regulated asset categories (broadcast stations for Disney, wireless spectrum for AT&T)."

      "question": "Meta conducted a pay equity analysis in July 2023 confirming pay equity across genders globally and by race in the U.S., while Netflix discloses conducting pay equity analyses at least annually and aims to rectify any pay gaps found. Based on these practices, how frequently did each company conduct pay equity analyses in 2023, and what does this imply about their approaches to addressing pay equity issues?",
      "answer": "Meta conducted at least one pay equity analysis in July 2023, confirming pay equity across genders globally and by race in the U.S. Netflix conducts pay equity analyses at least annually, and in 2023, this practice would have occurred once. While Meta\u2019s single analysis in 2023 suggests a point-in-time validation of equity, Netflix\u2019s annual approach implies a recurring evaluation mechanism to identify and rectify pay disparities. Both companies aim to ensure fair compensation, but Netflix\u2019s annual cadence provides more frequent opportunities to detect and address pay gaps, which could support more proactive management of compensation equity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Meta conducted a pay equity analysis in July 2023 and found pay equity across genders globally and by race in the U.S.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Netflix conducts pay equity analyses at least annually and aims to rectify any pay gaps found through these analyses.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While Meta only explicitly mentions one analysis in 2023, Netflix\u2019s stated policy ensures at least one analysis per year, indicating a more structured and recurring approach. This distinction implies different strategies for monitoring and addressing pay equity."

      "answer": "META's brand reputation has been negatively affected by past controversies involving data misuse, content enforcement, and algorithmic practices, which could deter advertisers and reduce monetization opportunities. This reputational risk, combined with actions taken to enhance user experience (e.g., limiting developer communications), has already affected their advertising revenue. Similarly, NFLX acknowledges limited experience in offering advertising and faces risks related to attracting and retaining advertisers, member dissatisfaction due to ads, and the effectiveness of analytics tools to demonstrate ad value. If both companies fail to maintain strong advertiser relationships, META could see further erosion in ad revenue due to brand distrust, while NFLX may struggle to grow its nascent ad-supported subscription tier, both leading to potential financial underperformance in their advertising-driven revenue streams.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from META evidence - Brand erosion due to data misuse, content enforcement, and algorithmic controversies has affected advertiser confidence and monetization opportunities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from NFLX evidence - NFLX has limited experience in advertising and faces risks in attracting advertisers, member dissatisfaction, and demonstrating ad value through analytics.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on advertiser engagement for revenue growth, but face distinct but impactful challenges that could hinder financial outcomes if advertiser relationships are not successfully maintained."

      "question": "How does the potential for a change of control impact both Meta's corporate governance structure and Netflix's debt obligations, based on their respective 2023 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Meta's corporate governance structure is significantly influenced by Mark Zuckerberg's control over a majority of the voting power of its outstanding capital stock, which allows him to control the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets. This control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control that other stockholders support, or conversely, result in the consummation of such a transaction that other stockholders do not support. On the other hand, Netflix's debt obligations include a provision that allows holders of its Senior Notes to require the company to repay the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of a change of control. This means that a change of control could trigger a significant cash outflow for Netflix, as it would be required to repay up to \u20ac5,170 million in Senior Notes (\u20ac470 million + \u20ac1,300 million + \u20ac1,100 million + \u20ac1,200 million + \u20ac1,100 million). Therefore, while Meta's governance is insulated from change due to concentrated voting power, Netflix faces a direct financial obligation triggered by such a change, impacting its financial flexibility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Mark Zuckerberg controls a majority of the voting power of Meta's outstanding capital stock, allowing him to control key decisions including change of control transactions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Netflix's Senior Notes (totaling \u20ac5,170 million) are repayable at 101% of principal plus accrued interest upon a change of control, at the option of the holders.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Meta's governance structure can prevent or force a change of control due to concentrated voting power, while Netflix would face a mandatory repayment obligation of \u20ac5,170 million if such a change were to occur, showing opposite impacts of the same corporate event on two companies."

NFLX, while also subject to Delaware anti-takeover laws, has a classified board of directors (until 2025), which may delay potential acquisitions, and its board can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.

        "Step 2: Extract from META's filing - 'we qualify as a 'controlled company' under Nasdaq governance rules, allowing non-independent board and committees.'",

      "answer": "Meta's ability to attract and retain users depends on its capacity to obtain engaging third-party content, as stated in its risk factors. If Meta fails to secure such content, it could lead to decreased user engagement, which directly affects its platform's value to advertisers and overall revenue. On the other hand, Netflix explicitly depends on licensing rights from third-party content providers to offer a diverse range of programming to its members. If studios or rights holders do not renew licenses or restrict access, Netflix\u2019s ability to grow or maintain its membership base could be negatively impacted. Together, this shows that both companies rely on third-party content, but in different ways: Meta for user engagement and platform vitality, and Netflix for content availability and service competitiveness.",

META's fixed-rate senior notes increased by $10.5 billion from $18.50 billion in 2023 to $29.0 billion in 2024.

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet  cash  used  in  financing  activities  decreased  in  2024  primarily  due  to  repayment  of  a  collateralized  obligation  in  the  prior  year  (see  Note  7),  a  decrease  in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, lower repurchases and repayments of debt in the current year, repayments of short-term borrowings, net in the prior year and higher proceeds from borrowings in the current year.\n\nIn September 2024, we issued \u20ac1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing in 2032 and 2036 and entered into a corresponding cross-currency swap, effectively converting the debt to an aggregate U.S. dollar principal amount of $2.0 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.72%. We also issued \u00a3750 million ($1.0 billion using ex change rates on the date of issuance) principal amount of fix ed rate sterling senior notes maturing in 2040 with an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from this issuance were intended for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the early redemption of $725 million of  our  outstanding  5.25%  Notes  due  2025,  which  was  completed  in  October  2024,  and  the  repayment  of  certain  of  our  other  outstanding  debt  with  near-term maturities. In May 2024, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes, which have maturities ranging between 2029 and 2054 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38%. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for the repayment of our outstanding commercial paper, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nIn 2024, we made debt repayments of $3.6 billion, including $1.9 billion principal amount of notes due at maturity and $750 million of 5.250% Notes due 2025, $391 million of 3.950% Notes due 2025, $256 million of 3.375% Notes due 2025, and $104 million of 3.150% Notes due 2026.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In January 2024, our Board of Directors terminated our existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion effective as of January 26, 2024, which had no expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased a total of 212 million shares of our Class A common stock for $8.6 billion under our authorization programs. We did not purchase any shares outside of these programs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $7.0 billion remaining under the authorization, and in January 2025, our Board of Directors terminated the existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion, which has no expiration date. We expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.\n\nIn 2024, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.31 per share, including our fourth quarter dividend payable in January 2025 and we made dividend payments of $4.8 billion. In January 2025, our Board of Directors approved a 6.5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.33 per share, to be paid in April 2025. We ex pect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity price risk.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the  U.S. dollar, primarily the  Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other  operating  results  as  ex pressed  in  U.S.  dollars.  See  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  -  Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $690 million, $366 million, and $81 million were recognized in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitivity\n\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.\n\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $680 million and $355 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  we  also  had  aggregate  principal  amounts  of  fix ed-rate  senior  notes  (the  Notes)  outstanding  of  $29.0  billion  and $18.50 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fix ed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\n\n## Equity Price Risk\n\nOur equity investments include marketable and non-marketable equity securities subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the fair value or carrying value of our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privatelyheld companies without readily determinable fair values.",

      "question": "How do Comcast's programming expenses and Meta's fees for third-party content distribution differ in structure, and what impact do these differences have on each company's competitive positioning in digital content markets?",
      "answer": "Comcast incurs programming expenses based on multiyear distribution agreements with per-subscriber fees tied to the number of customers receiving content, with expenses recognized based on contractual rates. This creates predictable but ongoing costs tied directly to subscriber growth. In contrast, Meta pays fees to third parties for content or product distribution that directly affect its cost structure and gross margins. These fees are more variable and influenced by changes in product accessibility and third-party actions. Comcast's structured licensing model supports stable content delivery to consumers, while Meta's payment structure introduces greater margin volatility, affecting how each company competes in digital content markets. Comcast focuses on subscriber-based scalability, while Meta must balance content access with fluctuating distribution costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Comcast's programming expenses are based on multiyear agreements with per-subscriber fees and are recognized based on contractual rates.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Meta pays fees to third parties for content or distribution that affect gross margins and are subject to changes in accessibility due to third-party actions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The structured, subscriber-based expense model at Comcast contrasts with Meta's more variable and margin-sensitive cost structure, leading to different competitive strategies in digital content markets."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Spectrum Allocations\n\nThe FCC, the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other federal agencies have taken, and in some cases are preparing to take, steps to evaluate and potentially modify certain spectrum allocations and rules to make available additional spectrum that likely will be used for licensed and/or unlicensed commercial services, including 5G  and Wi-Fi services, which could impact our businesses. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these spectrum allocation actions. Additional commercial spectrum could impact current marketplace dynamics, including the ability of wireless providers to compete with our services. Further, if the FCC reallocates spectrum that our businesses currently use to provide services, we could be required to transition our operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5G, which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs.\n\n## International Communications-Related and Other Regulations\n\nCertain of our international businesses are subject to telecommunications and media-specific regulation, including those related to broadband and voice services and television networks, in Europe, Latin America, and other international jurisdictions, and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection, and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate. Our international businesses are currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate.\n\n## Other Areas of Regulation\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nCopyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs/Blu-rays and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to ex pend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal  protections  ex ist  to  combat  such  practices,  the  ex tent  of  copyright  protection  is  sometimes  ambiguous  and  the  use  of  technological  protections  can  be controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of ex isting laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\n\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\n\n## Privacy and Data Protection Regulation\n\nOur businesses are subject to laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the processing of individuals' personal information. In the United States, federal privacy laws and regulations, such as those found within the Communications Act or the V ideo Privacy Protection Act, restrict companies' collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information. The proliferation of laws at the state level has expanded consumers' rights to include individual rights of access, deletion, portability, correction, the right to appeal, and the individual's right to 'opt in' to collection and use of certain types of 'sensitive'  personal  information.  Internationally,  many  of  the  laws  that  apply  to  our  businesses  are  similar  to  the  European  Union's  G eneral  Data  Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act of 2018, which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the ex pected lives of our products.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI  and  machine  learning,  electronic  contracts  and  other  communications,  competition,  protection  of  minors,  consumer  protection,  civil  rights,  accessibility, telecommunications,  product  liability,  e-commerce,  tax ation,  economic  or  other  trade  controls  including  sanctions,  anti-corruption  and  political  law  compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\n\nThese  U.S.  federal  and  state,  EU,  and  other  international  laws  and  regulations,  which  in  some  cases  can  be  enforced  by  private  parties  in  addition  to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For ex ample, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections available to online platforms under  Section  230,  and  any  such  changes  may  increase  our  costs  or  require  significant  changes  to  our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For ex ample, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR \u20ac1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage,",

      "question": "How does the reliance on third-party content by Comcast's Peacock and Meta's platform influence their respective competitive positions in the evolving media and social networking landscape?",
      "answer": "Comcast's Peacock depends on third-party content to attract and retain users in a highly fragmented media environment where consumers increasingly prefer DTC streaming services over traditional linear television. However, the rising cost of licensing popular content, especially sports programming, and the risk of content owners pulling their offerings to prioritize their own platforms, threaten Peacock's ability to grow its user base and offset declining linear television revenues. Meanwhile, Meta's platform relies on third-party content to maintain user engagement and attract advertisers, but challenges such as user sentiment issues, regulatory constraints, and competition for engaging content could reduce platform usage and advertising efficiency. Both companies face intensified competition and must adapt to shifting consumer behavior, but their dependence on third-party content introduces distinct risks that could undermine their market positions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Peacock's success depends on third-party content, and rising licensing costs and exclusivity decisions by content owners threaten its growth and ability to offset declines in linear TV.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe number of entertainment choices available to consumers, including DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms,  and  gaming  and  virtual  reality  products  and  services,  continue  to  increase,  intensify  audience  fragmentation  and  disaggregate  how  content traditionally has been distributed to and viewed by consumers. The continuing trend of content owners, including us with Peacock, delivering their content directly to  consumers,  rather  than  through,  or  in  addition  to,  traditional  video  distribution  channels  also  disrupts  traditional  media  distribution  business  models.  As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming services in lieu of linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, our video customers and video revenues, and linear television network subscriber fees received from video service providers, each decrease. In addition to reducing traditional television viewership, these trends when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. Shifting content consumption patterns also may result in lower demand for home entertainment products or theatrical attendance. While we have adapted some of our video and content offerings to compete in the evolving media distribution landscape, such as by offering Peacock and NOW, there also can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete or that Peacock will grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a stand-alone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks' results of operations.\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising time with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers as advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a larger portion of their total expenditures to digital media. We also compete with other online content providers, such as social  networking  platforms  and  user-generated  content  providers,  television  networks  and  stations,  and  all  other  advertising  platforms.  Because  we  derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries and economic conditions generally; increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, audience fragmentation and viewing content on DTC streaming services; use of time-shifting or advertising-blocking technologies; and regulatory intervention on advertising placement. Lower audience ratings  and  reduced  viewership,  which  many  of  our  linear  television  networks  have  ex perienced,  and  likely  will  continue  to  ex perience,  as  well  as  the  level  of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\nWe create and acquire media, sports and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. To meet the changing preferences of our consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute a broad array of content and theme park attractions. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance.\n\nWe obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense. Entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs, potentially over an extended contractual term. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue generated from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights and of producing and distributing the programming. In addition, media companies may determine not to license popular content to us, and as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these contracts on acceptable terms could reduce the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our results of operations and businesses.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nSome of our businesses are also subject to the FTC's general oversight of consumer privacy protections through its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices, as well as through its enforcement authority over the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. The FTC has sought to expand its authority in this area through various rulemakings related to general privacy, targeted advertising and children's privacy. There has been an increased focus on children's privacy at both the state and federal levels within the United States, as well as internationally. These new laws may require changes to our products and services and could adversely affect our advertising businesses.\n\nIn addition, many international data protection laws, some federal laws, and all 50 U.S. states have security breach notification requirements that obligate businesses to provide notice to consumers and government agencies if certain information has been accessed or exfiltrated by an unauthorized party; some of these laws also require documented information security programs.\n\n## State and Local Taxes\n\nSome U.S. states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, our businesses, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are computed, earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax, and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our businesses, most notably new taxes or fees on digital advertising or other digital commerce. In some situations, DBS providers and other competitors (such as DTC streaming service providers) that deliver their services over a broadband connection do not face the same state and local tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors (such as DTC streaming service providers) that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. The Internet Tax Freedom Act ('ITFA') prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges and discriminating against electronic commerce; however, some jurisdictions may challenge the ITFA or the application of the ITFA to our business, or may assert that certain taxes akin to right-of-way fees are not preempted by the ITFA or other federal laws.\n\n## Other Regulations\n\nU.S. states and localities, and various regulatory authorities, actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including our Studios and Theme Parks businesses, accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, cable equipment, pole attachments, universal service fees, regulatory fees, public safety, telemarketing, leased access, indecency, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising,  political  broadcasting,  sponsorship  identification,  Emergency Alert  System,  equal  employment  opportunity  and  other  employment-related  practices, environmental-related matters, our equipment supply chain, and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various similar regulations, including those that cover television broadcasting, programming, and advertising. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities, which can result in fines, sanctions and/or ongoing compliance plans and government oversight.\n\n## Human Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 182,000 full-time and part-time employees calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Approximately 30% of our employees were located in over 30 countries outside the United States, with larger workforce concentrations in the United Kingdom, Western Europe, East Asia and South Asia. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business. A small overall portion of our full-time U.S. employees are unionized, although many of Content &amp; Experiences' freelance and temporary writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements or work councils. Outside the United States, employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.\n\nOur company has been built on a foundation of respect, integrity and trust, and we are committed to creating and fostering a work environment that promotes those values. As a global media and technology company, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, technicians, engineers, call center employees, theme park employees, and media talent and production employees. Some of our key workforce-related programs and initiatives include the following.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\n- We seek to create an engaged workforce through proactive listening and constructive dialogue, including through employee engagement surveys, as well as through employee resource groups.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nAuthorities around the world hav e adopted and are considering a number of legislativ e and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, data usage and portability, and encryption of user data. Additionally, the increasing adoption of AI technologies, which rely on the collection of large amounts of  data  and  use  of  such  data  for  training  purposes,  has  led  data  protection  authorities  around  the  world  to  consider  and  adopt  new  and  ev olv ing interpretations  of  data  protection  laws,  imposing  specific  obligations  with  respect  to  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  required  notices, consents, and opt-outs. Further, the increased risk of inadv ertent disclosure of confidential information or personal data in connection with the utilization of AI technologies may result in stronger regulatory scrutiny, leading to legal and regulatory inv estigations and enforcement actions that may negativ ely affect our business, ev en if unfounded. Adv erse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation hav e resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which hav e had and could continue to hav e an adv erse effect on how we prov ide serv ices, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. T hese laws and regulations are ev olv ing and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and serv ices in ways that harm our business.

      "question": "How do the competitive pressures faced by CMCSA and META's dependency on third-party mobile ecosystems collectively impact their ability to grow advertising revenue in the evolving digital media landscape?",
      "answer": "CMCSA faces competition from a broad array of online content providers, including social networking platforms and user-generated content providers, which affects its ability to retain advertisers and maintain audience share. This competition directly impacts advertising revenue, particularly as advertisers become more hesitant to purchase ads due to declining audience ratings and fragmented viewership. Meanwhile, META's advertising revenue, which is heavily reliant on mobile devices, is constrained by its dependency on third-party mobile ecosystems like Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Changes such as Apple's Safari browser updates limiting third-party cookies and Google's phase-out of cookies in Chrome reduce META's ability to target and measure ad effectiveness, directly impacting monetization. Together, these challenges\u2014CMCSA's competitive environment and META's reliance on external platforms\u2014create dual pressures that hinder both companies' ability to grow and sustain advertising revenue in a rapidly shifting digital media landscape.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA competes with online content providers such as social networking platforms and user-generated content providers, which affects advertiser willingness to purchase ads due to declining audience ratings and fragmented viewership.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - META's advertising revenue is heavily dependent on mobile platforms like iOS and Android, and changes such as Apple's Safari updates and Google's phase-out of third-party cookies limit its ability to target and measure ads effectively.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both CMCSA and META face challenges in maintaining and growing advertising revenue. CMCSA's issues stem from a competitive landscape that dilutes its audience and advertiser appeal, while META's issues stem from external dependencies that reduce ad effectiveness. Together, these pressures reflect broader difficulties in the digital media space for traditional and social media platforms alike."

      "answer": "CMCSA's linear television networks are negatively impacted by content owners delivering their content directly to consumers, reducing both the quantity and quality of licensed content available to CMCSA. This affects their ability to retain customers and maintain subscriber fees, especially as platforms like Peacock compete with traditional models. META, on the other hand, depends on obtaining engaging third-party content to maintain user interest and platform relevance. A failure to attract such content could reduce user engagement and threaten its advertising-based revenue model. Both companies face declining traditional revenue streams and must adapt to shifting consumer preferences, but through different mechanisms: CMCSA through reduced licensing and subscription fees, and META through lower engagement and ad sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA notes that content owners launching their own DTC platforms reduce the quantity and quality of content licensed to CMCSA, impacting subscriber fees and Peacock\u2019s content library.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - META identifies the inability to obtain or attract engaging third-party content as a key risk that could reduce user engagement and platform relevance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on third-party content, but in different ways: CMCSA for traditional and streaming content distribution, and META for maintaining user engagement. The shared risk is that reduced access to third-party content threatens revenue (CMCSA via licensing/subscriptions, META via advertising) and requires strategic adaptation."

Verizon, operating as an incumbent local exchange carrier in nine states and DC, is subject to heightened state oversight and pricing rules for its traditional telephone services, which are classified as common carrier services. Some states, like California, are also considering new service quality and reliability requirements for VoIP, which would apply to Verizon\u2019s wireline voice services.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe, from time to time, participate in broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state levels and may also become subject to additional broadbandrelated commitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding. We cannot predict how and to whom any such funds will be awarded, when the initiatives will be terminated or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses.\n\nA number of municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create governmentowned networks, particularly in light of federal funding for broadband deployment. Certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of government-owned networks. Other states, however, have amended or may amend such laws to facilitate such networks. Much of the federal funding authorized for broadband deployment is conditioned on states agreeing to make it available for potential use by government-owned networks, although the funding prioritizes deployment to unserved and underserved areas and locations. We cannot predict how successful any of those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses.\n\n## Video and Media\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that apply to the cable services we provide through our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms business and to our cable networks and local broadcast television stations in our Media business. These laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete, particularly against DTC streaming service providers, which are not subject to these same requirements.\n\nFederal, state and local franchising rules and regulations may require us to provide adequate channel capacity, facilities and financial support for public, educational and governmental access programming; comply with certain renewal procedures for our franchise agreements; pay franchise fees; and comply with customer service, accessibility, and certain other requirements. In addition, the FCC and other federal agencies can impact the programming networks that we carry, as well as how we price, package, bill and market our video services. FCC regulations also require cable operators to carry programming transmitted by certain local broadcast television stations ('must-carry' requirement) or to negotiate a 'retransmission consent' agreement with certain other stations that will frequently involve payments from cable operators to the station; govern program access by preventing cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video providers; grant licenses to broadcast television stations for 8-year cycles, which may not be renewed on favorable terms, or at all; limit local and national television ownership, as well as foreign ownership in a broadcast television station; and regulate children's programming.\n\nThe FCC enforces these rules on a case-by-case basis based on complaints filed by consumers, state and local governments, and other entities. We have been involved in disputes at the FCC in some of these areas and may be involved in new disputes in the future, including potential disputes related to content moderation and free speech. We cannot predict the outcome of any such disputes or associated litigation. The FCC and Congress have previously considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with MVPDs and potentially with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. We currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis (in 'tiers') and, in various cases, individually. We have been involved in program access disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\n\nFurthermore, certain states and localities have adopted laws to impose franchise or other fees on DTC streaming services. To date, courts have invalidated those laws, but we cannot predict the outcome of any future litigation.\n\n## Wireless\n\nWe offer a wireless voice and data service primarily using our MVNO rights to provide the service over V erizon's wireless network. MVNOs are subject to many of the same FCC regulations as facilities-based wireless carriers, such as E911 services and local number portability, as well as certain state or local regulations. The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile broadband providers in the future, which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally.\n\n## Voice\n\nWe provide voice services using V oIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including  regulations  relating  to  privacy  of  customer  proprietary  network  information,  local  number  portability  duties  and  benefits,  disability  access,  E911,  law enforcement  assistance,  outage  reporting,  Universal  Service  Fund  contribution  obligations,  rural  call  completion,  customer  equipment  back-up  power,  robocall mitigation, service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level.\n\n13\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Broadband\n\nVerizon offers many different broadband services. In early January 2025, based on litigation filed by the broadband industry , a federal appeals court overturned the FCC's April 2024 final decision to regulate broadband services via utility-style common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications A ct. A bsent further action in the courts, this decision will remain in effect and limit the risk of burdensome FCC broadband regulation. In addition to federal activity , several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our broadband services, including a law in New Y ork that requires discounted broadband pricing for low income customers. Some states may also impose pricing or other rules related to broadband built with the assistance of federal or state funding. The FCC also adopted broad rules related to \"digital discrimination\" that could further increase regulatory oversight of broadband services; industry groups have appealed those rules in court. Our broadband commitment can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-commitment.\n\n## Wireline Voice\n\nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as V oIP . For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of V oIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.\n\nState public utility  commissions regulate V erizon's telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. V erizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. V erizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. Some states, including California, impose reporting requirements and are considering new network reliability or service quality requirements for wireline voice services, including for V oIP.\n\n## Video\n\nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to V erizon. In areas where V erizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, V erizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.\n\n## Privacy, Data Protection, and Artificial Intelligence\n\nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products. A t the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending on the product or service. The California Consumer Privacy A ct, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and a number of other privacy laws more recently adopted by other states and countries include significant penalties for non-compliance. Generally , attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally , and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations.  These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. Policymakers at the local, state, federal and international levels are also considering imposing laws and regulations on the use of artificial intelligence (A I). This is a nascent area of regulatory focus; therefore, it is unclear how such regulation could impact our business.\n\n## Public Safety and Cybersecurity\n\nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media  (broadcast/cable)  and  wireless  emergency  alerting  services.  In  addition,  federal  and  state  agencies  have  mandated  and  may  impose  additional regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless providers to support roaming on each other's networks during disasters, and the California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations relating to back-up power for communications facilities. In response to prior  cyberattacks  and  increasing  risks  from  cybersecurity  threats,  the  FCC  and  other  regulators  are  attempting  to  increase  regulation  of  the cybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by A merican companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. V eriz on does not currently  use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions.\n\n## Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access\n\nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. V erizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments.",

      "answer": "Verizon competes directly with AT&T in the wireless services market, as stated in its 2024 10-K, with competition based on network performance, pricing, and bundled services. Meanwhile, Comcast's peer group for stock performance comparison includes AT&T, indicating that investors and analysts evaluate Comcast alongside AT&T and other major telecom players. This creates a strategic dynamic where AT&T is simultaneously a peer for stock benchmarking (via Comcast's peer group inclusion) and a direct competitor to Verizon, suggesting that AT&T's performance and strategic moves can influence both the investor perception of Comcast and the competitive landscape Verizon must navigate.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Spectrum\n\nThe spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on the following low and mid-band spectrum in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the U.S.: (i) the 700 M Hz Upper C block, (ii) Cellular spectrum (850 M Hz), (iii) Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum (1900 M Hz), (iv) AWS 1 and AWS 3 bands (1700 MHz uplink and 2100 M Hz downlink), and (v) the 3.7 GHz band (C-Band). We also hold spectrum licenses in the 28, Upper 37 and 39 GHz bands, known as millimeter wave spectrum, and utilize both Priority A ccess Licenses (PA Ls) and General A uthorized A ccess (GA A ) in the 3.5 GHz band (Citiz ens Broadband Radio Service).\n\nWe anticipate that demand for spectrum will continue to increase over time, driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We expect to meet the demand for 5G and 4G spectrum needs with our existing spectrum assets. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology , we can meet that demand by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur.\n\nFrom time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. We also gain access to spectrum through cross-lease transactions. In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market.  Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency .  These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.\n\nInformation regarding spectrum license transactions, including our pending acquisition of select spectrum licenses of United States Cellular Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, is presented in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this A nnual Report.\n\n## Competition and Related Trends\n\nThe  telecommunications  industry  is  highly  competitive.  The  rapid  development  of  new  technologies,  services  and  products  has  eliminated  many  of  the distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and traditional telephone services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.\n\nCompetitive factors within the telecommunications industry include, among others, network reliability , speed, capacity and coverage; pricing and promotional strategies; the quality of customer service; marketing, sales and distribution capabilities; development of new and enhanced products and services; the ability to anticipate and respond to various factors and trends affecting our industry; the availability of capital resources; and regulatory changes.\n\nCompetition remains intense as a result of various factors, including aggressive pricing, increased levels of promotions and service plan discounts, and offerings that include additional bundled premium content or other perks, in some cases specifically targeting V erizon customers. Competition may increase as smaller, stand-alone  wireless  service  providers  merge  or  transfer  licenses  to  larger,  better  capitalized  wireless  service  providers  and  as  M V NOs  resell  wireless communication services. In addition, aggressive network deployment as well as increasing government incentives related to it may enhance the ability of certain of our competitors to compete with us.\n\nWith respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including A T&amp;T Inc. and T-M obile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. W e also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service  providers,  including  V erizon,  and  resell  it  to  their  customers.  Resellers  include  cable  companies,  such  as  Comcast  Corporation  and  Charter Communications, Inc., and others. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.\n\nWe also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture market share with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, M icrosoft Corporation, A lphabet Inc., Apple Inc., M eta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we are seeing increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed wireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers.\n\nWith  respect  to  Fios  and  our  other  broadband  services,  we  compete  against  cable  companies,  wireless  service  providers,  domestic  and  foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, low Earth orbit satellite companies, internet service providers, OTT providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.

In contrast, VZ recognizes wireless service revenue using an output method, either as service allowance units are used or as time elapses, with postpaid plans billed in advance, resulting in a contract liability. The difference lies in CMCSA's focus on rate increases for small business wireless services and VZ's structured billing approach tied to usage or elapsed time, with revenue recognition occurring as service is rendered.",

For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. M onthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability . See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).\n\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability , and serv ice rev enue is recogniz ed ov er the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\n\n## Equipment\n\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the V erizon brand and other brands.  Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we  have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans (for our Business customers) and device payment plans.\n\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically  for a term of 36 months or less).\n\nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, ty pically  ov er a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.\n\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitativ e and quantitativ e considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fix ed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately . See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.\n\n## Wireless Contracts\n\nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.\n\nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The total",

      "question": "How does the launch of CMCSA's domestic NOW TV service in 2023, which is only available to residential broadband customers and includes access to the ad-supported tier of Peacock, affect the competitive dynamics with DIS's ESPN+ DTC service, given that both compete for viewers' attention and advertising revenue in the DTC streaming market?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's 2023 launch of the domestic NOW TV service, which includes access to Peacock's ad-supported tier and is limited to residential broadband customers, directly enters the DTC streaming market where DIS's ESPN+ operates. This intensifies competition for viewer attention and advertising dollars. DIS's ESPN+ competes with other DTC streaming services, including NOW TV, for audience share and advertising revenue. The targeted availability of NOW TV to broadband subscribers creates a strategic overlap in customer base, increasing pressure on ESPN+ to differentiate its content and maintain subscriber growth. This competitive pressure is compounded by the fact that both companies are vying for advertising revenue from the same pool of advertisers in a fragmented media landscape.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - CMCSA launched a domestic NOW TV service in 2023 that is only offered to residential broadband customers and includes access to the ad-supported tier of Peacock.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - DIS's ESPN+ DTC service competes with other DTC streaming services for viewers' attention and advertising revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The launch of CMCSA's NOW TV service directly impacts DIS's ESPN+ by intensifying competition in the DTC streaming market, particularly for audience share and advertising revenue, due to the overlap in target customer base and service offerings."

      "question": "How does the production of entertainment content by Comcast (CMCSA) and Disney (DIS) differ in terms of business structure and associated risks?",
      "answer": "Comcast produces entertainment content through its Content & Experiences business, which is structured into three segments: Media, Studios, and Theme Parks. This business creates and distributes entertainment, sports, and news content globally through platforms such as NBC, Telemundo, Universal, Peacock, and Sky. In contrast, Disney highlights that its entertainment content production is closely tied to consumer preferences and distribution platforms like theatrical releases, broadcast, cable, and direct-to-consumer (DTC) services. Disney explicitly states that misalignment with evolving consumer tastes\u2014especially for out-of-home entertainment like theatrical releases and theme park attractions\u2014can significantly impact revenue and profitability. Additionally, Disney emphasizes the risk of unpredictable market conditions at the time of product release, which may differ from expectations at the time of investment, making its content production more exposed to consumer demand volatility compared to Comcast\u2019s integrated platform delivery model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CMCSA_10k_2023.pdf, identify that Comcast produces entertainment content through its Content & Experiences business, which includes Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments.",
        "Step 2: From DIS_10k_2023.pdf, identify that Disney's entertainment content is closely tied to consumer preferences and distribution platforms such as theatrical releases, broadcast, cable, and DTC services.",
        "Step 3: Contrast Comcast's structured, platform-based content delivery (NBC, Telemundo, Universal, Peacock, Sky) with Disney's explicit risk around unpredictable consumer demand and market conditions at the time of release.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize that while both companies produce entertainment content, Comcast emphasizes integrated delivery through owned platforms, whereas Disney highlights greater exposure to consumer preference volatility and investment risk."

      "question": "Meta relies on resellers for distribution of its Reality Labs products like the Meta Quest, while Verizon uses resellers in its Business Markets segment. Given that Meta's RL revenue was $24.0 billion in 2023 and Verizon's Business Markets & Other revenues were $12.7 billion in 2023, how might the strategic importance of resellers differ between these two companies in terms of revenue generation and business focus?",
      "answer": "Meta's strategic importance of resellers centers on distributing its hardware products like the Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which are critical to its Reality Labs (RL) revenue stream that generated $24.0 billion in 2023. These resellers are essential for reaching both consumer and enterprise markets for its immersive technology products. In contrast, Verizon's use of resellers in its Business Markets & Other segment, which generated $12.7 billion in 2023, focuses on delivering tailored enterprise solutions, including wireless services, equipment, and integrated mobility services. The resellers in Verizon's case support more complex business-to-business offerings rather than consumer hardware.

      "question": "How does the role of resellers in Meta's sales strategy for its Reality Labs products compare to Verizon's competitive positioning against resellers in the wireless service market?",
      "answer": "Meta utilizes resellers as part of its third-party sales channels to drive consumer and enterprise sales of its Reality Labs products like the Meta Quest portfolio and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, aligning with its broader strategy to expand market reach. In contrast, Verizon faces competitive pressure from resellers that buy bulk wholesale wireless services and resell them to customers, including cable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications, which directly compete with Verizon's retail activations. These resellers are positioned as cost-effective alternatives, often leveraging aggressive pricing and bundling strategies that challenge Verizon's market position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that Meta uses resellers as part of its third-party sales channels for Reality Labs products such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract that Verizon faces competition from resellers that buy bulk wholesale wireless services and resell them, including cable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While Meta leverages resellers to expand sales and adoption of its hardware products, Verizon views resellers as competitive threats that undercut its retail offerings through pricing and bundling strategies."

      "answer": "VZ's expansion of 5G network infrastructure enhances network quality and connectivity, which is critical for META to deliver high-quality mobile products. META states that its ability to provide a high-quality mobile experience depends on working well with mobile technologies, systems, and networks that it does not control. VZ's 5G build-out supports better mobile performance, which in turn helps META maintain user engagement and monetization. However, META also faces challenges from changes in mobile ecosystems, such as Apple's iOS updates and Google's phasing out of third-party cookies, which limit its ability to target and measure ads effectively. Therefore, while VZ's 5G improvements provide a stronger underlying network, META's monetization is still constrained by platform-level changes beyond its control.",

      "answer": "Netflix discloses a potential exposure of approximately $300 million related to non-income tax assessments by Brazilian tax authorities, which is expected to increase over time. In contrast, Google does not specify a dollar amount of potential exposure but states that it accrues non-income taxes when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and discloses reasonably possible losses if they can be estimated. This shows that Netflix provides a concrete estimate of its exposure in Brazil, while Google takes a more generalized approach to accrual and disclosure without quantifying specific risks in different jurisdictions.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a (GOOGL), extract the approach to non-income tax accrual \u2014 Google accrues taxes when a loss is probable and estimable and discloses reasonably possible losses if estimable.",

      "question": "Given Google's 2023 disclosure of significant investments in platform security and incident response capabilities, and Netflix's 2023 focus on enhancing user interface to improve content discovery, how do these distinct strategic investments reflect different approaches to maintaining user engagement in the streaming and digital platform ecosystem?",
      "answer": "Google's 2023 10-K highlights significant investments in security measures, including dedicated worldwide incident response teams to address cybersecurity threats and platform abuses that could harm user trust and engagement. These efforts are aimed at preventing unauthorized access to user data, mitigating cyber attacks, and maintaining platform integrity, which are critical for sustaining user trust in their digital ecosystem. In contrast, Netflix's 2023 10-K emphasizes investments in enhancing the user interface to help members more easily choose content they will enjoy, directly tying interface improvements to their core strategy of growing the business globally while improving the member experience. While Google focuses on protecting user data and platform security to maintain trust, Netflix prioritizes interface optimization to enhance content discovery and user satisfaction, reflecting divergent approaches to user engagement within the digital platform ecosystem.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Google's 2023 10-K, extract the detail about 'significant investments in safety, security, and content review' and the mention of 'dedicated worldwide incident response teams' to address cybersecurity threats.",
        "Step 2: From Netflix's 2023 10-K, extract the detail that the company is 'continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable' as part of its core strategy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two strategies: Google's investment in security is aimed at preserving user trust through platform integrity, while Netflix's investment in user interface is designed to improve content discovery and satisfaction, showing different strategic priorities for user engagement in the digital ecosystem."

      "answer": "Google has a content licensing commitment of $10.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, with the majority paid over seven years, providing a structured financial obligation with defined timelines. In contrast, Netflix does not disclose a specific advertising revenue figure but highlights significant uncertainty in its advertising revenue growth, citing numerous risks such as advertiser retention, member engagement, regulatory changes, and liability from advertisements. While Google's content licensing represents a predictable long-term expense, Netflix's advertising revenue model carries higher business risk due to its dependence on volatile factors like advertiser confidence, measurement tools, and regulatory developments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Google's 10-K, extract the specific content licensing commitment of $10.6 billion, indicating a defined financial obligation with a seven-year payment structure.",

        "Step 3: Compare the structured, long-term nature of Google's content licensing with Netflix's exposure to fluctuating advertising revenue, highlighting contrasting levels of financial certainty and business risk exposure."

      "answer": "Both Google and Netflix explicitly disclose their dependence on internet access and the potential financial impacts of increased bandwidth costs. Google states that internet access providers may 'charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.' Netflix similarly notes that if network operators implement 'usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps,' it could 'incur greater operating expenses and negatively impact member acquisition and retention.' While neither company provides a specific dollar figure or percentage related to potential cost increases, both emphasize that rising bandwidth costs could significantly affect their operating expenses and user growth. This implies that both companies face substantial financial exposure due to their reliance on internet access providers, and any changes in pricing models could directly impact their cost structures and scalability.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Google states that increased fees for internet access could lead to 'additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.'",

      "answer": "NFLX's Senior Notes require the company to repay holders at 101% of principal plus accrued interest upon a change of control, creating a significant financial obligation if such an event occurs. Meanwhile, GOOGL's concentrated ownership structure\u2014where Larry Page and Sergey Brin control approximately 51.5% of the voting power\u2014makes a change of control less likely without their consent. This concentrated ownership is further reinforced by structural provisions like the lack of voting rights for Class C shares and the Board's ability to fill vacancies, which together insulate GOOGL from unsolicited takeovers. Therefore, while NFLX faces a direct financial risk from a change of control, GOOGL's governance structure actively discourages such an event, creating a dynamic where NFLX could face liquidity pressure in a takeover scenario that GOOGL is structurally designed to resist.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GOOGL has concentrated stock ownership where Larry Page and Sergey Brin control 51.5% of voting power, and structural provisions (e.g., no cumulative voting, no written consent) discourage takeovers.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NFLX's Senior Notes must be repaid at 101% of principal plus interest upon a change of control, at the holder's option.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - GOOGL's governance structure makes a change of control unlikely, reducing the risk of triggering NFLX-like financial obligations, while NFLX would face a liquidity risk if such an event were to occur."

AT&T, in the case of DIRECTV (a VIE), concluded it is not the primary beneficiary because DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on key decisions, including the appointment/removal of the CEO. This governance structure prevents AT&T from having unilateral control, aligning with Google's VIE consolidation framework that requires both power and loss absorption to consolidate.",

      "answer": "The increasing market saturation in developed countries negatively affects both Google's device business and AT&T's wireless customer growth. For Google, the saturation leads to shorter product life cycles, increased competition, and pressure on pricing and feature sensitivity, which adversely affects their consolidated margins, particularly in the devices segment. For AT&T, market saturation causes the wireless industry's customer growth rate to moderate, increasing competition for customers and putting pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for fewer new customers. These dynamics force both companies to invest heavily in innovation and network improvements, respectively, further straining profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Google's devices segment faces increased market saturation in developed countries, leading to shorter product life cycles, increased competition, and pressure on pricing and feature sensitivity, which adversely affects consolidated margins.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by market saturation in developed markets, which limits customer growth and forces increased investment to retain or attract customers, ultimately harming margins."

      "question": "How does Google's capital allocation strategy in wearables, as described in its 2023 10-K, contrast with AT&T's subscriber growth performance in wearables connectivity services, and what financial risk does this pose to Google's consolidated margins?",
      "answer": "Google's 2023 10-K highlights that its investments in wearables are part of a broader strategy to innovate across devices, but acknowledges significant risks including market saturation, short product life cycles, and pricing pressures that could harm its financial condition and operating results. The company specifically notes that margins on its devices, including wearables, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on consolidated margins due to pricing pressures and higher cost of sales. In contrast, AT&T's 2023 10-K shows strong subscriber growth in wearables and other connected devices, with 639,000 net adds in 2023, although this number reflects a decline from 1,020,000 net adds in 2022. This suggests growing but decelerating demand for wearable connectivity services. The contrast highlights that while AT&T is experiencing continued, albeit slowing, growth in wearable connectivity adoption, Google faces uncertain returns and margin pressures from its wearable device investments, which could undermine its overall profitability despite the expanding market.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Google's 2023 10-K states that its wearable investments face risks such as market saturation, short product life cycles, and pricing pressures that could harm financial performance and that margins on devices have had an adverse effect on consolidated margins.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - AT&T's 2023 10-K reports 639,000 net adds for wearables in 2023, a decline from 1,020,000 in 2022, indicating growing but decelerating demand for wearable connectivity services.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Google is investing heavily in wearable devices despite risks of low margins and uncertain returns, while AT&T, as a service provider for wearables, is seeing continued (though slowing) subscriber growth. This contrast reveals a strategic divergence: Google is betting capital on hardware innovation with uncertain financial outcomes, while AT&T benefits from steady, if moderating, growth in wearable connectivity subscriptions."

      "answer": "Google discloses that it pays software developers as part of its Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), which include amounts paid to distribution partners who make available Google's search access points and services. These payments are a direct component of Google's cost of revenues and are tied to its advertising and distribution model. In contrast, AT&T discloses that it enters into software licensing agreements with software developers as part of its network infrastructure modernization, particularly in transitioning to software-based technologies and 5G wireless development. These licensing costs are part of AT&T's capital expenditures and operational investments in network upgrades. The financial obligations differ in that Google's payments are revenue-sharing arrangements tied to distribution, while AT&T's are licensing fees tied to infrastructure development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Google's TAC includes payments to software developers as part of its distribution partner arrangements, which is a direct cost of revenue.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, AT&T's engagement with software developers involves licensing agreements to support network infrastructure modernization, which affects capital and operational costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that while both companies engage with software developers, the nature and financial structure of these engagements differ significantly based on their core business models\u2014Google's advertising/distribution model vs. AT&T's infrastructure/telecom model."

AT&T discloses that if the WarnerMedia distribution fails to qualify for non-recognition treatment under audit, it could face significant tax liability despite receiving a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the IRS.

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## Dollars in millions ex cept per share amounts\n\nDue to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. Further, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our suppliers, vendors and other service providers. In addition, despite our efforts to detect unlawful intrusions, an attack may persist for an ex tended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it may take considerable time for us to obtain sufficient information about the nature, scope and timing of the incident as well as the impact or reasonably likely impact on us. Indeed, as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, a post-attack investigation may not be able to ascertain the entire scope of the attack's impact.\n\nExtensive and costly efforts are undertaken to develop and test systems before deployment and to conduct ongoing monitoring and updating to prevent and withstand such attacks. While the Company may have contractual rights to assess the effectiveness of many of its suppliers' and vendors' systems and protocols, the Company cannot know or assess the effectiveness of all of our providers' systems and controls at all times. While, to date, we have not been subject to a cyberattack that has had a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations, the preventive actions we take, or our suppliers or vendors take, to reduce the risks associated with cyberattacks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyberattack in the future.\n\n## Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions or terrorist or other hostile acts could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.\n\nOur business operations could be subject to interruption by equipment or network failures caused by human error, system failures, unauthorized access to our network and critical infrastructure, power outages, terrorist or other hostile acts, including acts of war, and natural disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes and forest fires. Such events could cause significant damage to the infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy and other measures we take to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of such events may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. Any of these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits.\n\n## Increases in our debt levels to fund spectrum purchases, or other strategic decisions could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rates and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trends.\n\nWe have incurred debt to fund significant acquisitions, as well as spectrum purchases needed to compete in our industry. While we believe such decisions were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunities and respond to industry developments, we did experience credit rating downgrades from historical levels. Banks and potential purchasers of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decisions and similar actions we may take in the future, as well as ex pected trends in the industry, will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand a higher rate of interest, impose restrictive covenants or otherwise limit the amount of potential borrowing. Additionally, our capital allocation plan is focused on, among other things, managing our debt level going forward. Any failure to successfully execute this plan could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\n\n## Our business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, judicial interpretations of the same or administrative actions by federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities.\n\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against ever-changing products and services provided by our global telecommunications and technology businesses. In addition, tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax  rate, tax  liabilities and carrying value of deferred tax assets or deferred tax  liabilities. Any of these changes could materially impact our financial performance and our tax  provision, net income and cash flows.\n\nWe are also subject to ongoing examinations by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of provisions for taxes, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. In the event that we have not accurately or fully described, disclosed or determined, calculated or remitted amounts that were due to taxing authorities or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, we could be subject to additional taxes, penalties and interest, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## If the distribution of WarnerMedia, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes under audit, then we could be subject to significant tax liability.\n\nIn connection with the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, AT&amp;T received a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Nonetheless, the IRS or another applicable tax authority could determine on audit that the distribution by us of WarnerMedia to our stockholders and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions",

      "answer": "Netflix faces competitive pressure from cable companies that are increasing their streaming video offerings, which threatens its market share and profitability. This is evident in Netflix's 2023 10-K, where it mentions that traditional providers, including cable network operators, have large content libraries, strong brand recognition, and significant financial resources. As a result, Netflix has focused heavily on original programming ($17 billion content spend in 2023) to differentiate itself and retain members. In contrast, AT&T faces competition from cable companies in its broadband and legacy voice/data segments, as noted in its 2023 10-K, where it states that cable companies are major competitors for high-speed internet and voice services. AT&T's response includes investing in fiber infrastructure and IP-based network transitions, with $954 million in R&D expenses in 2023 focused on advanced network design and cybersecurity. Thus, while Netflix's strategy centers on content differentiation, AT&T's centers on network innovation and infrastructure modernization to maintain competitiveness.",

      "answer": "NFLX holds \u20ac5,170 million in foreign currency-denominated debt, which resulted in a $176 million remeasurement loss during 2023. This debt is not hedged and is subject to foreign exchange risk, as NFLX does not use derivatives to offset currency fluctuations. In contrast, T manages $38,006 million in foreign-denominated debt through cross-currency swaps, which convert foreign debt payments into fixed-rate U.S. dollars, thereby mitigating both interest rate and foreign exchange risk. T\u2019s swaps had a fair value loss of $3,177 million at year-end, but these losses are intended to offset gains or losses in the hedged debt. The total foreign currency debt referenced across both companies is \u20ac5,170 million (NFLX) + $38,006 million (T) = approximately $43,774 million when converted at a rough exchange rate of 1.07.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the difference in foreign exchange risk management: NFLX does not hedge its foreign currency debt, leading to direct exposure and remeasurement losses, while T uses swaps to convert foreign debt into fixed-rate USD, offsetting currency and interest rate risk.",

If an actual or perceiv ed breach of our or our business partners' or serv ice prov iders' security occurs, the market perception of the effectiv eness of our security measures would be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWhile  we  hav e  dedicated  significant  resources  to  priv acy  and  security  incident  response  capabilities,  including  dedicated  worldwide  incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the sev erity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prev ent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident.

Our reputation has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by unfavorable publicity  regarding,  for  ex ample,  our  privacy  practices,  advertising  policies,  product  decisions,  product  quality,  litigation  or  regulatory  activity,  government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, our management, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours. For example, we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics.

In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with geopolitical events and elections in the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\n\n## We are subject to the risk of catastrophic events and crises, which may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations.\n\nWe are subject to the risk of public health crises such as pandemics, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorism, geopolitical conflict,  other  physical  security  threats,  power  loss,  cyber-attacks,  and  other  catastrophic  events  and  crises.  For  ex ample,  the  COV ID-19  pandemic  previously significantly impacted our business and results of operations. In particular, the pandemic led to volatility in the demand for and pricing of our advertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may experience similar effects in the future as a result of the pandemic or other catastrophic events. Such events also expose our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including: volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement; delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages; significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future; illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements. Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory actions against us.\n\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in our artificial intelligence initiatives as well as Reality Labs, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\n\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement.

If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm our business.\n\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, our marketers do not  have  long-term  advertising  commitments  with  us.  Many  of  our  marketers  spend  only  a  relatively  small  portion  of  their  overall  advertising  budget  with  us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the demand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\n\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\n\n- decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\n- our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\n- product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;\n- our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\n- our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\n- changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\n- adverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that may impact certain advertisers' ability to advertise on our platform or our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\n- user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we monetize at a higher rate, such as our Feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging products;\n- reductions of advertising due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform or that we believe are needed to comply with global content, security, or integrity obligations;",

      "answer": "For Google, a 10% reduction in ad visibility due to ad-blocking would result in a proportional 10% decline in its advertising revenue, which accounts for over 75% of total revenue. If we assume Google\u2019s total revenue in 2024 was $280 billion (hypothetical example figure for illustration), its advertising revenue would be approximately $210 billion (75%), and a 10% reduction would equate to a $21 billion loss in advertising revenue. For Meta, while the exact percentage of advertising revenue is not provided, the company explicitly states that its ability to deliver ad impressions is critical to revenue. A 10% reduction in ad visibility would similarly reduce its ad revenue, though the exact dollar impact cannot be calculated without knowing Meta\u2019s total advertising revenue for the year. The question highlights how both companies are vulnerable to the same risk factor, but the lack of a specific advertising revenue figure for Meta prevents a full parallel calculation.",

We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes, wireless gateways, developing smart televisions using our technology platform, and the operation of Peacock. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors' product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.\n\nA cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those that are related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. In  the  ordinary  course  of  our  business,  there  are  constant  attempts  by  third  parties  to  cause  systems-related  events  and  security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malicious social engineering, and other malicious activities. Incidents also may be caused inadvertently by us or our thirdparty vendors, such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.\n\nCyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold  with  increasing  speed  across  networks,  information  systems  and  other  technologies  across  the  world  and  create  latent vulnerabilities in our and third-party vendors' systems and other technologies. Moreover, as we also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third party vendors who agree to protect it, we face the risk that this information may become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive opensource  software),  applications,  and  data  hosting  and  cloud-based  services  into  many  aspects  of  our  products,  services  and operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks on such third-party suppliers and service providers.\n\nWhile we develop and maintain systems, and operate extensive programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents have in the past, and  could  in  the  future,  cause  a  variety  of  potential  adverse  business  impacts.  These  include  degradation  or  disruption  of  our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption  of  the  security  of  our  internal  systems,  products,  services  or  satellite  transmission  signals,  power  outages,  and  the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our or our customers' or vendors' data, equipment and reputation. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result.  In  addition,  any  such  events  could  lead  to  litigation  or  cause  regulators  in  the  United  States  and  internationally  to impose significant fines or other remedial measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA  substantial  portion  of  our  revenue  comes  from  customers  whose  spending  patterns  may  be  affected  by  prevailing  economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of Cable Communications' or Sky's services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming and other OTT services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions (as well as natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), terrorist attacks or other similar events).\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party's systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party 'cloud' computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series, documentaries and feature films and offer mobile games in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party 'cloud' computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\n## We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services ('AWS') provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a \"cloud\" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\n\n## If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network ('CDN'). To the extent Internet Service Providers ('ISPs') do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN's operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of 'bugs' or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members' devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.",

Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs  are  based  on  anticipated  release  patterns  and  distribution  strategies,  public  acceptance  and  historical  results  for  similar productions.  Amortization  for  content  predominantly  monetized  with  other  owned  or  licensed  content  is  recorded  based  on estimated  usage.  In  determining  the  method  of  amortization  and  estimated  life  of  an  acquired  film  or  television  library,  we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do  not  capitalize  costs  related  to  the  distribution  of  a  film  in  movie  theaters  or  the  licensing  or  sale  of  a  film  or  television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter  into  cofinancing  arrangements  with  third  parties  to  jointly  finance  or  distribute  certain  of  our  film  productions. Cofinancing  arrangements  can  take  various  forms,  but  in  most  cases  involve  the  grant  of  an  economic  interest  in  a  film  to  an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor's  interest  in  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  film  is  recorded  as  either  a  charge  or  a  benefit,  respectively,  in  programming  and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and  record  an  impairment  charge  to  the  extent  the  unamortized  costs  exceed  the  fair  value.  Owned  content  is  assessed  either individually  or  in  identified  film  groups,  for  content  predominantly  monetized  on  an  individual  basis  or  with  other  content, respectively.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  owned  content  is  evaluated  for  impairment  on  an  individual  title  basis.  Licensed content that  is  not  part  of  a  film  group  is  generally  assessed  in  packages,  channels  or  dayparts. A  daypart  is  an  aggregation  of programs  broadcast  during  a  particular  time  of  day  or  programs  of  a  similar  type.  Licensed  content  is  tested  for  impairment primarily  on  a  channel,  network  or  platform  basis,  with  the  exception  of  our  broadcast  networks  and  owned  local  broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative  value.  Estimated  relative  value  is  generally  based  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  and  potential  revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment.  When  cash  payments,  including  advanced  payments,  exceed  the  relative  value  of  the  sports  rights  delivered,  we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\n\n## Note 5: Income Taxes\n\n## Income Before Income Taxes\n\n",

      "question": "Given both companies' positions in the content-driven media industry, how does Netflix's transparent disclosure of licensed content spending contrast with Comcast's accounting methodology for licensed content costs, and what implications does this have for understanding their respective content investment strategies?",
      "answer": "Netflix provides transparent disclosure of its licensed content spending, reporting $8,055,811,000 in 2021, $7,544,631,000 in 2020, and $7,242,799,000 in 2019, showing a consistent upward trend in investment. In contrast, Comcast's accounting methodology for licensed content involves capitalizing costs when the license period begins and the content becomes available for use, with amortization occurring as the content is broadcast. This approach reflects a more controlled recognition of expenses over time, rather than upfront disclosure. The difference in approaches suggests that Netflix prioritizes transparency and immediate recognition of content costs, while Comcast manages content costs through a structured amortization process, impacting how investors might assess their respective investment strategies in content.",

Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.

Estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.\n\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified.

Licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and  are  not  subject  to  impairment.

In November 2020, we amended one of our $7,500 revolving credit agreements by extending the termination date. In total, we have two $7,500 revolving credit agreements, totaling $15,000, with one terminating on December 11, 2023 and the other terminating on November 17, 2025. No amounts were outstanding under either agreement as of December 31, 2021.\n\nOn January 29, 2021, we entered into a $14,700 Term Loan Credit Agreement (2021 Syndicated Term Loan), with Bank of America, N.A., as agent. On March 23, 2021, we borrowed $7,350 under the 2021 Syndicated Term Loan, and the remaining $7,350 of lenders' commitments was terminated. As of December 31, 2021, $7,350 was outstanding and is due on March 22, 2022.\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into and drew on a $2,000 term loan credit agreement (BAML Bilateral Term Loan) consisting of (i) a $1,000 facility originally due December 31, 2021 (BAML Tranche A Facility) and subsequently extended to December 31, 2022 in the fourth quarter of 2021, and (ii) a $1,000 facility due December 31, 2022 (BAML Tranche B Facility), with Bank of America, N.A., as agent. At December 31, 2021, $2,000 was outstanding under these facilities.\n\nWe also utilize other external financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.\n\nEach of our credit and loan agreements contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&amp;T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through June 30, 2023, a ratio of not more than 4.0-to-1, and a ratio of not more than 3.5-to-1 for any fiscal quarter thereafter. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.\n\n## Collateral Arrangements\n\nMost of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&amp;T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover approximately 97% of our approximate $41,000 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During 2021, we posted approximately $770 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 13)\n\n## Other\n\nOur total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year) and stockholders' equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At December 31, 2021, our debt ratio was 49.1%, compared to 46.7% at December 31, 2020 and 44.7% at December 31, 2019. Our net debt ratio was 43.2% at December 31, 2021, compared to 43.8% at December 31, 2020 and 41.4% at December 31, 2019. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances and repayments.\n\nA significant amount of our cash outflows is related to tax items, acquisition of spectrum through FCC auctions and benefits paid for current and former employees:\n\n- Total taxes incurred, collected and remitted by AT&amp;T during 2021 and 2020, were $21,739 and $21,967. These taxes include income, franchise, property, sales, excise, payroll, gross receipts and various other taxes and fees.\n- Total domestic spectrum acquired primarily through FCC auctions, including cash, exchanged spectrum and auction deposits was approximately $25,400 in 2021, $2,800 in 2020 and $1,300 in 2019.\n- Total health and welfare benefits provided to certain active and retired employees and their dependents totaled $3,617 in 2021 and $3,656 in 2020, with $1,163 paid from plan assets in 2021 compared to $1,029 in 2020. Of those benefits, $3,210 related to medical and prescription drug benefits in 2021 compared to $3,293 in 2020. In addition, in 2021, we prefunded $685 for future benefit payments versus $745 in 2020. We paid $5,942 of pension benefits out of plan assets in 2021 compared to $5,124 in 2020.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment with a subsidiary of Discovery. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. We expect to receive $43,000 (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. (See Note 6)",

      "answer": "CMCSA competes directly with DIRECTV, a DBS provider, in the U.S. video services market, where DIRECTV offers features and packaging comparable to CMCSA\u2019s offerings. Meanwhile, T holds a junior preferred unit with $3,212 of remaining distribution rights and common units with a $4,200 distribution preference in DIRECTV as of December 31, 2021, after restructuring its stake through a July 2021 transaction with TPG. Despite holding 70% of common units, T shares governance with TPG, which has tie-breaking authority on key decisions. This indicates that while CMCSA competes with DIRECTV in the market, T maintains a strategic but minority-aligned financial interest in DIRECTV\u2019s operations, without full control, highlighting a contrast in their market roles: one as a direct competitor and the other as a partial stakeholder with limited governance influence.",

Our technical services group performs various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our cable distribution system. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetition for Cable Communications' services consists primarily of telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks, DTC streaming and other over-the-top ('OTT') service providers and direct broadcast satellite ('DBS') providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours.\n\n## Residential\n\n## Broadband\n\nCable Communications competes with a number of companies offering internet services, including:\n\n- wireline telecommunications companies\n- wireless telecommunications companies\n- municipal broadband networks and power companies\n- satellite broadband providers\n\nCertain wireline telecommunications companies such as AT&amp;T, Frontier, Lumen and Verizon have built and are continuing to build fiber-based network infrastructure farther into their networks, which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those  that  can  be  provided  with  traditional  DSL  technology,  and  are  offering  services  with  these  higher  speeds  in  many  of  our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our broadband services.\n\nCertain companies have launched fiber-to-the-home networks that provide broadband services in certain areas in which we operate, and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiber-based networks.\n\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of technologies, including 4G and 5G, wireless broadband and  Wi-Fi  networks.  These  networks  work  with  devices  such  as  smartphones,  laptops,  tablets,  and  mobile  and  fixed  wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. Moreover, broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying  new  subsidized  internet  access  networks  within  our  footprint.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nInvestments in partnerships, joint ventures and less than majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). The transaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Video Business, with DIRECTV being accounted for under the equity method beginning August 1, 2021.\n\nIn May 2020, we acquired the remaining interest in HBO LAG and fully consolidated that entity. In October 2020, we sold our ownership interest in CME. (See Note 6)\n\nIn 2019, we sold our investments in Hudson Yards and Hulu. (See Note 6)\n\nOur investments in equity affiliates at December 31, 2021 primarily included our interests in DIRECTV, SKY Mexico and The CW Network.\n\nDIRECTV We account for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting. DIRECTV is considered a variable interest entity for accounting purposes. As DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&amp;T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO, we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of DIRECTV.\n\nThe ownership interests in DIRECTV, based on seniority are as follows:\n\n- Preferred units with distribution rights of $1,800 held by TPG, which were fully distributed by December 31, 2021.\n- Junior preferred units with distribution rights of $4,250 held by AT&amp;T, of which $3,212 of distribution rights remain as of December 31, 2021.\n- Distribution preference associated with Common units of $4,200 held by AT&amp;T.\n- Common units, with 70% held by AT&amp;T and 30% held by TPG.\n\nThe initial fair value of the equity considerations on July 31, 2021 was $6,852, which was determined using a discounted cash flow model reflecting distribution rights and preference of the individual instruments. During 2021, we recognized $619 of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $1,942 from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV at December 31, 2021 was $5,539.\n\nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive non-proportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests.\n\nSKY Mexico We hold a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, which is a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe CW Network (The CW) We hold a 50.0% interest in The CW, which is an advertising supported broadcasting and licensing joint venture between Warner Bros. and CBS Corporation.",

      "answer": "CMCSA offers wireless services using MVNO rights over Verizon's network, which means it does not hold its own spectrum licenses and depends on Verizon's compliance with FCC regulations. In contrast, AT&T operates as a facilities-based provider that must directly seek renewal of its FCC-issued wireless licenses, which are critical to its ability to provide services. If the FCC were to introduce more stringent spectrum usage requirements or reduce the availability of spectrum, AT&T would face direct regulatory risk and potentially higher compliance costs. CMCSA, while shielded from direct license renewal risk, could still be indirectly affected if Verizon faces constraints or chooses to renegotiate MVNO terms. This dynamic could lead to divergent investment strategies: AT&T may need to allocate more capital toward spectrum bids and compliance, while CMCSA might focus on expanding its MVNO footprint or bundling with broadband services.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CMCSA's filing - CMCSA offers wireless services using MVNO rights over Verizon's network, not its own licensed spectrum.",

The FCC's rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high-quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fix ed time period, typically 10 to 15 years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers' prices and service offerings have historically not been subject to prescriptive regulation, the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services.\n\nThe Communications Act of 1934 and other related laws give the FCC broad authority to regulate the U.S. operations of our interstate telecommunications services. In addition, our ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.\n\nWe continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize and/or moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further ex tended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.\n\nOur subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided.",

      "answer": "CMCSA offers wireless services to small businesses as part of its Business Services Connectivity segment, which includes services similar to those provided to residential customers, such as wireless backup connectivity and advanced Wi-Fi solutions. However, FCC licensing requirements, as outlined in T's 10-K, mandate that facilities-based wireless providers must obtain and periodically renew licenses for spectrum usage. These licenses are limited in geographic scope and duration (typically 10\u201315 years), and the FCC has the authority to deny renewal if it is not in the public interest. This creates a regulatory dependency for CMCSA, as expansion of its wireless services would require access to licensed spectrum, which may be constrained due to FCC rules and the competitive demand for spectrum from other providers like T. Therefore, CMCSA's ability to scale its wireless business services is directly limited by the availability and renewal of FCC spectrum licenses.",

      "answer": "CMCSA experienced an increase in business services connectivity revenue, which includes wireless services for small businesses and enterprise solutions in the U.S. and U.K., due to higher enterprise solutions revenue and increased rates from small business customers. Meanwhile, AT&T (T) noted that FCC regulations and limited spectrum availability could constrain its ability to deliver high-quality wireless services. This regulatory challenge may create a competitive opportunity for CMCSA, assuming it has better access to spectrum or faces fewer constraints. CMCSA\u2019s own reported revenue growth in this segment suggests that it is already capitalizing on demand for enterprise and small business wireless services, which could allow it to gain market share if AT&T\u2019s service quality is compromised by spectrum limitations.",

This shift is accompanied by investments in SDN and NFV to enhance digital agility. In contrast, Comcast focuses on delivering broadband services to small business locations in the U.S., with increasing revenue attributed to enterprise solutions and higher small business rates. Comcast's costs increased due to direct product costs, marketing, and technical support expenses.

According to Google's 10-K, content acquisition costs for YouTube and Google Play are based on revenues generated or flat fees paid to content providers. If Disney is compelled to reduce its fees or change its bundling practices, this could lower Google's content acquisition costs under 'other cost of revenues,' which include such licensing fees.

      "answer": "The Walt Disney Company had $8.3 billion in notional amounts of foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2023. Google estimated that a 10% adverse foreign currency exchange rate change would have resulted in a $503 million adverse effect on income before income taxes as of December 31, 2023. Both companies hedge foreign exchange risk using forward and option contracts, with DIS specifically hedging the British pound among other currencies to protect forecasted foreign currency transactions, and GOOGL including the British pound among its principal currencies hedged to offset the effect of exchange rate movements on earnings.",

Verizon amortizes deferred contract costs (including costs to obtain and fulfill customer contracts) over a period of two to seven years, depending on the nature of the contract and customer relationship.

Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\n\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowances\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical ex perience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable were not material.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment, including finance leases, are depreciated and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to internal and external sales personnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts. We only defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are incremental costs that would not have been incurred absent the customer contract and are expected to be recoverable. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain wireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business customers' estimated upgrade cycles, as such costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period for our Consumer customers. Incremental costs to obtain wireline contracts for our Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.\n\nWe also defer costs incurred to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance obligation under the contract; and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our performance obligations and recorded in Cost of services. These costs principally relate to direct costs that enhance our wireline business resources, such as costs incurred to install circuits.\n\nWe determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the similarities within these customer contract portfolios.\n\nOther costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred.\n\nCollectively , costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred contract costs, and amortized over a two-to-seven year period. Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively.\n\nThe balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "META strategically utilizes resellers as a key distribution channel for its RL products, alongside retailers and its direct-to-consumer platform, Meta.com, to drive consumer and enterprise sales and adoption of products like the Meta Quest portfolio and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Similarly, VZ explicitly highlights the use of resellers as part of its Business Markets and Other distribution strategy, which generated $13.1 billion in 2024, representing 44% of Business's total revenues. While VZ does not quantify the exact portion of revenue directly attributable to resellers, it underscores their role in business solution fulfillment and integrated mobility services.

We  compete  with  companies  providing  connection,  sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies  that  develop  and  deliver  consumer  hardware  and  augmented,  mixed,  and  virtual  reality  products  and  services.  We  also  ex pect  to  face  additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies as well as efforts to develop the metaverse.\n\n## Technology\n\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video, VR, and MR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is also provided by third parties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network capacity.\n\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems  against  abuse. Across  all  of  these  efforts,  we  are  making  significant  investments  in AI  initiatives,  including  generative AI,  to,  among  other  things, recommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products.\n\nWe also believe in the power of open source innovation and have released our  Llama models, consisting of state-of-the-art foundation models that are available for researchers and developers to use and build upon. By making our Llama models openly available, we aim to accelerate AI research and development, improve our own products, and to foster collaboration and innovation within the broader tech community.\n\n## Sales and Operations\n\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers. We operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\n\nFor  our  RL  products,  our  sales  and  operations  efforts  utilize  third-party  sales  channels  such  as  retailers,  resellers,  and  our  direct-to-consumer  channel, Meta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and enterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.\n\n## Marketing\n\nHistorically,  our  communities  have  generally  grown  organically  with  people  inviting  their  friends  to  connect  with  them,  supported  by  internal  efforts  to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world.",

      "answer": "Verizon's 2024 10-K highlights that performance issues or delays in the deployment of its 5G network could result in significant costs or a reduction in the anticipated benefits of network enhancements. This is critical because Meta's 2024 10-K states that its ability to deliver high-quality mobile products depends on the performance of mobile networks and technologies it does not control, including 5G. Specifically, Meta notes that if its users face difficulties accessing its products on mobile devices or choose not to use mobile products that support Meta's platforms, this could harm user growth and engagement. Since Meta relies heavily on mobile advertising and targeting capabilities, any degradation in network performance\u2014such as slower speeds or reduced connectivity from Verizon's 5G rollout issues\u2014could impair ad delivery and targeting effectiveness. This would directly impact Meta's monetization and user engagement, as outlined in its risk factors section.",

This creates a direct financial and operational risk for Meta, rooted in Verizon's network performance."

For  ex ample, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target  and  measure  ads  effectively,  while  expanding  their  own  advertising business. In addition, G oogle previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, G oogle's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we  do  not  control,  and  that  we  have  good  relationships  with  handset  manufacturers,  mobile  carriers,  and  browser  developers.  We  may  not  be  successful  in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create  successful  new  products,  both  independently  and  in  conjunction  with  developers  or  other  third  parties.  We  may  introduce  significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For ex ample, we continue to launch new AI features on our products, including support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\n\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term. Our efforts to implement default end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on Facebook and Instagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the Nevada Attorney G eneral is seeking to enjoin our offering of default endto-end encryption on Messenger for all Nevada residents under the age of 18.\n\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance could be harmed.",

      "question": "Considering Google's exposure to specific requirements under the EU AI Act for general purpose AI systems and Verizon's regulatory uncertainties around AI development, how might their compliance strategies and associated financial impacts differ based on the specificity of regulation they face?",
      "answer": "Google faces more specific regulatory exposure under the EU AI Act, which includes defined transparency and compliance obligations for general purpose AI systems and the models on which they are based. This would require Google to implement concrete measures for compliance, likely increasing its operational and development costs significantly as it aligns AI systems with these detailed requirements. In contrast, Verizon references broader regulatory uncertainties around AI without specific obligations like those in the EU AI Act. This lack of specificity suggests Verizon may be at an earlier stage of strategic planning for AI compliance, with less immediate financial impact but greater uncertainty about future costs. As a result, Google\u2019s compliance strategy is likely more advanced and costly in the short term, while Verizon may face longer-term unpredictability in budgeting for compliance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Google explicitly references the EU AI Act and its provisional agreement introducing transparency and compliance requirements for general purpose AI systems and models.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Verizon mentions regulatory focus on AI but does not specify obligations like those in the EU AI Act, indicating broader, less-defined exposure.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The specificity of Google\u2019s regulatory environment under the EU AI Act necessitates concrete compliance strategies and measurable cost implications, whereas Verizon\u2019s more general exposure suggests less immediate financial impact but greater uncertainty in planning."

      "answer": "Disney calculates international Disney+ revenue using a daily average of paid subscribers and allocates revenue based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service, while Meta relies on machine learning models and limited data signals (like IP addresses and device information) to estimate user engagement and ad delivery across its platforms. These differing methodologies affect their ability to accurately assess monetization: Disney's approach provides structured revenue per subscriber but may underrepresent value in wholesale arrangements, whereas Meta's platform-based estimation introduces uncertainty, particularly with encrypted services like WhatsApp, where visibility is limited. This leads to contrasting challenges in evaluating performance on third-party platforms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Disney+ uses a daily average of paid subscribers and allocates revenue based on relative retail or wholesale pricing when distributed via third-party platforms.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Meta uses machine learning models calibrated with user surveys and limited data signals (e.g., IP addresses, device info) to estimate user engagement and ad delivery, particularly across encrypted services like WhatsApp where visibility is limited.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While Disney\u2019s model focuses on structured revenue allocation, Meta\u2019s approach introduces estimation risk due to data limitations. Both rely on third-party platforms but assess engagement and monetization differently, impacting cross-platform financial and operational visibility."

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.\n\n## DTC PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS, KEY DEFINITIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nIn the U.S., Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or as part of various multi-product offerings. Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which was available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering. Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.\n\n## Paid Subscribers\n\nPaid subscribers reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Certain product offerings provide the option for an extra member to be added to an account (extra member add-on). These extra members are not counted as paid subscribers. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to multi-product offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each of the Company's services included in the multi-product offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ services. In Latin America prior to July 2024, if a subscriber had either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribed to Combo+, the subscriber was counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. Subscribers include those who receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements, including those for which the service is available to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.\n\n## International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)\n\nInternational Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\n## Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber\n\nHulu and ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses), premium and feature add-on revenue and extra member add-on revenue but excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN+ multiproduct offering. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.",

As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\n\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\n\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. V iolating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\n\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\n\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by user location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates.

In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRY\n\n## Declines in U.S., global and regional economic conditions adversely affect the profitability of our businesses.\n\nDeclines in economic conditions, such as recessions, other less severe slowdowns in economic activity and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business typically adversely affect demand for our products and services and/or costs to operate our businesses, reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced or resulted in slower growth than expected in, among other things, guest spending at our parks and resorts, purchases of and prices for advertising on our platforms and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and we expect similar impacts as such conditions recur. Recent inflationary conditions increased certain of our costs, including at our parks",

      "answer": "Disney+ reports that subscribers acquired through wholesale arrangements or third-party platforms generally have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than those acquired directly or through their own platforms. This is due to the lower wholesale pricing compared to direct subscriptions. Meanwhile, Meta notes that promoting Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, could reduce overall monetization efficiency. If Meta were to rely more heavily on third-party platforms (similar to Disney+) to acquire users for Reels, this could further compress revenue yields, mirroring the lower revenue dynamics Disney+ experiences through wholesale and third-party channels.",

Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which was available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering. Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.\n\n## Paid Subscribers\n\nPaid subscribers reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Certain product offerings provide the option for an extra member to be added to an account (extra member add-on). These extra members are not counted as paid subscribers. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to multi-product offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each of the Company's services included in the multi-product offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ services. In Latin America prior to July 2024, if a subscriber had either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribed to Combo+, the subscriber was counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber.

The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses), premium and feature add-on revenue and extra member add-on revenue but excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN+ multiproduct offering.

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.

We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

This affects revenue allocation across services like Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu Live TV + SVOD. Meanwhile, Meta struggles with accurately estimating average revenue per person (ARPP) because many users have multiple accounts across its Family products (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), and the company relies on complex algorithms and limited data signals (e.g., IP addresses, device info) to attribute accounts to unique individuals. Both companies face platform-dependent measurement complexities, but Disney's issue centers on revenue dilution from third-party pricing structures, whereas Meta's centers on user identity fragmentation affecting monetization insights.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## LIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA\n\n## Family Metrics\n\nThe numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.\n\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\n\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base that have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\n\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further below, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\n\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy",

      "question": "How does Disney's reliance on third-party content for Disney+ Hotstar's exclusive cricket programming in India and Southeast Asia potentially conflict with Meta's stated challenge of attracting engaging third-party content for its platforms, given both companies operate in the Communication Services sector?",
      "answer": "Disney depends heavily on third-party content for its streaming platforms, including Disney+ Hotstar, which has exclusive streaming rights to cricket programming in India and Southeast Asia. This reliance on third-party content is critical for Disney to maintain subscriber engagement, as evidenced by Disney+ Hotstar\u2019s 36 million paid subscribers as of September 28, 2024. Meanwhile, Meta explicitly lists the inability to attract engaging third-party content as a key risk factor for its business, which could reduce user engagement and platform relevance. Since both companies operate in the Communication Services sector and rely on third-party content to drive user engagement, Disney's success in securing exclusive third-party content (e.g., cricket) could limit the availability or attractiveness of similar content for Meta, thereby exacerbating Meta's stated challenge.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Disney+ Hotstar has exclusive streaming rights to certain cricket programming and serves 36 million paid subscribers as of September 28, 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Meta identifies the inability to attract engaging third-party content as a key risk to user engagement and platform relevance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on third-party content to drive engagement; Disney\u2019s exclusive rights to cricket content may reduce availability for others like Meta, directly impacting Meta\u2019s risk factor."

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\nDisney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu are subscription services that provide video streaming of the Company's general entertainment and family programming and similar programming from third parties. Outside the U.S., Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar also include international sports programming. The services are offered individually or in various bundles, which may include ESPN+ (see Sports segment discussion), to customers directly or through third-party distributors on mobile and internet connected devices. The majority of Direct-to-Consumer revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising.\n\n## Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar\n\nDisney+ is a subscription-based DTC service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming, which are all top-level selections or 'tiles' within the Disney+ interface. In the U.S., subscribers to both Disney+ and Hulu may access certain Hulu programming through a tile on Disney+. Outside the U.S., Disney+ includes a Star branded tile, which features general entertainment programming. In Latin America, Disney+ includes an ESPN branded tile, which features a variety of sports content including live events. The Company plans to launch an ESPN branded tile on Disney+ in the U.S. in early fiscal 2025.\n\nIn certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a standalone service with a variety of general entertainment and family content and live sports programming. At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 123 million.\n\nDisney+ Hotstar is a subscription-based DTC service available in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Programming includes television shows, movies, sports and original series in approx imately 10 languages, in addition to gaming and social features. Disney+ Hotstar has exclusive streaming rights to certain cricket programming.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ Hotstar subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 36 million.\n\nDisney+ and Disney+ Hotstar offer content from the Company's various studios, including library titles, as well as content acquired from third parties.\n\nThe majority of Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar revenue is derived from subscription fees and, to a lesser extent, advertising. The Company offers an adsupported Disney+ service in the U.S., Canada and select Latin American and European markets.\n\n## Hulu\n\nHulu is a domestic subscription-based DTC service with general entertainment content from the Company's various studios as well as content licensed from third parties. Hulu's revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising. Hulu offers subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services with or without advertising in addition to a digital OTT MVPD (Live TV) service. The Live TV service is available with either of Hulu's SVOD services and includes live linear streams of various cable and broadcast networks. In addition, Hulu offers subscriptions to premium services such as Max, Cinemax, Starz and Paramount+ with Showtime, which can be added to the Hulu service. Certain programming from ABC Network, Freeform and FX Channels is also available on the Hulu SVOD service one day after the linear airing on these channels. As of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Hulu subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 52 million.\n\n## Content Sales/Licensing and Other\n\nThe majority of Content Sales/Licensing revenue is derived from TV/VOD, theatrical and home entertainment distribution. In addition, revenue is generated from music distribution, stage plays and post-production services through Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound.\n\nThe Company also publishes National Geographic magazine, which is reported with Content Sales/Licensing.\n\n## TV/VOD Distribution\n\nWe license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services.\n\n## Theatrical Distribution\n\nThe Company licenses full-length live-action and animated films to theaters globally. Cumulatively through September 28, 2024, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies. In some territories, certain films may be ex clusively distributed on our DTC streaming services. During fiscal 2025, we expect to release approximately 15 films.",

      "answer": "CMCSA allocates revenue from bundled services based on stand-alone selling prices, using significant judgment to determine performance obligations and how revenue is distributed across services in a bundle. This suggests a pricing and packaging strategy focused on bundling services at a discounted rate to enhance customer value through cost savings. In contrast, VZ emphasizes the technological foundation of its Fios service\u2014specifically Passive Optical Network (PON) technology\u2014as a strategic asset to meet increasing bandwidth demand driven by new video services, data applications, and IP devices in the home. VZ's approach centers on network efficiency and future-readiness, positioning Fios as a scalable and cost-effective solution. This contrast reveals that CMCSA focuses on bundling to drive customer acquisition and retention, while VZ prioritizes infrastructure investment to support long-term demand and service quality.",

CMCSA provides voice services using VoIP technology and is subject to FCC regulations that include law enforcement assistance requirements. However, the FCC has not yet ruled on whether VoIP services should be classified as an 'information service' or a 'telecommunications service,' leaving CMCSA's regulatory obligations in a state of uncertainty. Meanwhile, VZ offers wireline voice services that are considered 'common carrier' services, which are subject to heightened regulatory oversight, including mandatory compliance with law enforcement assistance rules. As a result, VZ must operate under stricter regulatory constraints compared to CMCSA, whose obligations depend on the eventual classification of VoIP services.",

      "answer": "CMCSA offers residential wireline voice services primarily using interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. In contrast, VZ offers wireline voice services that include both traditional telephone service and VoIP-based services. From a regulatory perspective, VZ's legacy telephone services are classified as 'common carrier' services, which are subject to heightened regulatory oversight regarding rates, terms, and conditions. The FCC has not yet decided on the regulatory classification of VoIP services, but VZ must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements for VoIP. CMCSA\u2019s description does not specify regulatory classifications, focusing instead on the technological delivery method (VoIP).",

        "Step 1: From CMCSA's filing, extract the specific technology used for wireline voice services \u2014 interconnected VoIP.",

      "question": "How do the competitive pressures from regional wireless service providers influence both CMCSA and Verizon's (VZ) strategies in offering bundled services, and what evidence from their 2023 filings indicates this strategic response?",
      "answer": "Both CMCSA and Verizon have responded to competition from regional wireless service providers by offering bundled services that integrate wireless with other connectivity or entertainment products. CMCSA explicitly states that it competes with regional wireless providers by bundling wireless services with residential and business broadband offerings. Similarly, Verizon notes that cable operators like Comcast (CMCSA) are reselling wireless services through strategic relationships and bundling them with their own services, such as broadband and video. This indicates that both companies are leveraging bundling as a competitive strategy to retain and attract customers in response to pressure from regional wireless providers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CMCSA\u2019s 2023 10-K, it is stated that the company competes with regional wireless service providers in the U.S., and one of its strategies involves bundling wireless services with broadband and other offerings to residential and business customers.",
        "Step 2: From Verizon\u2019s 2023 10-K, it is noted that resellers\u2014including cable companies like Comcast (CMCSA)\u2014buy bulk wholesale service and resell it to customers, often bundling it with their own services such as broadband and video, which intensifies competition.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that both companies are responding to the same competitive force (regional wireless providers) by using bundling strategies, with CMCSA offering bundled wireless and broadband, and Verizon facing competition from CMCSA\u2019s resale and bundling strategy."

      "answer": "The Walt Disney Company amortizes capitalized software costs over up to 5 years, while AT&T Inc. amortizes its capitalized software costs over a longer range of 3 to 7 years. This difference indicates that AT&T may expect its internal-use software to remain in service longer on average than Disney, or that AT&T has a more diverse portfolio of software assets with varying useful lives. The broader amortization range for AT&T also suggests a more segmented approach to software lifecycle management compared to Disney\u2019s uniform maximum period of 5 years.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

The increase in the carrying value of the associated long-lived asset is depreciated over the corresponding estimated economic life.\n\nSoftware Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are included in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe amortize our capitalized software costs over a three-year to seven-year period, reflecting the estimated period during which these assets will remain in service.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have the following major classes of intangible assets: goodwill; licenses, which include Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other wireless licenses; customer lists and relationships; and trademarks, trade names and various other finite-lived intangible assets (see Note 9).\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nWireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communications services. While wireless licenses are issued for a fix ed period of time (generally ten years), renewals of domestic wireless licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. We have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our FCC wireless licenses. Cash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in 'Acquisitions, net of cash acquired' in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest is capitalized until the spectrum is ready for its intended use.\n\nWe amortize our wireless licenses in Mexico over their average remaining economic life of 25 years.\n\nWe acquired the rights to the AT&amp;T and other trade names in previous acquisitions, classifying certain of those trade names as indefinite-lived. We have the effective ability to retain these ex clusive rights permanently at a nominal cost.\n\nGoodwill, FCC wireless licenses and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment (see Note 9). The testing is performed on the value as of October 1 each year and compares the book values of the assets to their fair values. Goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit, deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below them, to the fair value using both discounted cash flow as well as market multiple approaches. FCC wireless licenses are tested on an aggregate basis, consistent with our use of the licenses on a national scope, using a discounted cash flow approach. Trade names are tested by comparing their book values to their fair values calculated using a discounted cash flow approach on a presumed royalty rate derived from the revenues related to each brand name.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated economic lives (see Note 9). Customer lists and relationships are amortized using primarily the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization over the period in which those relationships are expected to contribute to our future cash flows. Finitelived trademarks and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method. These assets, along with other long-lived assets, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.\n\nAdvertising Costs We expense advertising costs for products and services or for promoting our corporate image as incurred (see Note 23).\n\nForeign Currency Translation Our foreign subsidiaries and foreign investments generally report their earnings in their local currencies. We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at ex change rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and ex penses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI on our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 14 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.",

      "question": "How does the differing approach to content creators between CMCSA and GOOGL influence their respective revenue streams, particularly in relation to advertising and licensing revenue?",
      "answer": "CMCSA faces competitive pressure from content creators as part of the broader entertainment landscape, which impacts its ability to monetize advertising across its Media and Studios segments. The filing notes that CMCSA competes with 'user-generated content' platforms for audience attention and advertising revenue, and declines in audience ratings can adversely affect advertiser willingness to purchase ads. In contrast, GOOGL directly partners with content creators and integrates them into its platforms like YouTube, generating revenue through advertising solutions (e.g., Performance Max) and subscription services (e.g., YouTube Premium). This partnership model allows GOOGL to monetize content creator output through both performance and brand advertising, as well as through platform fees and subscriptions. As a result, CMCSA's advertising and licensing revenue is more exposed to competitive fragmentation, while GOOGL leverages content creators as a revenue multiplier through its advertising and platform ecosystems.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - CMCSA competes with 'user-generated content' platforms, which affects audience ratings and advertising revenue.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GOOGL partners with content creators and monetizes their output through performance and brand advertising, subscriptions, and platform fees.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - CMCSA's revenue is indirectly impacted by content creators through audience fragmentation, while GOOGL directly monetizes content creators through its advertising and platform services."

      "question": "How does reliance on device manufacturers impact Google and Netflix's ability to maintain or grow revenue in international markets, considering the specific risks each company highlights regarding platform adoption and partner relationships?",
      "answer": "Google faces risks if device manufacturers do not widely adopt its products and services across evolving platforms, which could harm its business, financial condition, and operating results. This is particularly relevant in international markets where Google must navigate diverse technical standards, and where failure to develop products that work well on new devices could limit its ability to capture future business opportunities. For Netflix, reliance on device manufacturers is tied directly to its ability to deliver streaming content globally. Netflix states that it must maintain and grow relationships with partners like TV set-top box providers to ensure its service remains widely accessible. If partners offer competing services more effectively or if Netflix cannot expand its device compatibility, its international growth could be hindered. Both companies therefore face revenue risks in international markets due to their dependence on device manufacturers, though Google\u2019s risk centers on product adoption and technological compatibility, while Netflix\u2019s hinges on maintaining broad partner integration and avoiding platform exclusion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From source A (GOOGL), extract the specific risk related to device manufacturer adoption: 'Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers... could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.'",
        "Step 2: From source B (NFLX), extract the specific dependency on device partners: 'We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices,' and the risk that 'if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships... our service may be adversely impacted.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two perspectives: Both companies depend on device manufacturers to access users internationally, but the nature of the risk differs\u2014Google focuses on product compatibility and innovation, while Netflix focuses on partnership continuity and platform availability.",
        "Step 4: Link the dependency to financial impact: Since both companies highlight that failure in this area could harm operating results or growth, it's clear that device manufacturer relationships are critical to revenue potential in international markets."

Although we hedge a portion  of  our  international  currency  exposure,  significant  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  between  the  U.S.  dollar  and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to our Industry\n\nPeople  access  the  Internet  through  a  variety  of  platforms  and  devices  that  continue  to  evolve  with  the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\n\nPeople  access  the  Internet  through  a  growing  variety  of  devices  such  as  desktop  computers,  mobile  phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and televisionstreaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges  we  may  encounter  in  adapting  our  products  and  services  and  developing  competitive  new  products  and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors,  developers,  and  users,  or  failing  to  develop  products  and  technologies  that  work  well  on  new  devices  and platforms,  could  harm  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results  and  ability  to  capture  future  business opportunities.\n\nData  privacy  and  security  concerns  relating  to  our  technology  and  our  practices  could  damage  our reputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users' and customers' ability to use our products and services, harming our business operations and reputation.\n\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, disclosure, or security  of  personal  information  or  other  data-privacy-related  matters,  even  if  unfounded,  could  harm  our  reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.\n\nOur  products  and  services  involve  the  storage,  handling,  and  transmission  of  proprietary  and  other  sensitive information.  Software  bugs,  theft,  misuse,  defects,  vulnerabilities  in  our  products  and  services,  and  security  breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential  liability,  including  regulatory  fines  and  penalties,  as  well  as  reputational  harm.  Additionally,  our  products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future  discover,  some  errors  in  our  software  code  only  after  we  have  released  the  code.  Systems  and  control  failures, security  breaches,  failure  to  comply  with  our  privacy  policies,  and/or  inadvertent  disclosure  of  user  data  could  result  in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches.\n\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  our  systems  on  a  regular  basis. Cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time.  We  have  seen,  and  will  continue  to  see,  industry-wide  vulnerabilities,  such  as  the  Log4j  vulnerability  reported  in December 2021, which could affect our or other parties' systems.

We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n## If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, as well as scaling our ability to program and produce original content, introducing games on our service. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party 'cloud' computing services. As we scale our content production, including now games, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. Further, we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our corporate culture as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Our business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\n\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management's time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\n## We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series, documentaries and feature films to other platforms and partners over time.

      "question": "How do Alphabet's and Netflix's approaches to domain name management reflect their strategies for protecting brand identity and maintaining competitive advantages in their respective markets?",
      "answer": "Alphabet actively registers U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights to protect its proprietary technology and brand, as stated in its 2022 10-K filing. This comprehensive registration strategy reflects a proactive approach to brand protection and maintaining competitive differentiation globally. In contrast, Netflix emphasizes the importance of domain names like Netflix.com to its brand identity but acknowledges risks if third parties acquire similar domain names that could confuse users and dilute its brand. Netflix also highlights the potential adverse effects on its competitive position if it cannot prevent domain name infringement. Both companies view domain names as critical to brand protection, but Alphabet focuses on proactive registration while Netflix emphasizes the risks of failing to protect its domain assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Alphabet's 2022 10-K, extract the statement that they have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights to protect their brand and proprietary technology.",
        "Step 2: From Netflix's 2022 10-K, extract the statement that they hold various domain names relating to their brand, including Netflix.com, and that failure to protect these could adversely affect their reputation, brand, and ability to attract members.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize by comparing both companies' approaches \u2014 Alphabet's proactive registration strategy versus Netflix's emphasis on the risks of domain name infringement \u2014 to understand how each manages domain names as part of their broader brand and competitive positioning."

We provide a variety of high quality training and support to our managers to build and strengthen their capabilities--ranging from courses for new managers, to learning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\n\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve. More information on Google's approach to diversity can be found in our annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  Alphabet  had  156,500  employees.  We  have  work  councils  and  statutory  employee representation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture  and  listening  to  all  employees.  Supporting  healthy  and  open  dialogue  is  central  to  how  we  work,  and  we communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\n\nWhen necessary, we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not have appropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, content moderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to cover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate special projects.

Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes, our content, and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\n## Risks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyberattacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access.

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

If content providers were to withdraw or increase licensing fees, Google's 'other cost of revenues' would likely rise, directly affecting its cost of revenues. Similarly, Netflix's 2022 10-K explicitly states that if studios or content providers refuse to license streaming content on acceptable terms, Netflix's ability to offer compelling content could be adversely affected, potentially leading to increased costs or content unavailability.

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n- Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n- Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\n\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\n\nThe main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:\n\n- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;\n- depreciation; and\n- professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\n\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain  customer service functions; and\n- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\n\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  in  finance,  human  resources,  information  technology,  legal,  and  other administrative support functions;\n- expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n- professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

      "question": "How does the reliance on content providers differently affect Google's advertising platform strategy and Netflix's original content production costs, given Google's need to attract partners through advertising revenue sharing and Netflix's increased production expenses due to pandemic-related disruptions?",
      "answer": "Google depends on content providers to maintain a robust advertising ecosystem, where the company must attract and retain these partners by demonstrating the value of its advertiser base and the revenue-generating potential of its platform. This shapes Google's strategy to continuously improve ad targeting and delivery across distribution channels. In contrast, Netflix's reliance on content providers is tied to the production and licensing of original programming, which has become more costly due to pandemic-related disruptions, including production delays, safety protocols, and increased labor expenses. These increased costs directly impact Netflix\u2019s financial planning and content strategy, while Google's challenge centers on maintaining competitive differentiation and platform appeal to both advertisers and content creators.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Google competes for content providers based on the quality of its advertiser base and its ability to help partners generate revenues from advertising, which directly influences its platform strategy and ad technology development.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Netflix has seen increased content production costs due to the pandemic, including additional pay for cast and crew, safety protocols, and testing, which have affected its financial results and content release schedules.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies rely on content providers, the nature of that reliance differs: Google focuses on platform attractiveness and ad revenue sharing to secure partnerships, whereas Netflix faces direct cost pressures in content creation that influence its budgeting and production timelines."

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nwith current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\n## The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the various responses to it has disrupted our business, increased our costs, led to delays in content releases and may continue to impact our business and results of operations.\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the various responses to it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The full extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the effect on our members and consumer demand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees' ability to work and travel; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming. Such production pauses have in the past, and may in the future, cause us to delay content releases and temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions can result in additional costs to production, including additional pay to cast and crew. Also, Covid-related delays and production protocols and requirements, including use of PPE and testing, add to costs of production.\n\nWe will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, members, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nIn addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy may continue to be impacted as a result of the actions taken in response to COVID-19. To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers' ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors' ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operations negatively impacted.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we have expanded our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk, which risks have been heightened during Covid-19. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.  We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising",

      "answer": "Disney recorded $187 million in impairment charges for produced content in fiscal 2024, indicating that some of its internally developed content was written down due to reduced expectations of future value. In contrast, Netflix plans to amortize $10,152 million of unamortized produced content over the next three years, with $3,954 million, $2,767 million, and $1,718 million expected to be amortized each respective year. The significant difference in approach suggests that Disney may be more willing to write down underperforming content, while Netflix is systematically amortizing its content investments over time, signaling a more sustained and predictable content monetization strategy.",

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nNetflix , Inc. (the 'Company') was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical ex perience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 22040): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific ex pense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.\n\n## Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , requiring public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments' significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 12 Segment and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Shortterm investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in 'Interest and other income (ex pense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.",

      "question": "How did AT&T's divestiture of Hulu and subsequent WarnerMedia-Discovery transaction affect the competitive landscape for streaming services, and what does Disney's subscriber data reveal about its position in this environment?",
      "answer": "AT&T sold its ownership interest in Hulu for $1,430 million in April 2019 and later completed the tax-free spin-off of WarnerMedia, which merged with Discovery to form a new company in Q2 2022. AT&T shareholders received approximately 0.24 shares of the new company per AT&T share held, consolidating WarnerMedia\u2019s content under a new entity. This reshaped the streaming landscape by combining two major content providers, increasing competitive pressure on other platforms. Meanwhile, Disney's 2022 10-K highlighted a decline in TV/SVOD distribution revenue, partly due to the absence of Disney+ Premier Access revenues that had boosted prior-year results from films like Black Widow and Raya and the Last Dragon. Disney also provided subscriber data for Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu, indicating its continued focus on direct-to-consumer streaming as a core strategy despite market consolidation. The combined WarnerMedia-Discovery entity thus intensified competition, while Disney\u2019s subscriber metrics and Premier Access model reflect its evolving response to shifting viewer preferences and a more concentrated streaming market.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From source B, AT&T sold Hulu in 2019 for $1,430 million and spun off WarnerMedia to merge with Discovery in 2022, creating a new competitive entity in the streaming space.",
        "Step 2: From source A, Disney reported a revenue decline in its TV/SVOD segment, attributing it to the absence of Disney+ Premier Access revenues from major films that had contributed in the prior year.",
        "Step 3: Disney also disclosed subscriber data for Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu in its 2022 10-K, showing its strategic emphasis on streaming despite the broader market changes.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: The WarnerMedia-Discovery merger, following AT&T\u2019s divestiture of Hulu, reshaped the streaming landscape by creating a stronger combined competitor. Disney's subscriber metrics and Premier Access revenue drop illustrate how these market shifts impacted its financials and strategic positioning."

(Discovery). The agreement is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which WarnerMedia will be distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata dividend, an exchange offer, or a combination of both, followed by its combination with Discovery. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T's shareholders. AT&amp;T will receive approximately $43,000 (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&amp;T's shareholders will receive stock representing approximately 71% of the new company; Discovery shareholders will own approximately 29% of the new company.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, we announced that we will structure the distribution as a spin-off rather than an exchange offer. Upon closing of the transaction, each AT&amp;T shareholder will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of the new company for each share of AT&amp;T common stock held as of the record date for the pro rata distribution. The exact number of shares to be received by AT&amp;T shareholders for each AT&amp;T common share will be determined closer to the closing based on the number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as-converted and as-exercised basis. AT&amp;T shareholders will continue to hold the same number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock after the transaction closes.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. No vote is required by AT&amp;T shareholders. Upon close of the transaction, WarnerMedia will be deconsolidated.\n\nThe merger agreement contains certain customary termination rights for AT&amp;T and Discovery, including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate if the transaction is not completed on or before July 15, 2023. Termination fees under specified circumstances will require Discovery to pay AT&amp;T $720 or AT&amp;T to pay Discovery $1,770.\n\nMagallanes, Inc.

(Discovery). The agreement is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which WarnerMedia will be distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata dividend, an exchange offer, or a combination of both, followed by its combination with Discovery. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T's shareholders. AT&amp;T will receive approximately $43,000 (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&amp;T's shareholders will receive stock representing approximately 71% of the new company; Discovery shareholders will own approximately 29% of the new company.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, we announced that we will structure the distribution as a spin-off rather than an exchange offer. Upon closing of the transaction, each AT&amp;T shareholder will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of the new company for each share of AT&amp;T common stock held as of the record date for the pro rata distribution. The exact number of shares to be received by AT&amp;T shareholders for each AT&amp;T common share will be determined closer to the closing based on the number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as-converted and as-exercised basis. AT&amp;T shareholders will continue to hold the same number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock after the transaction closes.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. No vote is required by AT&amp;T shareholders. Upon close of the transaction, WarnerMedia will be deconsolidated.\n\nThe merger agreement contains certain customary termination rights for AT&amp;T and Discovery, including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate if the transaction is not completed on or before July 15, 2023. Termination fees under specified circumstances will require Discovery to pay AT&amp;T $720 or AT&amp;T to pay Discovery $1,770.\n\nMagallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, entered into a $41,500 commitment letter (Bridge Loan) on May 17, 2021. On June 4, 2021, Spinco entered into a $10,000 term loan credit agreement (Spinco Term Loan) and reduced the aggregate commitment amount under the Bridge Loan to $31,500. There have been no draws on the Bridge Loan or the Spinco Term Loan. In the event advances are made under the Bridge Loan or Spinco Term Loan, those advances will be used by Spinco to finance a portion of the cash distribution to AT&amp;T in connection with the transaction.\n\nXandr On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr, primarily representing the AppNexus business, to Microsoft, which is expected to close in 2022, subject to customary regulatory approvals. This advertising business is included in our WarnerMedia segment and is excluded from the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. We applied held-for-sale accounting treatment to the related assets and liabilities of this business, resulting in approximately $550 of goodwill and other intangible assets being reclassified to 'Prepaid and other current assets' as of December 31, 2021.",

      "answer": "Google discloses that it has dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including worldwide incident response teams, to address issues like spamming, scraping, and spreading disinformation. Meta similarly highlights its ongoing efforts to combat undesirable activity on its platform, including spamming, through increased security measures and platform integrity initiatives. Both companies emphasize the evolving nature of these threats, the difficulty in detecting and preventing them, and the potential for reputational, legal, and financial harm. These disclosures reflect the substantial operational complexity and investment required to manage spamming and platform misuse at scale for large technology firms.",

      "answer": "META has $16.49 billion in non-cancelable commitments tied to consumer hardware investments in Reality Labs, which represents a substantial financial exposure. Meanwhile, GOOGL explicitly identifies risks associated with its investments in devices such as smartphones, home devices, and wearables, noting that margins on these products have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on its consolidated margins due to pricing pressures and higher cost of sales. Both companies are investing heavily in consumer hardware, a market characterized by intense competition, short product life cycles, and pricing sensitivity. Given GOOGL\u2019s acknowledgment of margin compression risks from its hardware investments, META\u2019s large fixed commitments could similarly expose it to downward pressure on operating margins, especially if product adoption or pricing does not meet expectations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - META has $16.49 billion in non-cancelable commitments related to consumer hardware in Reality Labs.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are investing heavily in consumer hardware, a market with inherent risks such as intense competition and pricing sensitivity. GOOGL's risk disclosures suggest that META's $16.49 billion in commitments could expose it to similar margin pressures if product performance or market conditions fall short."

      "answer": "Google's AI development increases its exposure to nation-state cyber attacks due to the complexity and novelty of its technologies, which introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Google explicitly states that its efforts to address undesirable activity on its platform increase the risk of retaliatory attacks, and it expects to continue expending significant resources to maintain security protections. Similarly, Meta's payments infrastructure makes it an attractive target for nation-state and state-sponsored actors due to the sensitive financial data it handles and its prominence in the industry. Meta notes that geopolitical events heighten these risks and that it also faces increased threats as a result of its platform integrity efforts. Both companies highlight the financial burden of cybersecurity, with Google committing significant resources to security protections and Meta facing potential monetary fines, operational restrictions, and increased compliance costs due to regulatory scrutiny related to payments and data breaches.",

      "question": "Based on their 2023 10-K filings, how might scraping risks differently affect Google's advertising business compared to Meta's platform integrity, particularly in light of their disclosed vulnerabilities?",
      "answer": "Both Google and Meta identify scraping as a material risk factor in their 2023 10-K filings, but the potential impacts differ based on their core business models and mitigation disclosures. Google highlights that scraping incidents could lead to unauthorized access to user data, misuse of systems, and activities inconsistent with its terms or policies, which could harm user trust, engagement, and result in significant legal and financial risks. This poses a direct threat to Google's advertising business, as reduced user trust and engagement could lead to decreased ad effectiveness and advertiser demand. Meta similarly identifies scraping as a significant threat, noting its susceptibility due to the prominence of its platforms, the size of its user base, and the volume of personal data stored. Meta's concern centers around platform integrity and user trust, as scraping could facilitate spamming, spreading disinformation, and other undesirable activities that degrade the user experience. This, in turn, could diminish advertiser confidence and harm Meta\u2019s financial performance. Given that both companies face similar threats, the distinction lies in how these risks could manifest\u2014Google's advertising revenue could suffer from reduced user engagement, while Meta's platform integrity could erode due to harmful content proliferation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Google explicitly mentions scraping as a risk factor, noting that such incidents could harm user trust, engagement, and lead to legal and financial risks.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Meta identifies scraping as a threat to platform integrity, with risks including spamming, spreading disinformation, and other undesirable activities that degrade user experience.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies face scraping-related risks, the potential business impacts differ: Google's advertising business could suffer from reduced user engagement, whereas Meta's platform integrity could be compromised, affecting advertiser confidence."

      "question": "Considering the foreign currency translation policies applied to their international subsidiaries and the cumulative translation losses reported, how does the difference in the magnitude of these losses between META and GOOGL reflect the relative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on their respective stockholders' equity?",
      "answer": "META reported cumulative translation losses, net of tax, of $1.24 billion as of December 31, 2023, while GOOGL also applies similar foreign currency translation policies but did not disclose a specific cumulative loss figure. This indicates that exchange rate fluctuations have a quantifiably larger negative impact on META\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity compared to GOOGL, assuming GOOGL\u2019s translation losses are smaller or less significant relative to its equity base. The difference in reported losses suggests that META\u2019s international operations are either more exposed to depreciating currencies or have experienced more significant movements in the relevant exchange rates affecting their translated financial statements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GOOGL translates international subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average rates for revenues and expenses, with translation gains and losses recorded in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - META reported cumulative translation losses, net of tax, of $1.24 billion as of December 31, 2023, also using month-end and average exchange rates for translation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies apply the same accounting policy for foreign currency translation, yet META explicitly quantifies its cumulative losses, indicating a measurable impact on equity. GOOGL\u2019s lack of a specific loss figure implies either smaller losses or less emphasis on their significance, suggesting a relatively lower impact on equity.",
        "Step 4: Calculate/Compare - The $1.24 billion translation loss for META provides a concrete figure to compare against GOOGL\u2019s unspecified but presumably smaller loss, highlighting the differential impact of exchange rate fluctuations on their respective stockholders\u2019 equity."

      "question": "How does the increase in NFLX's content amortization and production costs relate to CMCSA's concerns about content licensing and its impact on Peacock's growth strategy?",
      "answer": "NFLX experienced a $171 million increase in content amortization and a $376 million rise in content-related costs in 2023, reflecting the growing financial pressure on streaming platforms to secure and produce content. This aligns with CMCSA's concern that content creators, including those that license to Peacock, are increasingly launching their own DTC platforms, reducing the availability of high-quality licensed content. As a result, CMCSA faces challenges in maintaining a competitive content library for Peacock, which is crucial for user growth and retention. The rising costs for content on platforms like NFLX highlight the broader industry trend where companies must either pay more for licensed content or invest heavily in original productions, directly impacting CMCSA's ability to grow Peacock profitably.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA expresses concern over content owners launching their own DTC platforms (e.g., Peacock), reducing the availability and quality of licensed content for traditional networks and potentially affecting Peacock\u2019s growth.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NFLX reports a $171 million increase in content amortization and a $376 million increase in content acquisition and production costs in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The rising costs for NFLX reflect the broader industry challenge of expensive content licensing and production, which directly ties to CMCSA's concern that content owners are moving away from third-party licensing and toward exclusive DTC platforms. This limits CMCSA\u2019s ability to secure strong content for Peacock, increasing its need to invest more in original content, mirroring NFLX's spending trend."

      "answer": "The combined expected amortization of produced content for Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) over the next three years is $19,434 million. For DIS, the amortization of produced content over the next three years is $10,454 million in 2024, as reported in their 2023 10-K filing. For NFLX, the expected amortization of produced content over the next three years is $3,766 million in 2024, $2,622 million in 2025, and $1,793 million in 2026, totaling $8,981 million. Adding DIS's 2024 amortization ($10,454 million) to NFLX\u2019s three-year total ($8,981 million) results in $19,434 million in combined amortization for produced content.",

        "Step 3: Add DIS's 2024 amortization of produced content ($10,454 million) to NFLX\u2019s three-year amortization total ($8,981 million) to calculate the combined amortization of produced content: $10,454 + $8,981 = $19,434 million."

      "question": "How do the differing approaches to content-related investment obligations under international regulations, as described in the 10-K filings of Disney and Netflix, affect their respective content licensing and production strategies in international markets?",
      "answer": "Disney notes that international content regulations may require compliance with investment obligations or quotas, which can restrict how content is licensed and distributed globally, particularly affecting their international theme parks and resorts in France, mainland China, and Hong Kong. Netflix specifically states that certain countries are updating cultural support legislation to include services like theirs, imposing content quotas, levies, and investment obligations that may restrict ownership rights and content offerings. These regulatory pressures shape their strategies differently: Disney must navigate a complex global regulatory environment that could limit its operational flexibility and profitability abroad, while Netflix is adapting by modifying its content offerings and possibly increasing local production investments to meet regional requirements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (Disney) - Disney is subject to international content regulations that include investment obligations or quotas, which affect how content is licensed and distributed, and these regulations may restrict its ability to operate profitably, especially in international markets like France, mainland China, and Hong Kong.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (Netflix) - Netflix is encountering updated cultural support legislation in certain countries that impose content quotas, levies, and investment obligations, restricting ownership rights and content offerings on its platform.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Disney and Netflix face similar international regulatory pressures related to investment obligations, but they are responding differently based on their business models and geographic exposure. Disney's international theme park operations are directly affected by these regulations, while Netflix is adjusting its content licensing and production strategies to comply with local laws."

      "question": "How do the regulatory requirements related to investment obligations in the European Union impact both Disney's and Netflix's international content strategies, and what specific percentage requirement under the Audio Visual Media Services Directive influences these strategies?",
      "answer": "Both Disney and Netflix are impacted by the European Union's Audio Visual Media Services Directive, which requires that European works comprise at least 30% of media service providers' catalogs. This specific regulatory requirement shapes their international content strategies by necessitating increased investment in European content production and prominence. For Disney, this affects their international broadcasting and content licensing operations, while for Netflix, it directly influences catalog composition and local content investment obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Disney is subject to international content regulation, including investment obligations, which affect their broadcasting and content licensing operations in Europe.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Netflix specifically mentions the European Union's Audio Visual Media Services Directive revised in 2018, requiring European works to comprise at least 30% of media service providers' catalogs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies must adjust their content strategies to meet the 30% European content requirement, which represents a specific investment obligation impacting their international operations in the EU."

      "question": "Alphabet (GOOGL) mentions facing patent claims that could lead to injunctions limiting product offerings, while AT&T (T) highlights risks from patent litigation influencing its wireless and video content delivery strategies. Given these specific litigation exposures, how might both companies adjust their R&D investments in proprietary technologies to mitigate reliance on contested intellectual property, and what financial impact could this have on their innovation pipelines?",
      "answer": "Alphabet faces patent claims that could result in injunctions limiting its ability to offer certain features or products, which may require costly redesigns or licensing agreements. AT&T, on the other hand, faces patent litigation risks that could impact its ability to deliver wireless and video content offerings, particularly as it competes on speed and service innovation. Both companies may respond by increasing R&D investments in proprietary technologies to reduce reliance on contested IP. This would likely lead to higher operating expenses and delayed product launches, as seen in Alphabet\u2019s acknowledgment of the costs associated with redesigning non-infringing technologies and AT&T\u2019s emphasis on the importance of developing unique offerings to maintain competitive differentiation. The financial impact could include reduced near-term profitability and longer development cycles for new services.",

In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and carries the potential of service interruptions in those countries.\n\n## We face, and may continue to face, intellectual  property  and  other  claims  that  could  be  costly  to  defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\n\nWe, like other internet, technology and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate  income  from  patents  they  have  obtained  by  bringing  claims  against  us.  As  we  have  grown,  the  number  of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.\n\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Other parties have also sought broad  injunctive  relief  against  us  by  filing  claims  in  U.S.  and  international  courts  and  the  U.S.  International  Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty  or  licensing  agreements  (if  licenses  are  available  at  all),  or  orders  preventing  us  from  offering  certain  features, functionalities, products, or services. They may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services, or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\n\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims  and  in  some  cases  indemnify  them  for  certain  intellectual  property infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there  were  an  adverse  ruling  in  any  such  claims.  Such  customers  and  partners  may  also  discontinue  the  use  of  our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims.  Furthermore,  in  connection  with  our  divestitures,  we  have  agreed,  and  may  in  the  future  agree,  to  provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities,  including  those  associated  with  intellectual  property  claims.  Regardless  of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims  are  successful,  they  may  harm  our  business,  including  our  product  and  service  offerings,  financial  condition,  or operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance longterm  stockholder  value,  and  share  repurchases  could  increase  the  volatility  of  our  stock  prices  and  could diminish our cash reserves.\n\nWe  engage  in  share  repurchases  of  our  Class  A  and  Class  C  stock  from  time  to  time  in  accordance  with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\n\n## The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.\n\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no voting  rights.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  Larry  Page  and  Sergey  Brin  beneficially  owned  approximately  85.9%  of  our outstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.4% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey's current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.

We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\nThe following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements:\n\n- The severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment, mitigation and other measures taken in response, including the potential impacts of these matters on our business and operations.\n- Our inability to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts will continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\n- Adverse economic, political and/or capital access changes in the markets served by us or in countries in which we have significant investments and/or operations, including the impact on customer demand and our ability and our suppliers' ability to access financial markets at favorable rates and terms.\n- Increases in our benefit plans' costs, including increases due to adverse changes in the United States and foreign securities markets, resulting in worse-than-assumed investment returns and discount rates; adverse changes in mortality assumptions; adverse medical cost trends; and unfavorable or delayed implementation or repeal of healthcare legislation, regulations or related court decisions.\n- The final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings (including judicial review, if any, of such proceedings) and legislative efforts involving issues that are important to our business, including, without limitation, pending Notices of Apparent Liability; the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, including the withdrawal of legacy TDM-based services; universal service; broadband deployment; wireless equipment siting regulations and, in particular, siting for 5G service; E911 services; competition policy; privacy; net neutrality; multichannel video programming distributor services and equipment; content licensing and copyright protection; availability of new spectrum on fair and balanced terms;

the extent to which regulatory and build-out requirements apply to our offerings; our ability to match speeds offered by our competitors and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings.\n- Our ability to generate subscription and advertising revenue from attractive video content, especially from WarnerMedia, in the face of unpredictable and rapidly evolving public viewing habits and legal restrictions on using personal data for advertising.\n- The availability and cost and our ability to adequately fund additional wireless spectrum and network upgrades;

      "answer": "AT&T received $1,430 million (or $1.43 billion) from the sale of its ownership interest in Hulu in April 2019. This transaction aligns with AT&T's broader strategy of divesting media assets, which was further exemplified by the subsequent announcement in February 2022 of the WarnerMedia spin-off and merger with Discovery.

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

(Discovery). The agreement is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which WarnerMedia will be distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata dividend, an exchange offer, or a combination of both, followed by its combination with Discovery. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T's shareholders. AT&amp;T will receive approximately $43,000 (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&amp;T's shareholders will receive stock representing approximately 71% of the new company; Discovery shareholders will own approximately 29% of the new company.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, we announced that we will structure the distribution as a spin-off rather than an exchange offer. Upon closing of the transaction, each AT&amp;T shareholder will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of the new company for each share of AT&amp;T common stock held as of the record date for the pro rata distribution. The exact number of shares to be received by AT&amp;T shareholders for each AT&amp;T common share will be determined closer to the closing based on the number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as-converted and as-exercised basis. AT&amp;T shareholders will continue to hold the same number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock after the transaction closes.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. No vote is required by AT&amp;T shareholders. Upon close of the transaction, WarnerMedia will be deconsolidated.\n\nThe merger agreement contains certain customary termination rights for AT&amp;T and Discovery, including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate if the transaction is not completed on or before July 15, 2023. Termination fees under specified circumstances will require Discovery to pay AT&amp;T $720 or AT&amp;T to pay Discovery $1,770.\n\nMagallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, entered into a $41,500 commitment letter (Bridge Loan) on May 17, 2021. On June 4, 2021, Spinco entered into a $10,000 term loan credit agreement (Spinco Term Loan) and reduced the aggregate commitment amount under the Bridge Loan to $31,500. There have been no draws on the Bridge Loan or the Spinco Term Loan. In the event advances are made under the Bridge Loan or Spinco Term Loan, those advances will be used by Spinco to finance a portion of the cash distribution to AT&amp;T in connection with the transaction.\n\nXandr On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr, primarily representing the AppNexus business, to Microsoft, which is expected to close in 2022, subject to customary regulatory approvals. This advertising business is included in our WarnerMedia segment and is excluded from the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. We applied held-for-sale accounting treatment to the related assets and liabilities of this business, resulting in approximately $550 of goodwill and other intangible assets being reclassified to 'Prepaid and other current assets' as of December 31, 2021.",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 10. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nInvestments in partnerships, joint ventures and less than majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). The transaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Video Business, with DIRECTV being accounted for under the equity method beginning August 1, 2021.\n\nIn May 2020, we acquired the remaining interest in HBO LAG and fully consolidated that entity. In October 2020, we sold our ownership interest in CME. (See Note 6)\n\nIn 2019, we sold our investments in Hudson Yards and Hulu. (See Note 6)\n\nOur investments in equity affiliates at December 31, 2021 primarily included our interests in DIRECTV, SKY Mexico and The CW Network.\n\nDIRECTV We account for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting. DIRECTV is considered a variable interest entity for accounting purposes. As DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&amp;T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO, we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of DIRECTV.\n\nThe ownership interests in DIRECTV, based on seniority are as follows:\n\n- Preferred units with distribution rights of $1,800 held by TPG, which were fully distributed by December 31, 2021.\n- Junior preferred units with distribution rights of $4,250 held by AT&amp;T, of which $3,212 of distribution rights remain as of December 31, 2021.\n- Distribution preference associated with Common units of $4,200 held by AT&amp;T.\n- Common units, with 70% held by AT&amp;T and 30% held by TPG.\n\nThe initial fair value of the equity considerations on July 31, 2021 was $6,852, which was determined using a discounted cash flow model reflecting distribution rights and preference of the individual instruments. During 2021, we recognized $619 of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $1,942 from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV at December 31, 2021 was $5,539.\n\nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive non-proportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests.\n\nSKY Mexico We hold a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, which is a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe CW Network (The CW) We hold a 50.0% interest in The CW, which is an advertising supported broadcasting and licensing joint venture between Warner Bros. and CBS Corporation.",

      "question": "How does Google's reliance on unimpeded internet access, particularly from incumbent providers like telephone companies, intersect with Verizon's market position and service offerings, given that Verizon reported $14.2 billion in Enterprise and Public Sector revenues in 2024?",
      "answer": "Google explicitly states in its 2024 10-K filing that its business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet, and that access is often provided by companies with significant market power, including incumbent telephone companies. Verizon, as a major incumbent telephone company, offers a variety of internet access services through its fiber-optic and wireless networks, including FWA broadband with nearly 4.6 million connections as of December 31, 2024. Verizon\u2019s Enterprise and Public Sector segment, which includes internet access services among its offerings, generated $14.2 billion in revenue in 2024, highlighting its substantial influence in the broadband and connectivity market. This market power positions Verizon as a key player in the internet access ecosystem that Google relies upon, and any actions by Verizon\u2014such as restricting or degrading access\u2014could directly impact Google\u2019s ability to deliver its services, affecting its financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Google's 2024 10-K filing highlights its dependency on internet access and mentions that access is often provided by companies with significant market power, including incumbent telephone companies.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Verizon's 2024 10-K filing reports nearly 4.6 million FWA broadband connections and $14.2 billion in Enterprise and Public Sector revenues, which includes internet access services.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Verizon, as a major incumbent telephone company, directly intersects with Google\u2019s stated dependency on unimpeded internet access. The scale of Verizon\u2019s broadband offerings and its reported revenue from enterprise services confirm its market power, reinforcing the potential for Verizon\u2019s actions to impact Google\u2019s business."

While we inv est significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relev ant results and to detect and prev ent low-quality content and inv alid  traffic,  we  hav e  been  unable  and  may  continue to be unable to detect and prev ent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new av enues of abuse for bad actors.\n\nMany websites violate or attempt to v iolate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relev ance and utility would rank them. Such efforts hav e affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms  and  lead  them  to  display  false,  misleading,  or  undesirable  content. Although  English-language  web  spam  in  our  search  results  has  been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improv e their rankings. Although we continue to inv est in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prev ent web spam on our platforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may hav e negativ e experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect  our  users'  decisions  in  continuing  to  use  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and  irrelev ant  content  websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improv e their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prev ent abuse from low-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including v iolations of our content guidelines inv olv ing incidents such as attempted election interference; activ ities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nIf we fail to either detect and prev ent an increase in problematic content or effectiv ely promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for deliv ering relev ant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and div ert management's time and attention.\n\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\n\nOur products and serv ices depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to  work  effectiv ely.  Currently,  this  access  is  prov ided  by  companies  that  hav e  significant  market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access marketplace,  including  incumbent  telephone  companies,  cable  companies,  mobile  communications  companies,  and  gov ernment-owned  serv ice prov iders. Some of these prov iders hav e taken, or hav e stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  prov ide  our  offerings,  or  by  prov iding  our  competitors  preferential  access.  Some  jurisdictions  hav e  adopted  regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access prov iders; howev er, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and serv ices hav e been subject to gov ernment-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, adv ertisers, and/or content prov iders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negativ ely affecting our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations cov ering a wide v ariety of subjects, and our introduction of  new  businesses,  products,  serv ices,  and  technologies  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  In  recent  years, governments around the world hav e proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relev ant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data priv acy and security, competition, AI, and online content. T he costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations.",

      "question": "How do the distinct sources of personal injury litigation exposure described by Google and Verizon reflect different operational risks in their core businesses, and what does this suggest about the nature of their legal cost structures?",
      "answer": "Google's personal injury litigation exposure stems from its platform-based business model, where it faces claims related to content generated by users and goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their platforms. In contrast, Verizon's personal injury claims are tied to its wireless business, specifically lawsuits alleging adverse health effects from wireless phones and radio frequency transmitters. These distinct sources of litigation reflect fundamental differences in their operational risks: Google's exposure is rooted in digital content and third-party activity on its platforms, while Verizon's arises from the physical products and infrastructure of its telecommunications services. This divergence suggests that Google's legal cost structure likely includes significant expenses related to content moderation, advertiser vetting, and platform governance, whereas Verizon's legal costs are more likely associated with product liability defenses and regulatory scrutiny of wireless device safety. Both companies acknowledge the potential for substantial legal expenses and adverse judgments, indicating that litigation risk is a material component of their respective cost frameworks.",

In particular, the California Consumer Privacy A ct, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and a number of other privacy laws more recently adopted by  other  states  and  countries  include  significant  penalties  for  non-compliance.  Generally ,  attention  to  priv acy   and  data  security   requirements  is increasing at all levels of government globally , and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.\n- Regulation of broadband internet access services - V eriz on offers many different broadband services. In early January 2025, based on litigation filed by the broadband industry , a federal appeals court overturned the FCC's A pril 2024 final decision to regulate broadband services via utility-style common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications A ct. A bsent further action in the courts, this decision will remain in effect and limit the risk of burdensome FCC broadband regulation. In addition to federal activity , several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our broadband services, including a law in New Y ork that requires discounted broadband pricing for low income customers. Some states may also impose pricing or other rules related to broadband built with the assistance of federal or state funding. The FCC also adopted broad rules related to \"digital discrimination\" that could further increase regulatory oversight of broadband services; industry groups have appealed those rules in court.\n- \"Open access\" - We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. M oreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.\n- Climate-related  regulation  and  policy -  Due  to  the  nature  of  our  operations,  we  hav e  been,  and  ex pect  to  continue  to  be  impacted  by   regulatory developments related to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-driven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels.\n\nThese developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.\n\n## Our business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, or their interpretations, and challenges to our tax positions.\n\nTax laws and regulations are complex, dynamic, and subject to change and varying interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services. In addition, tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate, tax  liabilities, and the carry ing v alue of deferred tax  assets or deferred tax  liabilities. A ny  of these changes could materially  impact our financial performance and our tax provision, net income and cash flows.\n\nWe are also subject to ongoing audits, examinations and other tax controversies in various jurisdictions. A lthough we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these controversies to determine the adequacy of provisions for taxes, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. In the event that we have not accurately or fully described, disclosed or determined, calculated or remitted amounts that were due to taxing authorities or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, we could be subject to additional taxes, penalties and interest, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.\n\nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation and claims in arbitration, including, but not limited to, shareholder lawsuits, patent and copyright infringement lawsuits, wage and hour class actions, contract and commercial claims, personal injury claims, property claims, environmental claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. W e may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards of damages or settlements. We also could be subject to court-ordered injunctions and other remedies that could negatively impact our business operations. Our wireless business is also subject to lawsuits relating to alleged adverse health effects of wireless phones and radio frequency transmitters. A ny of these allegations or changes in government agencies' assessment of the risks associated with using wireless devices could result in significant legal and regulatory liability  and other remedies, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.",

In contrast, Alphabet's 2022 10-K reveals that Class A stock participates in dividends and liquidation rights identically to Class B and Class C shares, with dividend distributions requiring uniformity across all classes due to contractual protections in the certificate of incorporation and Delaware law. This means that while Comcast's Class A stock is a significant component of its equity with specific issued and outstanding figures, Alphabet's Class A stock is bound by structural safeguards ensuring equal treatment in dividend and liquidation outcomes, making the shareholder rights and equity dynamics fundamentally different between the two companies.",

Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\n\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical,  except  with  respect  to  voting.  Furthermore,  there  are  a  number  of  safeguards  built  into  our  certificate  of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends  on  our  Class  A,  Class  B,  and  Class  C  stock.  Specifically,  Delaware  law  provides  that  amendments  to  our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that  before  any  such  amendment  may  be  put  to  a  stockholder  vote,  it  must  be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\n\n",

      "question": "How do the data security requirements under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) specifically affect CMCSA's cable services and GOOGL's online platforms, based on the obligations described in their respective 2022 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "CMCSA is subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements under COPPA that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from such children. These obligations directly impact how CMCSA manages data collected through its cable and online services aimed at younger audiences. Similarly, GOOGL is also subject to COPPA in the U.S., which governs the ability of online services to collect information from minors, affecting how Google handles data collected from users under 13 on platforms like YouTube. Both companies must ensure compliance with COPPA\u2019s data handling rules, but the obligations are applied differently based on their business models\u2014CMCSA through its cable and content delivery infrastructure, and GOOGL through its digital platforms and advertising ecosystem.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CMCSA\u2019s 10-K filing, we extract that they are subject to COPPA-related data security and data retention requirements for services directed to children under 12 or that knowingly collect data from them.",
        "Step 2: From GOOGL\u2019s 10-K filing, we extract that COPPA regulates the collection of information from minors and applies to their online services, particularly affecting platforms like YouTube where underage users may be present.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize how COPPA imposes data handling obligations on both companies, but the application differs\u2014CMCSA through its cable and online content services, and GOOGL through its digital advertising and platform-based services."

          "chunk_text": "## Other Areas of Regulation\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nCopyright,  trademark,  unfair  competition,  patent,  trade  secret  and  other  proprietary-rights  laws  of  the  United  States  and  other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal  protections  exist  to  combat  such  practices,  the  extent  of  copyright  protection  is  sometimes  ambiguous  and  the  use  of technological  protections  can  be  controversial.  Modifications  to  existing  laws,  a  weakening  of  these  protections  or  their enforcement or a failure of existing laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\n\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute.  The  cable  compulsory  copyright  license  and  the  royalties  we  pay  are  subject  to  audits  and  possible  regulatory  and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition,  the  landscape  for  music  licensing  is  constantly  changing,  and  music  fees  we  pay  are  subject  to  new  fee  demands  and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\n\n## Privacy and Data Security Regulation\n\nOur businesses are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers' personal information. In the United States, the Communications Act generally restricts cable operators' nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers' personally identifiable information, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests. We are  also  subject  to  various  state  and  federal  regulations  that  provide  privacy  protections  for  customer  proprietary  network information related to our voice services.\n\nThe FTC generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices. For example, the FTC often partners with state attorneys general to enforce transparency requirements regarding the collection and use of consumer information. These enforcement efforts may require ongoing review on our part of new and rapidly  evolving  technologies  and  methods  for  delivering  content  and  advertising  to  ensure  that  appropriate  notice  is  given  to consumers and consent is obtained where required in connection with the collection, use or sharing of personal information. We are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  states  have  enacted  detailed  laws  establishing  explicit  consumer  privacy  protections  and  data  security requirements in  their  respective  states.  For  example,  the  California  Consumer  Privacy Act  ('CCPA')  gives  California  residents rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of 'Personal Information,' as well as rights to access, delete  and  restrict  the  sale  of  certain  personal  information  collected  about  them.  Moreover,  all  50  states  have  security  breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach.\n\nCertain  of  our  businesses  are  subject  to  the  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  ('GDPR')  and  the  United Kingdom's Data Protection Act 2018 ('DPA'), which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively. DPA, GDPR and the Member States' legislation implementing the GDPR, related  rules  regulating  the  privacy  of  electronic  communications services and networks (including 'cookie' rules), and various initiatives by regulatory authorities pursuant to these laws affect how we are able to process certain personal data for particular purposes, what we must tell our customers about this processing, and what controls our customers have over such processing.\n\nPrivacy and data security remained a priority legislative issue in 2021. For example, new laws have been enacted in Virginia and Colorado, which come into effect in 2023 and include many requirements similar to those in the CCPA for companies that collect personal  information  from  consumers  in  those  states.  In  addition,  California  voters  approved  a  ballot  initiative  enacting  the California Privacy Rights Act ('CPRA'), which updates the CCPA and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to oversee implementation and enforcement of the state's privacy laws. Changes enacted in the CPRA generally go into",

          "chunk_text": "- Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online services to collect information from minors, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the United Kingdom's Age-Appropriate Design Code.\n- Various  laws  with  regard  to  content  moderation  and  removal,  and  related  disclosure  obligations,  such  as  the Network Enforcement Act in Germany and the European Union's pending Digital Services Act, which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of third-party content and the limitations of existing technologies. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the  United  Kingdom,  have  implemented  or  are  considering  similar  legislation  imposing  penalties  for  failure  to remove certain types of content.\n- Various legislative, litigation, and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business model, which could result in monetary penalties, damages and/or prohibition.\n- Various legislative and regulatory activity requiring disclosure of information about the operation of our services and  algorithms,  which  may  make  it  easier  for  websites  to  artificially  promote  low-quality,  deceptive,  or  harmful content on services like Google Search and YouTube, potentially harming the quality of our services.\n\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could harm our business. For example:\n\n- We rely  on  statutory  safe  harbors,  as  set  forth  in  the  Digital  Millennium  Copyright Act  and  Section  230  of  the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us. There are legislative proposals in both the U.S. and EU that could reduce our safe harbor protection.\n- Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014 on the 'right to be forgotten,' which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens.\n\nThe  introduction  of  new  businesses,  products,  services,  and  technologies,  our  activities  in  certain  jurisdictions,  or other  actions  we  take  have  subjected  us,  and  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us,  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  Our investment  in  a  variety  of  new  fields,  such  as  healthcare  and  payment  services,  has  expanded,  and  will  continue  to expand, the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high  and  are  likely  to  increase  in  the  future. Any  failure  on  our  part  to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  can  result  in negative  publicity  and  diversion  of  management  time  and  effort  and  may  subject  us  to  significant  liabilities  and  other penalties.\n\n## We are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  claims,  suits,  government  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and  consent  decrees  involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products and services, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, or service disruptions or failures.\n\nAny  of  these  types  of  legal  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  of management resources, negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\n\nOur products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other companies' websites, and we offer third-party products, services, and/or content. The law relating to the liability of online service providers for others' activities on their services is still somewhat unsettled around the world. Claims have been brought against us, and we",

In contrast, Meta utilizes multiple platforms including its investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites, as well as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal social media accounts\u2014Facebook, Instagram, and Threads\u2014for the same purpose.

      "answer": "Disney specifically identifies adverse weather conditions as a risk factor that could directly impact its operations, business plans, or profitability, particularly affecting entertainment, travel, and leisure businesses through disruptions in content creation, demand for products and services, and distribution via partners. Meta, on the other hand, discloses that adverse weather conditions could contribute to interruptions in the availability or performance of its products and services due to infrastructure disruptions, which could harm user engagement and advertising revenue. While both cite adverse weather as a risk, Disney's exposure centers on operational disruptions in physical and content-based offerings, and Meta's risk relates to technical infrastructure reliability and service availability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Disney mentions adverse weather conditions as a risk factor that may affect operations, business plans, or profitability, particularly impacting entertainment, travel, and leisure businesses.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies disclose adverse weather as a risk, but the nature of the impact differs: Disney is exposed through disruptions to content creation and consumer demand, while Meta faces risks tied to infrastructure reliability and service uptime."

      "answer": "Disney highlights increased investment in technology related to environmental sustainability and compliance reporting as part of its ESG initiatives, though it does not disclose a specific dollar amount for these expenditures. In contrast, Meta explicitly allocates $18.02 billion in 2023 toward its Reality Labs segment, which focuses on developing immersive technologies like virtual and augmented reality as part of its metaverse strategy. These figures and priorities reflect divergent strategic directions: Disney's investments support regulatory compliance and sustainability goals, while Meta is heavily funding the development of next-generation computing platforms. The specificity of Meta's allocation underscores its aggressive push into hardware and foundational metaverse technologies, whereas Disney's technology investments are framed as part of broader operational adjustments.",

      "question": "How do AT&T and Verizon's wireless tower sublease arrangements differ in terms of future minimum payment obligations through 2028, and how does each company account for these arrangements on their balance sheets?",
      "answer": "AT&T has specified future minimum payments under its wireless tower sublease arrangement with Crown Castle totaling $269 for 2024, $274 for 2025, $280 for 2026, $285 for 2027, and $291 for 2028. In contrast, Verizon does not provide specific future minimum payment figures for its wireless tower leases in its 2023 10-K, only noting that lease terms range up to 30 years with options to extend. Both companies continue to carry the wireless tower assets on their balance sheets under Property, Plant and Equipment - Net and depreciate them, rather than recognizing a sale, due to the lack of transferred control. AT&T accounts for the financing obligation from the transaction using the effective interest method at approximately 3.9%, while Verizon includes the present value of ground leases in its operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, though it does not expect to make payments unless American Tower defaults.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AT&T's 10-K, extract the specific future minimum payments under the Crown Castle tower sublease through 2028: $269M (2024), $274M (2025), $280M (2026), $285M (2027), and $291M (2028).",
        "Step 2: From Verizon's 10-K, note that while the company has a similar arrangement with American Tower involving 11,300 towers and lease terms up to 30 years, it does not disclose specific future minimum payments.",
        "Step 3: Compare accounting treatments: both companies retain the towers on their balance sheets due to lack of control transfer and continue depreciation, but AT&T treats the proceeds as a financing obligation with interest, while Verizon includes ground lease liabilities in operating lease ROU assets."

In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help manage their network bandwidth.\n\nOur business services offerings for medium-sized and enterprise customers also include a software-defined networking product, and larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These services are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with  multiple  locations  both  within  and  outside  of  our  cable  distribution  footprint,  where  we  provide  coverage  outside  of  our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells to local, regional and national advertisers as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, and we also generate revenue from selling advertising on our digital  platforms.  Our  advertising  business  also  represents  the  advertising  sales  efforts  of  other  multichannel  video  providers  in some markets and offers additional technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nOur security and automation services provide home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal, mobile apps and the X1 platform. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\n\n## Network and Technology\n\nOur  Cable  Communications  cable  distribution  system  uses  a  hybrid  fiber-optic  and  coaxial  cable  network  that  we  believe  is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities  over  time.  This  network  provides  the  two-way  transmissions  that  are  essential  to  providing  broadband  services, interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  On  Demand  and  DVR,  voice  services,  and  security  and automation  services.  Leveraging  DOCSIS  3.1  technology,  Cable  Communications  currently  deploys  broadband  services  with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\n\nCable  Communications  continues  to  focus  on  technology  initiatives  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  next-generation  media  and content  delivery  platforms,  such  as  the  X1  and  Flex  platforms  and  cloud  DVR  technology  that  use  Internet  Protocol  ('IP') technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other  internet-based  apps,  and  on  demand  content  in  one  unified  experience  with  voice-activated  remote  control  search  and interactive  features.  Cable  Communications  also  pursues  technology  initiatives  related  to  broadband  services  that  leverage  our global technology platform, providing customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our xFi whole-home application and online portal, advanced security technology and other features.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\nTo offer video services, Cable Communications licenses substantial amounts of programming from cable and broadcast networks, as  well  as  from  local  broadcast  television  stations.  The  fees  associated  with  these  programming  distribution  agreements  are generally based on the number of subscribers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our On Demand service, online portal, mobile apps and Flex.\n\nFor  wireless  services,  we  have  an  MVNO  agreement  that  allows  us  to  offer  services  using  Verizon's  wireless  network  and  we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches that we sell to wireless customers.\n\nCable  Communications  purchases  from  a  limited  number  of  suppliers  a  significant  amount  of  customer  premise  equipment, including  wireless  gateways  and  set-top  boxes,  network  equipment  and  services  to  provide  services  to  residential  and  business customers.\n\nCable Communications uses two primary vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n- General Entertainment - Primarily internal production of and acquisition of rights to episodic television programs and news content. Internal content is generally produced by the following television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Television Animation; FX Productions; and various studios for which we commission productions for our branded channels and DTC streaming services\n- Sports - Primarily acquisition of professional and college sports programming rights and related production costs\n- International - Primarily internal production of and acquisition of rights to local content outside the U.S. and Canada\n- Selling, general and administrative costs, including marketing costs\n- Depreciation and amortization\n\n## Media and Entertainment Distribution Strategy\n\nThe Company has significantly increased its focus on distribution of content via our own DTC streaming services relative to traditional distribution of content. In general, film content was traditionally distributed first in the theatrical market, followed by the home entertainment market and then in the TV/SVOD market. In general, episodic television content was traditionally launched on our domestic linear networks and licensed for use globally in other TV/SVOD windows. Although the Company continues to monetize a significant amount of its content in the traditional manner, our focus on our own DTC distribution has had a number of impacts including but not limited to:\n\n- in some cases, we are producing exclusive content for our DTC streaming services;\n- rather than selling our content in the TV/SVOD market, we generally distribute it on our DTC streaming services; and\n- in part because of the impact of COVID-19 on theatrical markets around the world, we may alter our traditional theatrical distribution approach, for example by making a film available on our DTC streaming services at the same time it is in theaters or shortly thereafter (e.g. Premier Access).\n\nOver time, all else being equal, these impacts will tend to increase revenue and costs at Direct-to-Consumer and reduce revenue and costs at Content Sales/Licensing and Linear Networks. Our distribution approach is based on flexibility in our windowing strategy, and we may change our original launch and distribution strategy for any particular piece of content. Distribution decisions may impact revenues and viewership, and the allocation of costs to our businesses/distribution platforms, particularly programming, production and marketing costs, depends on the distribution approach.\n\nA more detailed discussion of our distribution businesses and production groups follows.\n\n## Linear Networks\n\nThe majority of Linear Networks revenue is derived from affiliate fees and advertising sales. The Company's linear networks businesses provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs and/or affiliated television stations that are generally based on contractually specified rates on a per subscriber basis. The amounts that we can charge to MVPDs for our networks is largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide and the competitive market for programming services. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand.\n\nLinear Networks consist of our domestic and international branded television channels.\n\n## Domestic Channels\n\nOur domestic channels include Cable operations comprising Disney, ESPN, Freeform, FX and National Geographic branded channels and Broadcasting operations comprising ABC and eight owned ABC affiliated television stations.\n\n## Cable\n\n## Disney Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: Disney Channel; Disney Junior; and Disney XD (collectively Disney Channels).\n\nDisney Channel - the Disney Channel airs original series and movie programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 2 to 14. The channel features live-action comedy series, animated programming and preschool series as well as original movies and theatrical films.\n\nDisney Junior - the Disney Junior channel airs programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 2 to 7 and their parents and caregivers. The channel features animated and live-action programming that blends Disney's storytelling and characters with learning. Disney Junior also airs as a programming block on the Disney Channel.\n\nDisney XD - the Disney XD channel airs programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 6 to 11. The channel features a mix of live-action and animated programming.",

      "question": "How does CMCSA's reliance on an MVNO agreement with Verizon for wireless services potentially constrain its ability to offer symmetrical broadband speeds compared to AT&T's fiber-to-the-premises deployments, given their respective network strategies?",
      "answer": "CMCSA relies on an MVNO agreement with Verizon to offer wireless services in the U.S., which means it does not control the underlying wireless infrastructure and is dependent on Verizon's network capabilities. This constrains CMCSA\u2019s ability to directly integrate wireless services with its HFC and fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) infrastructure, which offers symmetrical speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. In contrast, AT&T has invested heavily in fiber as a core priority, serving over 8.3 million consumer wireline broadband customers via fiber at the end of 2023, with a software-based network strategy that aligns with SDN and NFV technologies. AT&T\u2019s control over its infrastructure enables a more seamless integration of wireless and wireline services, supporting next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services efficiently. Therefore, CMCSA's dependence on Verizon\u2019s wireless network limits its ability to tightly coordinate wireless and high-speed fiber services compared to AT&T\u2019s vertically integrated fiber and wireless strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - CMCSA uses an MVNO agreement with Verizon to offer wireless services and offers FTTP with symmetrical speeds up to 10 Gbps.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - AT&T has over 8.3 million fiber broadband customers and aligns its fiber expansion with software-defined networking and NFV for integration with 5G.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - CMCSA's reliance on Verizon limits its ability to coordinate wireless with FTTP services, while AT&T's ownership of fiber infrastructure enables better integration with wireless services."

      "question": "How do the wireless service delivery strategies of Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) differ based on their network infrastructure investments and equipment integration models in 2023, and what specific technologies or financial commitments illustrate these differences?",
      "answer": "Comcast (CMCSA) focuses on network modernization through the deployment of DOCSIS 4.0 in select markets in 2023, which enables symmetrical multigigabit broadband speeds over its hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) network. Additionally, Comcast offers fiber-to-the-premises connections with symmetrical speeds up to 10 gigabits per second for customers who request it. On the other hand, AT&T's wireless and data services strategy involves tightly integrating customer premises equipment with its network infrastructure to deliver services. AT&T evaluates whether equipment constitutes a separate performance obligation, and when it does, revenue is recognized upon delivery and acceptance. These strategies differ in that Comcast emphasizes network-level infrastructure upgrades (e.g., DOCSIS 4.0), while AT&T focuses on equipment-service integration and revenue recognition timing tied to equipment delivery. The financial commitment by Comcast to network transformation is evidenced by its multiyear plan and rollout of advanced technologies, whereas AT&T\u2019s financial approach reflects a focus on bundling equipment and service revenue streams, recognizing them on a gross basis when control is maintained.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract specific information about Comcast's wireless and broadband infrastructure investments, including DOCSIS 4.0 deployment and fiber-to-the-premises offerings.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences in strategic focus\u2014Comcast on network transformation and AT&T on equipment-service integration\u2014and how each company monetizes its wireless and connectivity offerings."

      "question": "How does CMCSA's MVNO wireless strategy through Verizon contrast with AT&T's equipment bundling approach in terms of service delivery and revenue recognition under ASC 606?",
      "answer": "CMCSA offers wireless services using an MVNO agreement with Verizon, allowing it to leverage Verizon's wireless network without owning the underlying infrastructure. This strategy enables CMCSA to deliver wireless services using third-party infrastructure while focusing on its own Wi-Fi network and customer experience features like in-and-out-of-home connectivity and advanced security. In contrast, AT&T evaluates whether customer premises equipment constitutes a separate performance obligation under ASC 606. If the equipment is separable and not highly interrelated with the service, revenue from equipment sales is recognized upon delivery or acceptance, while service revenue is recognized over time as services are delivered. This reflects a more vertically integrated approach where equipment and service are sometimes treated as distinct deliverables with separate revenue recognition timing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CMCSA's filing, identify the MVNO arrangement with Verizon as the basis for offering wireless services without owning the wireless infrastructure.",

      "answer": "Google evaluates whether entities in which it invests are variable interest entities (VIEs) and consolidates them if it is the primary beneficiary. In contrast, AT&T holds an equity method investment in DIRECTV, which is classified as a VIE, but does not consolidate it because TPG Capital holds tie-breaking authority over key decisions, meaning AT&T is not the primary beneficiary. AT&T's investment in DIRECTV had an initial fair value of $6,852 million, and as of December 31, 2024, AT&T retained $1,370 million in distribution rights related to common units, while holding 70% of the common units.

T he  term between inv oicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or serv ices and customers, we require payment before the products or serv ices are deliv ered to the customer. Additionally, accounts receiv able includes amounts for serv ices performed in adv ance of the right to inv oice the customer.\n\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receiv able, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receiv able, and changes in such are classified as general and administrativ e expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess collectibility by rev iewing accounts receiv able on  a  collectiv e  basis  where  similar  characteristics  exist  and  on  an  indiv idual  basis  when  we  identify  specific  customers  with  known  disputes  or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit ev aluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\n## Convertible Notes\n\nOur inv estments in conv ertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Other\n\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity inv estments in companies with which we also entered into commercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the substance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components  of  the  arrangements  should  be  accounted  for  as  separate  transactions  under  the  applicable  GAAP,  and  determining  the  v alue  of  the components of the arrangements, including the fair v alue of the inv estments. Additionally, if our inv estment in such companies becomes impaired, we may need to re-ev aluate the accounting for the commercial arrangement, including reducing any remaining performance obligations.\n\n## Impairment of Investments\n\nWe periodically rev iew our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\n\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. T he credit loss is estimated by considering av ailable information relev ant to the collectibility of the security and information about past ev ents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&amp;E, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we hav e an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recov ery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair v alue and record the corresponding charge as a component of OI&amp;E.\n\nFor  non-marketable  equity  securities,  including  equity  method  inv estments,  we  consider  whether  impairment  indicators  exist  by  ev aluating  the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other indicators. If the assessment indicates that the inv estment is impaired,  we  write  down  the  inv estment  to  its  fair  v alue  by  recording  the  corresponding  charge  as  a  component  of  OI&amp;E.  We  prepare  quantitativ e measurements of the fair v alue of our equity inv estments using a market approach or an income approach.\n\n## Inventory\n\nInv entory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable v alue. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we hav e made an inv estment or in which we hav e other v ariable interests is considered a v ariable interest entity (VIE).

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nInvestments in partnerships, joint ventures and less than majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nOur investments in equity affiliates at December 31, 2024, primarily included our interests in DIRECTV and Gigapower.\n\nDIRECTV We account for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting. DIRECTV is considered a variable interest entity for accounting purposes. As DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&amp;T and TPG Capital (TPG), with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO, we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of DIRECTV. The initial fair value of the equity considerations at the date of acquisition was $6,852, which was determined using a discounted cash flow model reflecting distribution rights and preference of the individual instruments.\n\nThe ownership interests in DIRECTV, based on seniority, are as follows:\n\n- Preferred units with distribution rights of $1,800 held by TPG, which have been fully distributed.\n- Junior preferred units with distribution rights of $4,250 held by AT&amp;T, which were fully distributed as of December 31, 2023.\n- Distribution preference associated with Common units of $4,200 held by AT&amp;T, of which $1,370 of distribution rights remain as of December 31, 2024.\n- Common units, with 70% held by AT&amp;T and 30% held by TPG.\n\nOn September 29, 2024, we agreed to sell our interest in DIRECTV to TPG for approximately $7,600 in cash payments through 2029, inclusive of third-quarter and fourth-quarter 2024 combined distributions of $1,695.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, Disney faced direct FCC regulatory risk primarily related to the licensing of its television stations, where non-renewal or delayed renewal of licenses could result in substantial operational disruptions or fines. This risk was tied to its linear broadcasting operations, which are central to its media business. In contrast, Verizon faced a broader and more complex set of FCC regulatory risks across multiple business lines, including broadband (Title II regulation overturned in early 2025), VoIP services (911 and law enforcement compliance), video services (cable franchise obligations), and cybersecurity practices (national security equipment restrictions). Additionally, Verizon faced state-level regulatory pressures, such as New York\u2019s law requiring discounted broadband pricing for low-income customers. Given the multi-dimensional regulatory scrutiny across its services and the potential for direct financial impacts from compliance costs, service modifications, and legal exposure, Verizon faced a more immediate and extensive financial risk from FCC regulation in fiscal 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Disney's FCC risk is tied to broadcast station licensing, with potential consequences including fines, license renewal issues, and operational disruptions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Verizon faces FCC regulation across broadband, VoIP, video, privacy, cybersecurity, and intercarrier compensation, with additional state-level mandates like New York's discounted broadband law.",
        "Step 3: Compare the regulatory exposure scope and financial implications for both companies in fiscal 2024.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Verizon's exposure spans more services, has more compliance costs, and faces both federal and state regulatory actions, indicating higher immediate financial risk."

Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect linear channels include the following:\n\n- Licensing of television stations . Each of the television stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (and the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances and may delay renewals while permitting a licensee to continue operating. Although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past or have been permitted to continue operations when renewal is delayed, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Broadband\n\nVerizon offers many different broadband services. In early January 2025, based on litigation filed by the broadband industry , a federal appeals court overturned the FCC's April 2024 final decision to regulate broadband services via utility-style common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications A ct. A bsent further action in the courts, this decision will remain in effect and limit the risk of burdensome FCC broadband regulation. In addition to federal activity , several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our broadband services, including a law in New Y ork that requires discounted broadband pricing for low income customers. Some states may also impose pricing or other rules related to broadband built with the assistance of federal or state funding. The FCC also adopted broad rules related to \"digital discrimination\" that could further increase regulatory oversight of broadband services; industry groups have appealed those rules in court. Our broadband commitment can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-commitment.\n\n## Wireline Voice\n\nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as V oIP . For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of V oIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.\n\nState public utility  commissions regulate V erizon's telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. V erizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. V erizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. Some states, including California, impose reporting requirements and are considering new network reliability or service quality requirements for wireline voice services, including for V oIP.\n\n## Video\n\nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to V erizon. In areas where V erizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, V erizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.\n\n## Privacy, Data Protection, and Artificial Intelligence\n\nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products. A t the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending on the product or service. The California Consumer Privacy A ct, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and a number of other privacy laws more recently adopted by other states and countries include significant penalties for non-compliance. Generally , attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally , and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations.  These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. Policymakers at the local, state, federal and international levels are also considering imposing laws and regulations on the use of artificial intelligence (A I). This is a nascent area of regulatory focus; therefore, it is unclear how such regulation could impact our business.\n\n## Public Safety and Cybersecurity\n\nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media  (broadcast/cable)  and  wireless  emergency  alerting  services.  In  addition,  federal  and  state  agencies  have  mandated  and  may  impose  additional regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless providers to support roaming on each other's networks during disasters, and the California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations relating to back-up power for communications facilities. In response to prior  cyberattacks  and  increasing  risks  from  cybersecurity  threats,  the  FCC  and  other  regulators  are  attempting  to  increase  regulation  of  the cybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by A merican companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. V eriz on does not currently  use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions.\n\n## Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access\n\nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. V erizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments.",

(formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) ('Legacy Disney'). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as 'Obligor Group', and individually, as a 'Guarantor'. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF's assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the 'exchange notes') issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act'), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the 'TWDC Indenture') and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November 26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with the closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the '2001 Trustee') (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee).\n\nOther subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the 'non-Guarantors'). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at September 28, 2024 was as follows:\n\n",

Our efforts to maintain and grow our customer base and make improvements to our prepaid business, if successful, are also expected to benefit our wireless service revenue. We expect Fios revenue to benefit from growth in our Fios customer base and an ongoing demand for higher speed internet connections, which offsets the impact of the shift from bundled wireline services to standalone internet service.\n\nIn our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an increase in wireless volumes and strong FWA  revenue. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures.\n\n## Other Trends\n\nWe are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including through A I-driven technologies.\n\nWe expect that our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from our expected service revenue growth, despite the moderate expected increase in our 2025 capital program compared to 2024. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information on our capital program.\n\nIn the course of business, we make promotional equipment offers to attract and retain customers. In 2024, the growth of our wireless service revenue was unfavorably impacted by the amortization of wireless equipment sales and promotions. We expect these pressures to continue and increase in 2025. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, we had fewer phone upgrades compared to prior years. T o the extent upgrade volumes increase in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity . See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout M arket Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.\n\nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our ex ternal financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nOur 2025 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding and adding capacity and density to our core networks, the ongoing deployment of C-Band spectrum, and advancing our network architecture. It will also support our broadband expansion plans including the launch of our fixed wireless access solution for multi-dwelling units. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2025 capital program to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n\n- Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $142.2 billion, of which $21.7 billion (including $3.3 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $66.3 billion, of which $5.8 billion, are expected to be due within the next twelve months.

      "question": "How do the differences in vesting conditions for PSU awards between Netflix and Verizon reflect distinct approaches to executive compensation tied to performance metrics?",
      "answer": "Netflix ties PSU awards to predetermined market-based performance targets over performance periods ranging from one to three years, with vesting dependent on achieving these targets. In contrast, Verizon includes Dividend Equivalent Units (DEUs) in its PSU awards, which are paid only if the PSU award vests and in the same proportion, indicating an additional layer of performance-linked payout. This shows that while both companies use PSUs to incentivize performance, Netflix focuses on market-based goals, whereas Verizon incorporates both performance vesting and dividend alignment.",

In contrast, Verizon has $16.7 billion in unconditional purchase obligations for content, with payments staggered over future years ($6.2 billion in 2025, $5.5 billion in 2026, etc.). These commitments are not classified as debt but represent binding agreements to purchase content and other services in the future.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company's intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\n## Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as 'Content assets, net' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use over ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically ex pects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company's behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company's service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company's content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax  positions, tax -related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the ex pected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables primarily consist of membership and advertising fees due to the Company. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and ex ternal market factors.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that",

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, which may not be wellreceived by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete",

Our ability to continue to attract subscribers to the HBO Max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscribers with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choices. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, promotions, and pricing and related features of competitors to HBO Max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers. If consumers do not perceive our offerings to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or offerings, terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings, experience technical issues, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers. In addition, many subscribers to these types of offerings originate from word-of-mouth advertising from then existing subscribers. If our efforts to satisfy subscribers are not successful, including because we terminate or modify promotional or trial-period offerings or because of technical issues with the platform, we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf subscribers cancel or decide to not continue subscriptions for any reason, including a perception that they do not use it sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, unsatisfactory availability of content, promotions or trial-period offers expire or are modified, competitive services or promotions provide a better value or experience, and customer service or technical issues are not satisfactorily resolved, our business will be adversely affected. We must continually add new subscribers both to replace canceled subscribers and to grow our business. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that a significant portion of our content costs are committed and contracted over several years based on minimum subscriber delivery levels, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per subscriber) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in retaining and attracting new subscribers, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of subscribers do cancel, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures or offer significantly more generous promotions to replace these subscribers with new subscribers.\n\n## Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.\n\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including, at any particular time, claims relating to antitrust; patent infringement; wage and hour; personal injury; customer privacy violations; regulatory proceedings; and selling and collection practices. We also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards, which may entail related investigations and litigation. In the wireless area, we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effects on customers or employees who use such technologies including, for example, wireless devices. We may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our operations or financial results.\n\n## Cyberattacks, equipment failures, natural disasters and terrorist acts may materially adversely affect our operations.\n\nCyberattacks, major equipment failures or natural disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes and forest fires, whether caused by discrete severe weather events and/or precipitated by long-term climate change and earthquakes, software problems, data and privacy breaches, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or IT security that affect our networks, including software and switches, microwave links, third-party-owned local and long-distance networks on which we rely, our cell sites or other equipment, our satellites, our customer account support and information systems, or employee and business records could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our wired network in particular is becoming increasingly reliant on software as it evolves to handle increasing demands for video transmission. While we have been subject to security incidents or cyberattacks, these did not result in a material adverse effect on our operations. However, as such attacks continue to increase in scope and frequency, we may be unable to prevent a significant attack in the future. Our inability to deploy or operate our networks or customer support systems or protect sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information could result in significant expenses, potential legal liability, a loss of current or future customers and reputation damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.",

      "answer": "Both NFLX and T identify that competitor service levels, content offerings, and pricing can significantly affect their ability to retain and attract subscribers. For NFLX, if they do not grow as expected, given that their content costs are largely fixed and contracted over several years, they may not be able to adjust expenditures or increase per membership revenues commensurate with a lowered growth rate, which could adversely affect margins, liquidity, and results of operations. Similarly, T notes that a significant portion of its content costs for HBO Max are committed based on minimum subscriber delivery levels. If subscriber growth falls short, T may be unable to adjust costs accordingly, leading to margin pressure and potentially needing to increase marketing expenditures or offer more generous promotions. In both cases, the inability to retain or grow subscribers due to competitive pressures could lead to financial underperformance and operational challenges.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face similar financial risks tied to subscriber retention and growth, where fixed or committed content costs create financial inflexibility if subscriber growth underperforms due to competitive pressures."

If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete",

Our ability to continue to attract subscribers to the HBO Max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscribers with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choices. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, promotions, and pricing and related features of competitors to HBO Max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers. If consumers do not perceive our offerings to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or offerings, terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings, experience technical issues, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers. In addition, many subscribers to these types of offerings originate from word-of-mouth advertising from then existing subscribers. If our efforts to satisfy subscribers are not successful, including because we terminate or modify promotional or trial-period offerings or because of technical issues with the platform, we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf subscribers cancel or decide to not continue subscriptions for any reason, including a perception that they do not use it sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, unsatisfactory availability of content, promotions or trial-period offers expire or are modified, competitive services or promotions provide a better value or experience, and customer service or technical issues are not satisfactorily resolved, our business will be adversely affected. We must continually add new subscribers both to replace canceled subscribers and to grow our business. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that a significant portion of our content costs are committed and contracted over several years based on minimum subscriber delivery levels, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per subscriber) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in retaining and attracting new subscribers, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of subscribers do cancel, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures or offer significantly more generous promotions to replace these subscribers with new subscribers.\n\n## Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.\n\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including, at any particular time, claims relating to antitrust; patent infringement; wage and hour; personal injury; customer privacy violations; regulatory proceedings; and selling and collection practices. We also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards, which may entail related investigations and litigation. In the wireless area, we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effects on customers or employees who use such technologies including, for example, wireless devices. We may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our operations or financial results.\n\n## Cyberattacks, equipment failures, natural disasters and terrorist acts may materially adversely affect our operations.\n\nCyberattacks, major equipment failures or natural disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes and forest fires, whether caused by discrete severe weather events and/or precipitated by long-term climate change and earthquakes, software problems, data and privacy breaches, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or IT security that affect our networks, including software and switches, microwave links, third-party-owned local and long-distance networks on which we rely, our cell sites or other equipment, our satellites, our customer account support and information systems, or employee and business records could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our wired network in particular is becoming increasingly reliant on software as it evolves to handle increasing demands for video transmission. While we have been subject to security incidents or cyberattacks, these did not result in a material adverse effect on our operations. However, as such attacks continue to increase in scope and frequency, we may be unable to prevent a significant attack in the future. Our inability to deploy or operate our networks or customer support systems or protect sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information could result in significant expenses, potential legal liability, a loss of current or future customers and reputation damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.",

      "answer": "For NFLX, reliable broadband connectivity is a critical enabler for international expansion, particularly in targeted areas, as stated in their 2022 10-K filing. Without sufficient broadband infrastructure, NFLX faces risks such as consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment, and dissatisfaction with their service, which could harm their international operations and overall business. In contrast, T's 2022 10-K emphasizes broadband connectivity (e.g., fiber and 5G) as a strategic investment area within its broader business transformation initiatives. T aims to modernize infrastructure to reduce costs and improve margins, with the expectation that these investments will support customer value and improved experience. While NFLX depends on existing broadband infrastructure to deliver content globally, T is actively investing in and building next-generation broadband infrastructure as part of its operational modernization and competitive positioning.",

For example, the European Union revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers' catalogs, and to require prominence of those works.\n\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\n## We are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for taxes.\n\nTax laws are being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Risks Related to Human Resources\n\n## We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted.\n\n## Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\n\nOur partners, suppliers, vendors and we employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins.",

These suppliers could fail to provide equipment on a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technologies, inability to secure component parts, general business disruption, natural disasters, safety issues, economic and political instability and public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may again cause, delays in the development, manufacturing (including the sourcing of key components) and shipment of products. In certain limited circumstances, suppliers have been unable to supply products in a timely fashion. In such limited circumstances, we have been unable to provide products and services precisely as and when requested by our customers. It is possible that, in some circumstances, we could be forced to switch to a different key supplier. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products of one or more key suppliers with products from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negative effect on our operating results.\n\n## Increasing costs to provide services and failure to renew agreements on favorable terms or at all, could adversely affect operating margins.\n\nOur operating costs, including customer acquisition and retention costs, could continue to put pressure on margins and customer retention levels.\n\nA number of our competitors offering comparable legacy services that rely on alternative technologies and business models are typically subject to less (or no) regulation, and therefore are able to operate with lower costs. These competitors generally can focus on discrete customer segments since they do not have regulatory obligations to provide universal service. Also, these competitors have cost advantages compared to us, due in part to operating on newer, more technically advanced and lower-cost networks with a nonunionized workforce, lower employee benefits and fewer retirees. We are transitioning services from our old copper-based network and seeking regulatory approvals, where needed, at both the state and federal levels. If we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our network transition or obtain approvals with onerous conditions, we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantages.\n\nOur WarnerMedia operations, which create and license content to other providers, may experience increasing difficulties securing favorable terms, including those related to pricing, positioning and packaging, during contract negotiations, which may lead to blackouts of WarnerMedia programming, and WarnerMedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks and premium pay television services in offerings by third parties.\n\n## We may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives, and these efforts could have  a  materially  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operations,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  competitive position.\n\nWe have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives, which are designed to reduce costs, streamline and modernize distribution and customer service, remove redundancies and simplify and improve processes and support functions. Our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience. We intend for these efficiencies to enable increased investments in our strategic areas of focus, which consist of improving broadband connectivity (for example, fiber and 5G), developing software-based entertainment (such as HBO Max) and utilizing WarnerMedia's storytelling legacy to engage consumers and gain insights across multiple distribution points. We also expect these initiatives to drive efficiencies and improved margins. If we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives, or if they are inadequate or ineffective, we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits, improvements may be delayed, not sustained or not realized, and our business, operations and competitive position could be adversely affected.",

      "answer": "Alphabet's share repurchase program and dividend policies give its Board of Directors significant discretion in managing capital returns, which can affect stock price volatility and shareholder equity structure. Additionally, Alphabet\u2019s charter provisions, such as prohibiting cumulative voting and allowing board-elected directors, reinforce concentrated control by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who hold 52.1% of voting power. Similarly, Netflix\u2019s charter documents include anti-takeover mechanisms like classified boards and restrictions on shareholder actions, which, like Alphabet\u2019s, limit stockholder influence and increase barriers to acquisition.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Dev elopment (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achiev ing consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effectiv e tax rate of 15%, on which various jurisdictions around the world hav e either introduced draft legislation or adopted final legislation. Our effectiv e tax rate and cash tax payments could increase as a result of these changes.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or dividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\n\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not hav e an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. In April 2024, we announced the approv al of our cash div idend program and began paying regular cash div idends to our Class A, Class B, and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash div idends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including the Delaware General Corporation Law . Our cash div idend program does not require, and our Board of Directors may decide not to declare, a cash div idend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a div idend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision by our Board of Directors may depend on a v ariety of factors that it may deem relev ant, including but not limited to our earnings, liquidity, financial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, lev el of indebtedness, and general market conditions. Our share repurchases or div idends could affect our share trading prices, increase their v olatility, reduce our cash reserv es and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\n\n## The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.\n\nOur  Class  B  stock  has  10  v otes  per  share,  our  Class  A  stock  has  one  v ote  per  share,  and  our  Class  C  stock  has  no  v oting  rights.  As  of December  31,  2024,  Larry  Page  and  Sergey  Brin  beneficially  owned  approximately  87.4%  of  our  outstanding  Class  B  stock,  which  represented approximately 52.1% of the v oting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey hav e significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approv al, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no v oting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentiv e programs, could continue Larry and Sergey's current relativ e v oting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a v ote of our stockholders. T he share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey's relativ e voting power. This concentrated control limits or sev erely restricts other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not v iew as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\n\n## Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\nProvisions in Alphabet's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may hav e the effect of delaying or prev enting a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\n- Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a v acancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or remov al of a director.\n- Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.\n- Our certificate  of  incorporation  prohibits  cumulativ e  v oting  in  the  election  of  directors.  T his  limits  the  ability  of  minority  stockholders  to  elect director candidates.\n- Stockholders must prov ide adv ance notice to nominate indiv iduals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. These prov isions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.",

Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\n## Our stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n- variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n- variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n- announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n- competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n- market volatility in general;\n- the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n- the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n- the operating results of our competitors; and\n- other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may ex perience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.\n\n## Preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the adsupported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the ex pectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the",

      "question": "How do Google's and Netflix's content licensing financial strategies differ in terms of cash flow commitments and amortization approaches?",
      "answer": "Google reported $55.4 billion in material purchase commitments as of the end of the year, with a significant portion related to content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. These commitments include non-cancelable portions or minimum cancellation fees, indicating a binding financial obligation structure. In contrast, Netflix disclosed that payments for content, including both licenses and production, are classified within 'Net cash provided by operating activities' and often require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Netflix amortizes content assets over the shorter of the contractual window or estimated period of use (typically accelerated, with over 90% amortized within four years), while Google does not explicitly disclose an amortization policy for its content licenses. Thus, Google's strategy involves large, binding financial commitments, while Netflix's approach emphasizes upfront cash outflows with accelerated amortization tied to content usage patterns.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically ex pect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are ex pected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future tax able income, and prudent and feasible tax  planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future tax able income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.",

Some  of  the components we use in our technical infrastructure  and  our  dev ices  are  av ailable  from  only  one  or  limited  sources,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  find replacement vendors on fav orable terms in the ev ent of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our v endors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product av ailability.\n\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions.  We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts hav e v olume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the v olume of sales of our dev ices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain  of  our  competitors  may  negotiate  more  fav orable  contractual  terms  based  on  v olume  and  other  commitments  that  may  prov ide  them  with competitiv e adv antages and may affect our supply. For example, industry supply capacity for AI accelerators, including Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs, as well as our custom-built TPUs, is highly competitiv e and rapidly ev olv ing.  If we are unable to negotiate fav orable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first, we may face supply constraints.\n\nOur devices hav e had, and in the future may hav e, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations.

If  the  quality  of  our  products  and  serv ices  does  not  meet expectations  or  our  products  or  serv ices  are  defectiv e  or  require  a  recall,  it  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating results.\n\nWe require our suppliers  and  business  partners  to  comply  with  laws  and,  where  applicable,  our  company  policies  and  practices,  such  as  the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, env ironmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing,  but  we  do  not  control  them  or  their  practices.  Violations  of  law  or  unethical  business  practices  could  result  in  supply  chain  disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or serv ices and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\n\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nThe  av ailability  of  our  products  and  serv ices  and  fulfillment  of  our  customer  contracts  depend  on  the  continuing  operation  of  our  information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change (such as sea lev el rise, drought, flooding, heat wav es, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire prev ention, and increased storm sev erity), power and transmission av ailability challenges, utility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, cyber attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of serv ice attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of v andalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area.

We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and experiences, and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched for patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology and products, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\n## Risks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. The addition of new features or upgrades also increases our exposure to vulnerabilities, and generative artificial intelligence could intensify these cybersecurity risks. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below. With our annual impairment testing as of October 1, the calculated fair value of each reporting unit ex ceeded its book value.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we updated the long-term strategic plan of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The updated plans reflected lower long-term projected future cash flows associated with the industry-wide secular decline, including a faster-than-previously anticipated decline of legacy services. We identified this as an impairment indicator and performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The interim impairment test methodology was consistent with our approach for annual impairment testing (see Note 1), using similar models updated with our current view of key inputs and assumptions. We concluded that the calculated fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit was lower than the book value, resulting in a goodwill impairment. As a result, in the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4,422 in our consolidated statements of income, which represented the entirety of Business Wireline reporting unit goodwill.\n\nIn 2022, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $13,478 in our Business Wireline reporting unit, $10,508 in our Consumer Wireline reporting unit and the entire $826 in our Mexico reporting unit. The decline in fair values was primarily due to changes in the macroeconomic environment, namely increased weighted-average cost of capital. Also, inflation pressure and lower projected cash flows driven by secular declines, predominantly at Business Wireline, impacted the fair values.\n\nChanges to our goodwill in 2024 resulted from the noncash impairment discussed above. Changes to our goodwill in 2023 resulted from goodwill attributed to assets contributed to the formation of strategic joint ventures.\n\nOur Communications segment has three reporting units: Mobility, Consumer Wireline and Business Wireline. Business Wireline goodwill was fully impaired in the third quarter of 2024. The reporting unit is deemed to be the operating segment for Latin America and its goodwill was fully impaired in 2022. At December 31, 2024, accumulated goodwill impairments totaled $29,234.\n\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill for the Communications segment:\n\n",

The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the WA CC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test requires key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factors in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA  growth relative to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach reflects significant judgment involved in the selection of comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies and multiples is influenced by differences in growth and profitability , and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in one or a combination of these inputs could result in a goodwill impairment.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit. Our qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair v alue of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit in accordance with our policy . We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates. Our assessment indicated that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit, the fair value of the Consumer reporting unit would have still exceeded its book value. We do not believe reasonable changes in significant assumptions would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 bps or if the discount rate increased by 50 bps, the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given the low excess of fair value over carrying value identified in our 2022 annual impairment assessment and increased competitive and market pressures experienced throughout 2023. These pressures resulted in lower projected cash flows primarily driven by secular declines in wireline services and products across our Business customer groups. In connection with V erizon's annual budget process in the fourth quarter of 2023, leadership completed a comprehensive five-year strategic planning review of our Business reporting unit resulting in declines in financial projections driven by market dynamics as compared to the prior year five-year strategic planning cycle. The revised projections were used as a key input into the Business reporting unit's annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, changes in the macroeconomic environment, including interest rate and inflationary pressures also impacted the fair value of the reporting unit. We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of our Business reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As  a  result,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  we  recorded  a  noncash  goodwill  impairment  charge  of  approximately  $5.8  billion  ($5.8  billion  after-tax )  in  our consolidated statement of income. The goodwill balance of the Business reporting unit was approximately $7.5 billion prior to the occurrence of this impairment charge.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given the impairment of the Business reporting unit's goodwill in the prior year. In addition, the Business reporting unit has continued to experience competitive and market pressures throughout 2024, that may persist over the near term. We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which indicated that the fair value of our Business reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. A t the goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2024, our Business reporting unit had a fair v alue that ex ceeded its carry ing amount by approximately 8% and remains susceptible to future impairment risk. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant assumptions to change the outcome of the quantitative impairment assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 bps, or if the discount rate increased by 50 bps, or if the EBITDA  margin decreased by 100 basis points, the fair value of our Business reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value. However, management believes there is a continued risk that our Business reporting unit may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the future. A s of December 31, 2024, $1.7 billion of goodwill was allocated to our Business reporting unit. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nA projected sustained decline in the reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and could result in future impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by , among other things: (1) decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the reporting unit's inability to achieve or delays in achieving its goals or strategic initiativ es. A dv erse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\n## Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nWe  maintain  benefit  plans  for  most  of  our  employees,  including,  for  certain  employees,  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans.  Benefit  plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income,",

A lthough certain advanced use cases for 5G technologies and related ecosystems are in the early phases of adoption, we believe that they will provide an opportunity for growth in the coming years.\n\nWe expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customer demand for mobile and FWA  5G connectivity continues to expand and customers shift to higher access plans. A dditionally , we expect service revenue to benefit from targeted pricing actions and increased connections per account. Future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our networks and services and the development of new 5G use cases and ecosystems.\n\nPricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless competitive landscape. A s the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans and bundled services at competitive prices.  In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in recent years in an effort to encourage customers to switch carriers, as well as retain existing customers. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices, with a variety of content options and other perks, that we believe provide significant value for the price. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements.\n\nFor further details on competitive environment and trends, refer to \"Business - Competition and Related Trends\" in Part I, Item 1 and \"Risk Factors - Economic and Strategic Risks - We face significant competition that may negatively affect our operating results\" in Part I, Item 1A  of this A nnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Connection Trends\n\nIn our Consumer segment, we are focused on attracting new customers and maintaining our high-quality retail postpaid customer base by capitalizing on demand for reliable high-speed connectivity and customizable, personalized offerings and solutions. We believe the combination of our wireless network quality and service and product offerings represents an attractive value proposition and provides a compelling customer experience, supporting increased penetration of data services.  While our  Consumer segment experienced diminished wireless connection growth in recent years, we expect that future connection growth opportunities will be driven by the comparative value we provide to our customers, as well as our FWA  broadband service. In our prepaid business, while we expect to continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, we are making improvements to achieve long-term growth.\n\nWe expect to continue to grow our Fios internet connections as we seek to expand availability of Fios, increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas, and experience continued strong demand for higher speed internet connections. Our pending acquisition of Frontier is expected to enhance our fiber broadband footprint and provide opportunities for future growth. A t the same time, we expect continued growth of FWA  connections to complement strong Fios results as demand for broadband services continues to grow.\n\nIn Fios video, the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market. We have experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have switched to alternative technologies such as wireless, V oIP , and cable for voice and data services, and we expect this trend to continue.\n\nIn  our  Business  segment,  we  offer  wireless  products  and  services  to  business  and  public  sector  customers  across  the  U.S.  W e  continue  to  grow  our connections while operating in a highly competitive environment. We expect that this connection growth, combined with our industry-leading network assets, will provide  additional  opportunities  to  sell  solutions,  such  as  those  around  security ,  private  networking  and  other  network  connectivity  services,  advanced communications and professional services.",

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below. With our annual impairment testing as of October 1, the calculated fair value of each reporting unit ex ceeded its book value.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we updated the long-term strategic plan of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The updated plans reflected lower long-term projected future cash flows associated with the industry-wide secular decline, including a faster-than-previously anticipated decline of legacy services. We identified this as an impairment indicator and performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The interim impairment test methodology was consistent with our approach for annual impairment testing (see Note 1), using similar models updated with our current view of key inputs and assumptions. We concluded that the calculated fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit was lower than the book value, resulting in a goodwill impairment. As a result, in the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4,422 in our consolidated statements of income, which represented the entirety of Business Wireline reporting unit goodwill.\n\nIn 2022, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $13,478 in our Business Wireline reporting unit, $10,508 in our Consumer Wireline reporting unit and the entire $826 in our Mexico reporting unit. The decline in fair values was primarily due to changes in the macroeconomic environment, namely increased weighted-average cost of capital. Also, inflation pressure and lower projected cash flows driven by secular declines, predominantly at Business Wireline, impacted the fair values.\n\nChanges to our goodwill in 2024 resulted from the noncash impairment discussed above. Changes to our goodwill in 2023 resulted from goodwill attributed to assets contributed to the formation of strategic joint ventures.\n\nOur Communications segment has three reporting units: Mobility, Consumer Wireline and Business Wireline. Business Wireline goodwill was fully impaired in the third quarter of 2024. The reporting unit is deemed to be the operating segment for Latin America and its goodwill was fully impaired in 2022. At December 31, 2024, accumulated goodwill impairments totaled $29,234.\n\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill for the Communications segment:\n\n",

( 3)\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit. Our qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair v alue of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit in accordance with our policy . We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates. Our assessment indicated that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given the low excess of fair value over carrying value identified in our 2022 annual impairment assessment and increased competitive and market pressures experienced throughout 2023. These pressures resulted in lower projected cash flows primarily driven by secular declines in wireline services and products across our Business customer groups. In connection with V erizon's annual budget process in the fourth quarter of 2023, leadership completed a comprehensive five-year strategic planning review of our Business reporting unit resulting in declines in financial projections driven by market dynamics as compared to the prior year five-year strategic planning cycle. The revised projections were used as a key input into the Business reporting unit's annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, changes in the macroeconomic environment, including interest rate and inflationary pressures also impacted the fair value of the reporting unit. We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of our Business reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As  a  result,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  we  recorded  a  noncash  goodwill  impairment  charge  of  approximately  $5.8  billion  ($5.8  billion  after-tax )  in  our consolidated statement of income.",

With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs, other DTC streaming services and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nLinear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry, including subscriber levels, and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nContent Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment and a significant number of companies that produce and/or distribute film and episodic content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay TV/VOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nWe also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies and video-on-demand services for creative and performing talent, story properties, show concepts, scripted and other programming, advertiser support, production facilities and exhibition outlets that are essential to the success of our Entertainment businesses.\n\nAdvertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber levels of MVPDs.\n\n## SPORTS\n\nThe Sports segment generally encompasses the Company's sports-focused global television and DTC video streaming content production and distribution activities.\n\nThe lines of business within Sports include the following:\n\n- ESPN (generally owned 80% by the Company)\n- Domestic:\n- Seven ESPN-branded television channels\n- ESPN on ABC (sports programmed on the ABC Network by ESPN)\n- ESPN+ DTC service\n- International: ESPN-branded channels outside of the U.S.\n- Star: Star-branded sports channels in India\n\nIn February 2024, the Company, Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. announced plans to create a joint venture to offer a sports-focused DTC platform (Venu Sports) that will distribute each party's domestic sports networks, certain broadcast networks and sports streaming services. In August 2024, a motion for preliminary injunction in a matter before the District Court for the Southern District of New York was granted, enjoining the launch of Venu Sports. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this legal matter. Further, the formation and launch of Venu Sports are subject to the finalization of definitive agreements among the parties.\n\nIn early fall 2025, the Company plans to launch a new DTC offering, which will include live linear streams of the domestic ESPN-branded television channels and ESPN+.\n\nThe significant revenues of Sports are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising\n- Subscription fees\n- Other revenue - Fees from the following activities: pay-per-view events on ESPN+, sub-licensing of sports rights, programming ESPN on ABC and licensing the ESPN brand",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations or digital properties. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number and forms of entertainment choices available. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur domestic cable networks and international networks compete primarily with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming service providers. Our domestic broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations  with  independently owned local broadcast television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience. Peacock competes for subscribers primarily with other DTC streaming service providers, as well as with traditional providers of linear television programming.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of our studios primarily depends on the number of films and television series and episodes produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Our studios also compete to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on television networks, and on DTC streaming services.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nOur theme parks compete with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, tourism, recreational activities and lodging. The competitive position of our theme parks primarily depends on the quality and popularity of rides and attractions, including effective use of intellectual property in themed  attractions.  There  is  increased  competition  in  areas  with  high  concentrations  of  theme  parks  and  other  attractions  operated  by  several  companies. Macroeconomic conditions and other factors may also result in shifting consumer preferences toward other types of destinations, experiences and products.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nRevenue and costs and expenses in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic G ames and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic G ames. Costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the recognition of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Media is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Domestic advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the winter holiday season, and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively.  International  advertising  revenue typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months, with lower levels in summer months due to the timing of European football seasons, winter holidays and summer vacations. Revenue also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year.\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, through DTC streaming services and viewing on demand, and on physical and digital home entertainment products. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the winter holiday season. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film's ex hibition in movie theaters. Content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees. Revenue from our television studios fluctuates in part due to a correlation with the broadcast network season beginning annually in September.\n\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the winter holiday season.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "Comcast manages sports rights as executory contracts without impairment, indicating a structured and potentially long-term financial commitment to sports programming. In contrast, Disney operates 10 Star sports channels in India with approximately 79 million subscribers and holds a 30% interest in CTV Specialty Television, Inc., which operates major Canadian sports networks. This ownership stake exposes Disney to equity income fluctuations based on CTV\u2019s performance. The difference in scale and financial structure means Comcast may have more predictable cost management for sports rights, while Disney has more direct financial exposure through both subscriber-based affiliate revenues and equity investment returns.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Comcast accounts for sports rights as executory contracts and does not subject them to impairment, indicating a structured financial treatment tied to contract utilization.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Disney operates 10 Star sports channels in India with approximately 79 million subscribers, showing a large direct subscriber-based exposure to sports programming.",
        "Step 3: Also from evidence_source_b, Disney holds a 30% equity interest in CTV, which operates major Canadian sports networks, adding an equity income component to its sports programming revenue model.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Comcast\u2019s approach limits financial volatility by treating sports rights as amortized costs, while Disney\u2019s structure ties its returns to subscriber levels and equity performance, creating different financial risk and strategic positioning profiles."

Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When performing an impairment assessment, we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.\n\n53\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

CTV operates television networks in Canada, including The Sports Networks (TSN) 1-5, Le R\u00e9seau des Sports (RDS), RDS2, RDS Info, Discovery Canada, Discovery Science and Animal Planet Canada.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nSports competes for viewers' attention and audience share primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services, social media and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards.\n\nThe Sports television networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nWe also compete with other media and entertainment companies and video-on-demand services for sports rights, creative and performing talent and other programming, advertiser support and production facilities that are essential to the success of our Sports businesses.\n\nAdvertising revenues are subject to changes in viewership levels and the demand for sports programming. Advertising revenues generated from sports programming are also impacted by the timing of sports seasons and events, which timing may vary throughout the year or may take place periodically (e.g. biannually, quadrennially). Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber levels of MVPDs.\n\n## EXPERIENCES\n\nThe lines of business within Experiences along with their significant business activities include the following:\n\n- Parks &amp; Experiences:\n- Domestic:\n- Theme parks and resorts:\n- Walt Disney World Resort in Florida\n- Disneyland Resort in California\n- Experiences:\n- Disney Cruise Line\n- Disney Vacation Club\n- National Geographic Expeditions (owned 73% by the Company) and Adventures by Disney\n- Aulani, a Disney Resort &amp; Spa in Hawaii\n- International:\n- Theme parks and resorts:\n- Disneyland Paris\n- Hong Kong Disneyland Resort (48% ownership interest and consolidated in our financial results)\n- Shanghai Disney Resort (43% ownership interest and consolidated in our financial results)\n- In addition, the Company licenses its IP to a third party that owns and operates Tokyo Disney Resort\n- Consumer Products:\n- Licensing of our trade names, characters, visual, literary and other IP to various manufacturers, game developers, publishers and retailers throughout the world, for use on merchandise, published materials and games\n- Sale of branded merchandise through online, retail and wholesale businesses, and development and publishing of books, comic books and magazines (except National Geographic magazine, which is reported in Entertainment)",

In the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by unauthorized parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hacking, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, malicious social engineering, theft, misconduct, fraud and other malicious activities. Incidents can be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns, human error, software or hardware failures or vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.\n\nCyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. For example, we expect threat actors will continue to gain sophistication by using tools and techniques, such as AI, that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks,  information  systems  and  other  technologies  across  the  world  and  create  latent  vulnerabilities  in  our  and  third-party  vendors'  systems  and  other technologies. We also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, that in many cases is provided or made available to third-party vendors who agree to protect it, which has in the past, and may in the future, become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information by us or a third party. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form.  We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, as well as rely on service providers to help us perform our business operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks  with  respect  to  such  third-party  suppliers  and  service  providers  and  their  products  and  services.  Due  to  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity breaches or incidents experienced by such third parties in relation to the information we share with them. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and those of our third-party vendors, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues.\n\nWhile we develop and maintain systems, and operate programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents has caused, and may from time to time in the future cause, a variety of business impacts. These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security  of  our  internal  systems,  products,  services  or  satellite  transmission  signals,  power  outages,  and  the  compromise  or  ex filtration  of  sensitive,  personal, proprietary, confidential or technical business information and customer or vendor data, and reputational impacts. In addition, despite efforts to detect unlawful intrusions, attacks can persist for an ex tended period of time before being detected, and following detection, it may take considerable time to understand the nature, scope, impact and timing of the incident. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. Repercussions of these incidents,  some  of  which  we  have  ex perienced  in  the  past,  could  include  litigation  or  cause  regulators  to  impose  significant  fines  or  other  remedial  measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.

Problems faced by us or our thirdparty 'cloud' computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\n## We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services ('AWS') provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a \"cloud\" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any commercial disputes related to, disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\n\n## If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own CDN. To the extent Internet Service Providers ('ISPs') do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we ex perience difficulties in our CDN's operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of 'bugs' or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain ex isting members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members' devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help counterbalance these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Privacy\n\n## Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and disclosure of member personal information could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our advertising offering, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members and third parties, which may include personal information and other data. We are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or 'GDPR') and the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act/CPRA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, have and could in the future lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, which to date have not been material but",

Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "The competitive pressure from cable companies influences both NFLX and VZ in distinct strategic ways. NFLX faces intensified competition from cable network operators and other traditional providers of entertainment video who are increasing their streaming offerings. These competitors have advantages such as large content libraries, strong brand recognition, and significant financial resources. This pressure forces NFLX to invest heavily in original programming to differentiate its service and retain members. However, if this original content does not meet expectations in terms of cost, viewing, or popularity, it could adversely impact NFLX's business and profitability. On the other hand, VZ competes with cable companies in both wireless and wireline services, particularly in bundled offerings that include wireless and connectivity services. This competition forces VZ to innovate and bundle services, which increases promotional and service plan discounting, potentially affecting its margins. Additionally, cable companies offering bundled wireless services through strategic relationships create a more complex competitive landscape, increasing the risk of customer churn and requiring VZ to invest in infrastructure and service enhancements to maintain its market position.",

        "Step 4: Extract from source B - Cable companies also compete with VZ in wireline services and bundled offerings, increasing churn risk and requiring infrastructure investment.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Both companies face competitive pressure from cable companies, but the impact manifests differently: NFLX must invest in content to retain users, while VZ must adapt its service bundles and infrastructure to retain customers."

In contrast, Verizon reported that none of its directors or officers adopted or terminated either a 'Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement' or a 'non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement' during the same period. This indicates that while both companies reported no activity related to non-Rule 10b5-1 arrangements, Netflix had active Rule 10b5-1 plans in place, whereas Verizon had no such trading arrangements of either type.",

      "answer": "Verizon provides internet access to consumers through FWA broadband (3.1 million connections as of December 31, 2023) and fiber-optic networks (Verizon Fios), which are essential for Netflix's service delivery. Netflix relies on consumers having unrestricted access to the internet to stream content. If Verizon, as a network operator, were to implement usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, or tiered internet access, Netflix could incur higher operating expenses and face challenges in member acquisition and retention. This creates a multi-hop dependency where Verizon\u2019s network policies directly affect Netflix\u2019s business performance and cost structure.",

      "answer": "Disney reports a concrete, quantified financial obligation of $75.7 billion in total contractual commitments, which includes creative talent and employment agreements among other programming and construction commitments. In contrast, Netflix does not provide a specific dollar amount for its creative talent agreements but instead describes them as noncancelable commitments under content obligations, which also include variable and undetermined future liabilities for unknown content titles. This indicates that while both companies rely on creative talent agreements, Disney provides a consolidated numerical figure that allows for direct financial analysis, whereas Netflix's commitments are more qualitative and contingent on future events, impacting the transparency and predictability of its financial obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

      "answer": "The Walt Disney Company (DIS) reported $75.7 billion in total contractual commitments for programming rights, including sports, films, and creative talent agreements as of October 1, 2022. Netflix (NFLX) disclosed that its content obligations, including non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements, could include an additional $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years for unknown future titles, with most payments expected after the next twelve months. The combined total of these specific non-cancelable creative talent-related obligations is approximately $77.7 billion to $80.7 billion.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2) Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n- (3) See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $366 million which has been included above. Total lease obligations as of December 31, 2021 increased $677 million from $2,839 million as of December 31, 2020 to $3,516 million as of December 31, 2021 due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $203 million, of which $39 million was classified in 'Other non-current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like share repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\n\n",

      "answer": "As of October 1, 2022, Disney's DTC services, including Disney+/Hotstar (164 million subscribers), ESPN+ (24 million subscribers), and Hulu (47 million subscribers), had a combined total of 235 million paid subscribers. Hulu is explicitly listed by Google in its 10-K filing as one of the key competitors in the digital video services market, alongside companies like Amazon, Apple, AT&T, ByteDance, Disney (directly mentioned), Meta, and Netflix. This indicates that Disney, through its ownership of Hulu and its own DTC platforms, represents a significant competitive force in the digital video services market, directly acknowledged by Google in its competitive analysis. The scale of Disney's subscriber base enhances its strategic positioning in the sector, contributing to its influence in competing against major technology and entertainment companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nDisney+ Hotstar is a subscription-based DTC service available in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Programming includes television shows, movies, sports and original series in approximately ten languages, in addition to gaming and social features. Disney+ Hotstar has exclusive streaming rights to cricket from the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), along with other cricket rights.\n\nStar+ is a standalone DTC service in Latin America with a variety of general entertainment content and live sports programming.\n\nDisney+ services use content from the Company's various studios, including library titles, as well as content acquired from third parties.\n\nThe majority of Disney+ revenue is derived from subscription fees. In addition, Disney+ Hotstar generates advertising revenue and Disney+ generates Premier Access fees. The Company plans to introduce an ad-supported Disney+ service in the U.S. in December 2022 and internationally starting in late 2023.\n\nAs of October 1, 2022, the estimated number of paid Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Star+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 164 million.\n\n## ESPN+\n\nESPN+ is a subscription-based DTC service offering thousands of live sporting events, on-demand sports content and original programming. ESPN+ revenue is derived from subscription fees, pay-per-view fees and, to a lesser extent, advertising sales. Live events available through the service include mixed martial arts, soccer, hockey, boxing, baseball, college sports, golf, tennis and cricket. ESPN+ is currently the exclusive distributor for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) pay-per-view events in the U.S. As of October 1, 2022, the estimated number of paid ESPN+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 24 million.\n\nHearst has a 20% interest in the Company's DTC sports business.\n\n## Hulu\n\nHulu is a subscription-based DTC service with general entertainment content from the Company's various studios as well as content licensed from third parties. Hulu's revenue is primarily derived from subscription fees and advertising sales. Hulu offers SVOD services with or without advertising in addition to a digital OTT MVPD (Live TV) service that is available with either of Hulu's SVOD services and, since December 2021, includes the Disney+ and ESPN+ DTC services. Hulu's Live TV service includes live linear streams of cable networks and the major broadcast networks. In addition, Hulu offers subscriptions to premium services such as HBOMax, Cinemax, Starz and Showtime, which can be added to the Hulu service. Certain programming from ABC, Freeform and FX Channels is also available on the Hulu SVOD service one day after airing on these channels. As of October 1, 2022, the estimated number of paid Hulu subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 47 million.\n\nThe Company has a 67% ownership interest in and full operational control of Hulu. NBC Universal (NBCU) owns the remaining 33% of Hulu. The Company has a put/call agreement with NBCU, which provides NBCU the option to require the Company to purchase NBCU's interest in Hulu and the Company the option to require NBCU to sell its interest in Hulu to the Company, in both cases, beginning in January 2024 (see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\n\n## Content Sales/Licensing and Other\n\nThe majority of Content Sales/Licensing revenue is derived from TV/SVOD, theatrical and home entertainment distribution. In addition, revenue is generated from music distribution and stage plays.\n\nThe Company also publishes National Geographic magazine and provides post-production services through Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound. These activities are reported with Content Sales/Licensing.\n\n## TV/SVOD Distribution\n\nAlthough we generally intend to use our film and television content on our DTC services and linear networks in TV/SVOD windows, we also license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services.\n\n## Theatrical Distribution\n\nThe Company licenses full-length live-action and animated films from the Company's Studio production groups to theaters globally. Cumulatively through October 1, 2022, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies.

Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.

Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

According to Disney's 2022 10-K filing, Hulu's costs rose from $6,680 million in 2021 to $7,564 million in 2022.

The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.\n\n## Advertising\n\nAdvertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad. In 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28% increase in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in all regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In 2024, the average price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The increase in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by an increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement tools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled \"-Executive Overview of Full Y ear 2024 Results.\" In addition, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and ad impressions delivered.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nFoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by WhatsApp Business Platform revenue.\n\n## Reality Labs\n\nRL revenue in 2024 increased $250 million, or 13%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to an increase in RL consumer hardware products sold.\n\n## Revenue Seasonality\n\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and 16% between the third and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17% compared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.",

As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For ex ample, European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators that provide services in their jurisdiction. Several European Union (EU) Member States have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. Rules governing new technological developments, including generative artificial intelligence, are nascent and rapidly evolving such that the impact on areas related to our business remains uncertain. For ex ample, in Europe, the Digital Markets Act remains subject to non-compliance investigations, the result of which could change how we interact with digital gatekeepers like Apple and Google. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional ex penses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, requiring payment of network access fees or payment of network support taxes, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the EU and several U.S. states. In others, the laws may be nascent, evolving or non-existent. For example, a U.S. federal appeals court recently overturned the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\n## We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, products, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically ex pensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities, and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Our advertising offering is new and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe have limited experience and operating history offering advertising on our service, and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to numerous claims, litigation, regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal proceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these matters are without merit and are vigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved adversely or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide to settle litigation, disputes, or other legal proceedings in some instances on terms that  are  unfavorable  to  us.  In  addition,  we  may  become  subject  to  orders  or  consent  decrees  imposed  by  government  or  regulatory  authorities.  Any  such developments  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs,  ex pose  us  to  civil  and  criminal  liability  (including  liability  for  our  personnel)  or  penalties  (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have experienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the past, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in light of complex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and advertiser base.\n\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving the company have increased, and there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid or limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to dismiss, including through the use of products liability theories. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in non-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining guidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the G eneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are facing inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe, including class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage) and/or injunctions in respect of alleged failings to comply with such regulatory requirements. We are also responding to litigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing or contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud, unlawful discrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people. This is in addition to significant tax , competition and antitrust, stockholder, commercial, consumer, and privacy litigation and investigations. Furthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential exposure to substantial damages awards and fines has increased.\n\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have not previously been enforced, or where the nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be very difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the nature and extent of injunctive or other non-monetary relief and the applicability and amount of any potential forfeitures, disgorgement, fines or penalties.  While we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can be no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our activities will not result from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\n\n## Privacy and Related Matters\n\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action.  On  December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors appealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state",

          "chunk_text": "\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV  series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n## Non-Income Taxes\n\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $400 million, which is expected to increase over time.",

      "question": "How do the anti-takeover provisions in both META's and NFLX's corporate structures differently affect their stock price attractiveness and investor protections, given META's dual class stock system and NFLX's classified board and preferred stock authorization?",
      "answer": "META's anti-takeover provisions center around its dual class stock structure, where Class B shares (primarily held by CEO Mark Zuckerberg) carry ten votes per share, giving him long-term control over corporate decisions and making META a 'controlled company' under Nasdaq rules. This structure discourages investor influence and could depress the trading price of Class A shares. Meanwhile, NFLX's anti-takeover mechanisms include a classified board of directors (until 2025), the ability to issue 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock without shareholder approval, and advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals. These provisions could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders might consider favorable. Both companies' structures reduce shareholder influence, but META's concentrated voting power directly limits investor protections more severely, while NFLX's mechanisms focus on procedural barriers to acquisition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From META's 10-K, extract the dual class structure details: Class B shares have ten votes per share, and CEO Zuckerberg holds a majority of voting power, allowing him to control outcomes of shareholder votes indefinitely.",
        "Step 2: From META's 10-K, note that as a 'controlled company,' META is exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, which could make its Class A stock less attractive to some investors.",
        "Step 3: From NFLX's 10-K, extract the anti-takeover provisions: classified board until 2025, 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, and advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: Both companies have Delaware anti-takeover provisions, but the mechanisms and implications differ. META's structure concentrates power in the CEO, limiting shareholder influence and investor protections. NFLX's mechanisms focus on procedural barriers to acquisition rather than concentrated control, making the impact on stock attractiveness different in nature."

We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\n\n## The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\n\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of our Class B common stock, including our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\n\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for ex ample, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\n\n## Our status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\n\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Accordingly, should the  interests  of  our  controlling  stockholder  differ  from  those  of  other  stockholders,  the  other  stockholders  may  not  have  the  same  protections  afforded  to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\n\n## Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware G eneral Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\n- until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\n- we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;",

Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\n## Our stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n- variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n- variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n- announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n- competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n- market volatility in general;\n- the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n- the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n- the operating results of our competitors; and\n- other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may ex perience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.\n\n## Preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the adsupported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the ex pectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the",
