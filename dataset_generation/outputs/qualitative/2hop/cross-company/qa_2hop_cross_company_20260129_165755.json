      "question": "How does the shift from term software licenses to subscription-based services impact the revenue recognition timing and volatility for CRM, and how does this contrast with Cisco's treatment of subscription revenue from term software licenses?",
      "answer": "CRM recognizes revenue from term software licenses at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer, leading to greater revenue volatility period to period. As CRM transitions customers from term licenses to subscription-based services, revenue will be recognized ratably over the contract term, which may result in less revenue in the initial period but more evenly distributed revenue over time. In contrast, Cisco includes revenue from term software licenses within its subscription revenue, which is recognized over time as part of ratable recognition, aligning with a more stable revenue pattern. This means that while CRM expects a shift toward less upfront revenue and more long-term stability, Cisco already accounts for such licenses within a broader, more consistent revenue model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CRM's filing, we learn that term software licenses are recognized at a point in time, causing greater volatility in revenue periods.",
        "Step 2: CRM also discloses that transitioning customers from term licenses to subscriptions will shift revenue recognition to a ratable model over the contract term, reducing upfront revenue but increasing long-term predictability.",
        "Step 3: Cisco's filing shows that term software licenses are included in subscription revenue, which is recognized over time, indicating a fundamentally different baseline treatment compared to CRM's transition strategy."

In contrast, Cisco (CSCO) recognizes revenue for term software licenses upfront upon transfer of control, providing more immediate financial visibility.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## Because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\n\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term.\n\n## If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.\n\nDue to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, including from the global economic impact of ongoing conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East; the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services; the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy; changing interest rates and inflation; the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from term software license sales; and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. We plan our expense and investment levels based on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our ex pectations, and unanticipated events may cause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to ex it certain obligations early. Additionally, if sales through indirect channels or for consumption-based product offerings increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting revenue and anticipated rate of growth. As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. If we are not able to provide continued operating margin expansion, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.\n\n## Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and global tax developments may impact our financial results.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our effective tax  rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax  rates, changes in operations, changes in non-deductible ex penses, changes in the tax effects of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding tax es, effects from acquisitions and changes in accounting principles and tax laws. Any changes, ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities.\n\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state, local or international tax  laws, changes in tax ing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, results of tax  ex aminations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, or changes to our business operations, including as a result of acquisitions. Any resulting increase in our tax  obligation or cash tax es paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.\n\nWe are also subject to tax examinations or engaged in alternative resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial position.\n\nAs our business continues to grow, increasing our brand recognition and profitability, we may be subject to increased scrutiny and corresponding tax disputes, which may impact our cash flows and financial results. Furthermore, our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile, and if perceived negatively, may cause brand or reputational harm.\n\nGlobal tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business, cash flows, or financial results. Such developments, for example, may include certain provisions introduced by certain Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's proposals including the implementation of the global minimum tax under the Pillar Two model rules, and the European Commission's and certain major jurisdictions' heightened interest in and taxation of",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Note  2  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\n\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software  licenses  are  distinct  performance  obligations  where  revenue  is  recognized  upfront  upon  transfer  of  control.  Term  software  licenses  include  multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\n\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n\nWe  assess  relevant  contractual  terms  in  our  customer  contracts  to  determine  the  transaction  price.  We  apply  judgment  in  identifying  contractual  terms  and determining  the  transaction  price  as  we  may  be  required  to  estimate  variable  consideration  when  determining  the  amount  of  revenue  to  recognize.  V ariable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n\n## Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\n\nInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales.

        "Step 1: From CRM's 10-K, we learn that term software license revenues are recognized generally upon transfer of control to the customer, and are part of the broader 'subscription and support revenues' category where revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term.",
        "Step 2: From CSCO's 10-K, we see that term software licenses are included in 'subscription revenue,' which also encompasses security software licenses, SaaS, and service arrangements, with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.",

The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company's marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investmentgrade securities and the Company's policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n\nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were 17 percent and 16 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were 81 percent and 82 percent of total assets, respectively.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 24 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2024, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 16 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company's enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, 'Cloud Services'), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n\n- identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\n\nSubscription and Support Revenues\n\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement.\n\nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company's subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\n\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available.

      "answer": "CRM recognizes term software license revenue ratably over the contract term, which results in a more gradual and stable revenue recognition pattern that aligns with the ongoing delivery of services. In contrast, CSCO recognizes revenue from term software licenses upfront upon transfer of control, leading to a more immediate recognition of revenue at the start of the contract term. This difference in timing affects their financial reporting strategies by influencing how each company presents revenue growth and stability: CRM's approach results in smoother revenue recognition over time, while CSCO's approach leads to more front-loaded revenue reporting, potentially creating more volatility in reported financial results across the contract lifecycle.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in revenue recognition timing for term software licenses between CRM and CSCO directly affects how each company reports revenue in its financial statements. CRM's ratable recognition leads to a more consistent revenue stream, while CSCO's upfront recognition results in higher initial revenue with ongoing maintenance revenue recognized over time."

Note  2  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\n\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software  licenses  are  distinct  performance  obligations  where  revenue  is  recognized  upfront  upon  transfer  of  control.  Term  software  licenses  include  multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\n\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n\nWe  assess  relevant  contractual  terms  in  our  customer  contracts  to  determine  the  transaction  price.  We  apply  judgment  in  identifying  contractual  terms  and determining  the  transaction  price  as  we  may  be  required  to  estimate  variable  consideration  when  determining  the  amount  of  revenue  to  recognize.  V ariable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n\n## Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\n\nInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales.

Texas Instruments (TXN) expects to receive between $7.5 billion to $9.5 billion through 2034, including up to $1.6 billion in direct funding for its fabs, and received $588 million in associated cash benefit in 2024.

          "chunk_text": "## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the table below, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken, including our Ireland SCIP transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2024 that resulted in $11.0 billion of net cash inflows to us (see \"Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; investments in our product roadmap; working capital requirements, including cash outlays associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan; partner distributions to our non-controlling interest holders; and strategic investments. We expect reductions in operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales after implementing our 2024 Restructuring Plan and related cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount, which are designed to enable further operational efficiency and agility and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing competitiveness. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, New M exico, and Oregon, and investing in a new leading-edge manufacturing facility in Ohio. They may also include longer-term projects, certain of which we have currently put on hold or slowed the completion of, including a new leading-edge manufacturing facility, a new assembly and test facility, and a new advanced packaging facility, among others.\n\nWe entered into government incentive arrangements with the US federal government pursuant to the CHIPS Act. In September 2024, we were awarded up to $3.0 billion in direct funding for the Secure Enclave program to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives pursuant to the CHIPS Act, and we received $1.1 billion of cash in 2024 and have received an additional $1.1 billion of cash in 2025. We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives, though recent US government actions create uncertainty as to the receipt of awards under our existing CHIPS A ct agreements and the potential for future awards in the US. These incentives typically require that we make significant capital investments in new facilities or expand existing facilities and our related workforce. To the extent we delay or cancel any such projects or otherwise are unable or fail to comply with the terms of the agreements, there may be a delay in our receipt of, or we may forfeit or be required to repay, the associated government incentives.\n\nWe expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. A s of December 28, 2024, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $14.0 billion for 2025 and had $6.0 billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term. A s of December 28, 2024, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2025 under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $2.1 billion, with an additional $4.9 billion committed in the long term.\n\nWe have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see: \"Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our SCIP arrangements and variable distribution payments that we expect to make to our co-investment partners, including liquidated damage provisions should we fail to meet certain construction milestones or operational metrics; \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply agreements structured as leases; \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our tax obligations, including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings; and \"Note 13: Borrowings\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by v endors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.\n\nWhen assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total cash and short-term investments as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Intel's transition to EUV lithography in 2024 significantly increased its capital expenditures, with 55% allocated to manufacturing facility space and 45% to equipment, as EUV lithography requires higher capital investment than previous technologies. In contrast, Texas Instruments maintains a competitive advantage by focusing on 300mm wafer manufacturing, which reduces the cost of unpackaged chips by approximately 40% compared to 200mm wafers, enabling lower manufacturing costs and greater supply chain control.",

A fter a process technology node is developed by our technology development group, we seek to shift production to one or more highvolume manufacturing facilities. M aintaining reliable production capacity is of critical importance. Wafer and packaging manufacturing facilities take a number of years to build, making it prudent to build space ahead of demand. We refer to this strategy as \"shell ahead.' A s a result of the supply shocks driven by the Covid19 pandemic and the projected growth of our products businesses, we set out to expand our capacity network beyond our existing wafer production facilities in Oregon (mostly utilized for technology development and early production on new nodes), A rizona, Ireland, and Israel to meet this demand and get to 'shell ahead' status. We are in the later stages of an expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in Ireland for our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes and undertaking a significant expansion of our Arizona facility for our upcoming Intel 18A  process node. We are building a new wafer production facility in Ohio and have plans for an additional new wafer production facility in Germany, but have slowed the completion of the Ohio facility and put the plans for the facility in Germany on hold as we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and sought to limit our capital expenditures given recent financial results. We have assembly and test facilities in Costa Rica, China, M alaysia, New M exico, and V ietnam. We are expanding our facilities in New M exico and M alaysia, though we recently reduced the extent of the expansion plans for M alaysia. We have plans for an additional assembly and test facility in Poland, but have put those plans on hold in conjunction with the delay of the facility  in Germany .\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing requires extremely sophisticated equipment, and we work closely with the tool vendors to align their roadmaps to our needs. In 2024, we made the transition from non-EUV lithography to EUV lithography with the Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes. EUV  lithography equipment drives a higher capital investment than the preceding lithography technology.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive industry. Over the past four years, we have made outsized investments across three categories-technology development, manufacturing facility shells, and advanced production tools-as we aim to catch up with our leading third-party manufacturing competitor on process technology, get to \"shell ahead\" for our and potential future foundry customer needs, and adopt EUV  lithography for our leading process nodes. In 2024, our manufacturing capital expenditures, inclusive of technology development, were distributed 55% in manufacturing facility space and 45% in equipment.\n\nTo moderate the impact to our balance sheet and cash flows, we've implemented what we call Smart Capital. Smart Capital includes maintaining a \"shell ahead\" on the longer lead time space and delaying tool purchases as long as possible ahead of high confidence demand signals while leveraging capital offsets from governments, financial partners, and customers.\n\nWe work closely with governments in the regions where we operate to obtain government incentives to support leading-edge semiconductor R&amp;D and manufacturing in those regions. Such incentives are often needed to offset the higher costs of operations in such regions, and support a more geographically balanced and risk-tolerant semiconductor supply chain. We worked closely with the US federal government on the implementation of the CHIPS A ct in support of the semiconductor industry and American technological leadership and innovation. In 2024, we signed an agreement with the US Federal Department of Commerce for the award of up to $7.9 billion in direct funding under the commercial CHIPS A ct program, which is designed to support leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the US, as well as an agreement under which we may receive up to $3 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS A ct's Secure Enclave program, which is designed to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. We also expect and have begun to benefit significantly from the A dvanced M anufacturing Investment Credit, given that the significant portion of our R&amp;D and manufacturing investments are made in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, as part of our SCIP program, we entered into an arrangement with A pollo in which we received a one-time capital infusion in exchange for an interest in the rights to operate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland. This follows our first SCIP agreement, with Brookfield, completed in 2022 and relating to our A rizona facility expansion. In total, we expect greater than $25 billion of capital offsets through these partnerships.\n\nFinally, as we build out our external foundry services, we expect to receive customer pre-payments to secure capacity and other benefits. Customer pre-payments are a standard practice for semiconductor manufacturers.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nOur supply chain is a cornerstone of our success and a critical enabler of our mission to deliver cutting-edge technology solutions to our customers. Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and operations, and sales and marketing. It encompasses thousands of suppliers worldwide, forming a robust supply ecosystem designed to enable product and process competitiveness, deliver industryleading total cost of ownership, and enable on-time, uninterrupted supply in a responsible and sustainable manner.\n\nOur global supply chain strategy is focused on driving a resilient, diverse, and responsible supply chain that meets the needs of our customers while upholding the highest standards of safety, quality, technology, availability, and sustainability. We work tirelessly across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and optimize capacity utilization and output to meet customer expectations.\n\nOur Capital\n\n9",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that competitiv e performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on sev eral factors, including the breadth of a company's product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innov ation, product dev elopment execution, technical support, customer serv ice, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that prov ide differentiated lev els of performance and a structural cost adv antage are competitiv e factors for our analog products, and customers' prior inv estments in software dev elopment is a competitiv e factor for our embedded processing products.\n\n## Market cycle\n\nThe 'semiconductor cycle' refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inv entories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inv entory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur rev enue is subject to some seasonal v ariation. Historically, our sequential rev enue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters.\n\n## Customers, sales and distribution\n\nWe sell our products to ov er 100,000 customers. Our customer base is div erse, with about half of our rev enue deriv ed from customers outside of our largest 50.\n\nWe market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and marketing team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Ov er the past sev eral years, we hav e been inv esting in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. In 2024, about 80% of our rev enue was direct, which includes TI.com. Our inv estments in new and improv ed capabilities to directly support our customers include order fulfillment serv ices, inv entory programs, business processes and logistics and website and e-commerce capabilities. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel adv antage and giv e us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access giv es us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n\nIn addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each dev ice on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial inv estments.\n\nWe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.\n\nWe invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitiv e adv antage prov ides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain, offering our customers geopolitically dependable capacity. We hav e focused on creating a competitiv e manufacturing structural cost adv antage by inv esting in our adv anced 300mm capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300mm wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200mm wafer.\n\nWe continue to inv est to strengthen our competitiv e adv antage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity plan to meet demand over time. Semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotiv e markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Progress and inv estments include:",

          "chunk_text": "## NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ntax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable  securities  are  determined  using  the  specific-identification  method  and  recorded  in  the  other  income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAll of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings.  For  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting,  changes  in  fair  value  are  recognized  in earnings.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable  securities,  and  accounts  receivable.  Our  investment  policy  requires  the  purchase  of  highly-rated  fixed income  securities,  the  diversification  of  investment  type  and  credit  exposures,  and  includes  certain  limits  on  our portfolio  duration.  We  perform  ongoing  credit  evaluations  of  our  customers'  financial  condition  and  maintain  an allowance for potential credit  losses. This  allowance  consists  of  an  amount  identified  for  specific  customers  and  an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out  basis.  Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing  and  packaging,  manufacturing  support  costs,  including  labor  and  overhead  associated  with  such  purchases, final  test  yield  fallout,  and  shipping  costs,  as  well  as  the  cost  of  purchased  memory  products  and  other  component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  or  for  obsolete  or  excess  inventory.  Most  of  our  inventory  provisions  relate  to  excess  quantities  of  products, based  on  our  inventory  levels  and  future  product  purchase  commitments  compared  to  assumptions  about  future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory  that  is  not  subsequently  written-up.  We  record  a  liability  for  noncancelable  purchase  commitments  with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization  of  assets  recorded  under  finance  leases.  Leasehold  improvements  and  assets  recorded  under  finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.",

Apple (AAPL) had vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements concentrated among a few vendors in Asia as of September 24, 2022, though no exact dollar amount is provided.

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated  sales  and  earnings,  and  generally  leads  the  Company  to  raise  international  pricing,  potentially  reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\n\nConversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and  resellers.  The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  services  directly  to  small  and  mid-sized  businesses  and  education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables  can  be  concentrated  within  cellular  network  carriers  or  other  resellers.  The  Company's  exposure  to  credit  and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade  and  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  as  well  as  long-term  prepayments,  there  can  be  no  assurance  such  procedures  will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\n## The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16",

Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $4.8 billion.\n\n## European Commission State Aid Decision\n\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the 'State Aid Decision'). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax  opinions  from  that  date  forward.  The  recovery  amount  was  calculated  to  be  \u20ac13.1  billion,  plus  interest  of  \u20ac1.2  billion.  The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the 'General Court'). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\n\nOn an annual basis, the  Company may request approval from the Irish Minister  for  Finance  to  reduce  the  recovery  amount  for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20ac12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted  recovery  amount  plus  interest  is  funded  into  escrow,  where  it  will  remain  restricted  from  general  use  pending  the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, 'Financial Instruments' for more information.\n\n## Note 6 - Leases\n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.\n\nPayments under the Company's lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases  of  output  of  the  underlying  leased  assets.

The  amount  is  classified  as  a  long-term  liability,  or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.\n\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and January 26, 2020, we had accrued $59 million, $44 million, and $31 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 30, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits of $670 million and the related interest and penalties of $59 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.\n\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.

      "answer": "Texas Instruments attributes 20% of its total revenue to personal electronics, a category that explicitly includes tablets among other devices. In contrast, Microsoft classifies tablets as part of its broader 'Product Revenue' segment, which encompasses hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming consoles, and related accessories. This shows that TI provides a more granular breakdown of tablet-related revenue within a\u7ec6\u5206 market, while Microsoft integrates tablets into a wider hardware category.",

The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for rev enue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price ('SSP') of performance obligations, v ariable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair v alue of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful liv es of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market v alue of, and demand for, our inv entory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achiev ed for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that hav e been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for inv estments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful liv es of our serv er and network equipment. Due to inv estments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our serv er and network equipment, as well as adv ances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful liv es of both serv er and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effectiv e beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Rev enue and expenses are translated at av erage rates of exchange prev ailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensiv e income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct rev enue includes sales from operating systems, cross-dev ice productiv ity and collaboration applications, serv er applications, business solution applications, desktop and serv er management tools, software dev elopment tools, v ideo games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent dev ices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other rev enue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that prov ide customers with software, serv ices, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting serv ices. Serv ice and other rev enue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.",

Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensiv e income. Fair v alue is calculated based on publicly av ailable market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an inv estment exceeds its fair v alue, we ev aluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair v alue is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers av ailable quantitativ e and qualitativ e ev idence. In addition, we consider specific adv erse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the inv estee. If we hav e plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recov ery, then a decline in fair v alue below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the inv estment is established. If market, industry, and/or inv estee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity inv estments with readily determinable fair v alues are measured at fair v alue. Equity inv estments without readily determinable fair v alues are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observ able changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternativ e). We perform a qualitativ e assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair v alue of the inv estment is less than carrying v alue.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges. More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.\n\nConversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. If we are unable to meet such increases in demand, this could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins'. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a customer's plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses. Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.\n\n## Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets.\n\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who develop competing products.\n\nIn addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection than us.\n\nThe actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",

      "answer": "ACN faces a potential increase of $371,000 in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months, largely tied to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Meanwhile, AVGO explicitly states that transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities, if successful, could result in adjustments to prior or future years' tax liabilities, directly impacting its earnings, results of operations, and cash flows. Both companies are under audit in multiple jurisdictions and emphasize the uncertainty surrounding tax authority determinations. Therefore, the upward movement in ACN's unrecognized tax benefits could signal increased scrutiny in areas that also affect AVGO, amplifying the risk that AVGO's tax liability could be materially different from its provisions, especially given the shared exposure to transfer pricing audits and regulatory uncertainty.",

        "Step 1: Extract from ACN's 10-K - ACN notes a potential increase of $371,000 in unrecognized tax benefits, primarily due to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from AVGO's 10-K - AVGO acknowledges that transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could result in material adjustments to its tax liability, affecting earnings and cash flows.",

An increase in ACN\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits may reflect broader regulatory trends or heightened scrutiny that could similarly impact AVGO\u2019s tax liability."

During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized expense of $25,369, $35,285 and $21,140 in interest and penalties, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $177,610 ($159,814, net of tax benefits) and $166,846 ($151,184, net of tax benefits) were reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nAs a global company, we file tax returns in multiple tax jurisdictions including the U.S. and Ireland. We have participated in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') Compliance Assurance Process ('CAP') program since fiscal 2016. CAP tax years are examined by the IRS on a contemporaneous basis so that most issues are resolved prior to filing the tax return. The years from fiscal 2021 forward remain open for examination by the IRS. The years from fiscal 2018 forward remain open for examination by the Irish tax authorities. We are currently under audit in numerous state and other non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. However, with limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to examination by those taxing authorities for years before 2014. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, we do not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $294,000 or increase by approximately $371,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations, tax audit activity and other adjustments. The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.",

Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.\n\nOur income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including:\n\n- reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, tangible and intangible assets, outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure;\n- jurisdictional mix of our income and assets;\n- changes in the allocation of income and expenses, including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure, acquisitions or tax law;\n- changes in U.S and foreign tax laws and regulations, changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, taxation of U.S. income generated from foreign sources, the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules;\n- tax effects of increases in non-deductible employee compensation; and\n- changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nWe have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services, the sale of products, the arrangement of financing and the grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm's length basis. Our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of comprehensive treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, result in adjustments for prior or future years. The effects of any such changes could subject us to higher taxes and our earnings, results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to, and are under, tax audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. The ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\n## Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was $41,218 million. This amount does not reflect any debt we expect to incur or assume in connection with the VMware Merger.\n\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\n- increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n- exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities, which we do not typically hedge against;\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry;\n- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n- making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and\n- potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.\n\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. While we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies, we may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could:\n\n- adversely affect the trading price of, or market for, our debt securities;\n- increase interest expense under our term facilities;\n- increase the cost of, and adversely affect our ability to refinance, our existing debt; and\n- adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt.",

      "answer": "Cisco leverages systems integrators as key channel partners to deliver managed network services and integrate its products into comprehensive solutions, particularly for enterprise and service provider markets. This is evident from Cisco\u2019s 10-K, which highlights that systems integrators typically provide system installation, technical support, and professional services in addition to selling Cisco products. In contrast, Qualcomm collaborates with systems integrators as part of a broader ecosystem to extend its wireless technologies\u2014such as 5G modems, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth\u2014into diverse markets like IoT and automotive. Qualcomm\u2019s 10-K notes that this collaboration helps manufacturers design and deliver devices that are optimized for performance and efficiency, leveraging Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon platform and RFFE components. The strategic importance of systems integrators for both companies lies in their ability to bridge the gap between advanced technology development and real-world deployment, enabling Cisco and Qualcomm to scale their offerings beyond direct sales channels and into increasingly complex, multi-vendor environments.",

We  sell  these  products through  a  network  of  third-party  application  and  technology  vendors  and  channel  partners,  as  well  as  selling  directly  to  these customers.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  commercial  market  represents  larger,  or  midmarket  and  small  businesses.  We  sell  to  our  midmarket  customers  through  a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity. Small businesses require information technologies and communications products  that  are  easy  to  configure,  install,  and  maintain.  We  sell  to  these  smaller  organizations  within  the  commercial  market primarily through channel partners.\n\n## Service Providers\n\nService  providers  offer  data,  voice,  video,  and  mobile/wireless  services  to  businesses,  governments,  utilities,  and  consumers worldwide. The service provider market includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, webscale operators as well as  Internet,  cable,  and  wireless  providers.  We  also  include  media,  broadcast,  and  content  providers  within  our  service  provider market,  as  the  lines  in  the  telecommunications  industry  continue  to  blur  between  traditional  network-based,  content-based  and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.\n\n## Public Sector\n\nThe public sector market includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector customers through a network of third-party application and technology vendors, channel partners, as well as through direct sales.\n\n## Sales Overview\n\nAs of the end of fiscal 2022, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 26,000 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Channel  partners  include  systems  integrators,  service  providers,  other resellers, and distributors.\n\nSystems  integrators  and  service  providers  typically  sell  directly  to  end  users  and  often  provide  system  installation,  technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.\n\nDistributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  related  to  our  sales  channels,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors  entitled 'Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins' and 'Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.'\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  relating  to  our  international  operations,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors entitled 'Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain",

Our one technology roadmap delivers the latest network technologies across multiple product tiers and devices. This roadmap is the result of extensive collaboration with manufacturers, operators, developers, systems integrators, cloud providers, tool vendors, service providers, governments and industry standards organizations, as well as our years of research into emerging network standards and the development of integrated circuits. Our roadmap takes advantage of new standards, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing standards. We have leveraged and expect to continue to leverage the foundational technologies initially developed and commercialized for use in mobile handset devices, such as our core baseband modem and processor technologies and our other wireless connectivity products including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning technologies, to extend into product categories, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT (which includes the industries and applications of consumer, industrial and edge networking).\n\nThe Snapdragon family of highly integrated, system-based solutions include the Snapdragon mobile, compute, sound and automotive platforms. Each platform consists of application processors and wireless connectivity capabilities, including our cellular modem that provides core baseband modem functionality for voice and data communications, non-cellular wireless connectivity (such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) and global positioning functions. Our Snapdragon application processor functions include CPU, security, graphics, display, audio, video, camera and AI. Our CPUs are designed to deliver high levels of compute performance with optimized power consumption. Our Qualcomm Hexagon\u2122 processors are designed to support a variety of signal processing applications, including AI, audio and sensor processing. Our Qualcomm Adreno\u2122 graphics processing units are designed to deliver high quality graphics performance for visually rich 3D gaming and user interfaces. In addition to the highly integrated core SoC, we also design and supply supporting components, including the RF transceiver, PM (power management), audio, codecs, speaker amps and additional wireless connectivity integrated circuits. These supporting components, in addition to our cellular modems and application processors comprising our core SoC, are also sold as individual components. The combination of the Snapdragon SoC, system software and supporting components provide an overall platform with optimized performance and efficiency, enabling manufacturers to design and deliver powerful, slim and power-efficient devices ready for integration with the complex cellular networks worldwide. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOur portfolio of RF products includes Qualcomm RFFE components that are designed to simplify the RF design for 5G frontend, LTE multimode and multiband mobile devices, including sub-6 GHz and mmWave devices, to reduce power consumption and to improve radio performance. We provide comprehensive RFFE product offerings with system level performance from the modem and transceiver to the antenna that include complex 4G/5G transmit and receive modules, power tracking, tuning systems, multimode-multiband power amplification, low noise amplifiers and mmWave antenna solutions, in addition to discrete filtering products, for devices and applications across the mobile handsets, automotive and IoT industries. We have also integrated our Snapdragon platform with our RFFE components to create our Snapdragon 5G modem-RF products, the world's first commercial modem-to-antenna 5G solution designed to maximize data speeds and performance, support superior call connectivity and coverage and extend battery life. \u00ae\n\nOur wireless connectivity products also consist of integrated circuits and system software for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and frequency modulation, as well as technologies that support location data and services, including GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, NavIC and BeiDou. Our wireless connectivity products provide additional connectivity for mobile devices, tablets, laptops, XR headsets, voice and music devices, wearable devices, along with other IoT devices and applications, automotive connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD, utility meters and logistic trackers and industrial sensors. QCT also offers standalone Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, fingerprint sensor, applications processor and Ethernet products utilized within these devices and systems. Our networking products include Wi-Fi, Ethernet and Powerline chips, network processors, wireless access points and routers, broadband gateway equipment and software. These products help enable home and business networks to support the growing number of connected devices, digital media and data services.\n\nOther than for certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products, QCT utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Therefore, we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers also are responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. The semiconductor package supports the electrical contacts that connect the integrated circuit to a circuit board. Die cut from silicon wafers are the essential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third parties for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements. The primary foundry suppliers for our various digital, analog/mixed-signal, RF and PM integrated circuits are Global Foundries, Samsung Electronics, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Our primary semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Amkor Technology, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATSChipPAC. The majority of our foundry and semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are located in the Asia-Pacific region.",

      "question": "How might constraints in semiconductor supply chains impact both Cisco's distribution model reliance on systems integrators and Qualcomm's product offerings, and what financial implications could this have for both companies' gross margins?",
      "answer": "Semiconductor supply constraints could increase manufacturing costs for Qualcomm's products, such as its Snapdragon platforms and RFFE components, which are critical for mobile, automotive, and IoT applications. This would directly affect Qualcomm's gross margins due to higher component pricing and potential delays in product delivery. Similarly, Cisco's distribution model relies heavily on systems integrators who may incorporate networking or infrastructure components using Qualcomm's semiconductors. If supply constraints lead to higher component costs or delays in availability, Cisco could face increased costs from inventory holding charges or sales deferrals, which would also negatively impact its gross margin. Both companies explicitly cite semiconductor supply constraints as a risk factor affecting their financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Cisco's distribution model relies on systems integrators, and semiconductor supply constraints are cited as a risk factor affecting gross margin through increased costs and inventory holding charges.",

          "chunk_text": "- Our ability to reduce production costs\n- Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development\n- Sales discounts\n- Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e. component costs, broker fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those currently impacting the market for components, including semiconductors and memory, and which costs have in the past and may continue to be exacerbated by inflation\n- Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges\n- Changes in shipment volume\n- The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals\n- Increased costs (including those caused by tariffs or economic conditions, including inflation), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering  does  not  correctly  anticipate  product  demand  or  if  the  financial  health  of  either  contract  manufacturers  or suppliers deteriorates\n- Lower than expected benefits from value engineering\n- Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China\n- Changes in distribution channels\n- Increased warranty or royalty costs\n- Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions\n- How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans\n\nChanges in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.\n\n## Sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition.\n\nSales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Secure, Agile Networks and Collaboration products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service provider product orders decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of  expanding  network  infrastructures;  the  availability  of  funding;  and  the  extent  to  which  service  providers  are  affected  by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result  of  any  slowdown  in  capital  expenditures  by  service  providers  (which  may  be  more  prevalent  during  a  global  economic downturn,  or  periods  of  economic,  political  or  regulatory  uncertainty),  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in  the  past,  many  of  our  service  provider  customers  have  been  materially  and  adversely  affected  by  slowdowns  in  the  general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability,  resulting  in  business  failures  and  substantial  reductions  in  spending  and  expansion  plans.  These  conditions  have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.  Finally,  service  provider  customers  typically  have  longer  implementation  cycles;  require  a  broader  range  of  services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\n\n## Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\n\nIf  we  fail  to  manage  distribution  of  our  products  and  services  properly,  or  if  our  distributors'  financial  condition  or  operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial  portion  of  our  products  and  services  is  sold through  our  channel  partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Our  channel  partners  include  systems  integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors.

The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' including the risk factor  entitled  'If  we  do  not  successfully  manage  our  strategic  alliances,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  from  such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.'\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity  in  newer  product  areas,  and  in  key  priority  and  growth  areas.  As  we  continue  to  expand  globally,  we  may  see  new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.\n\nOur  competitors  (in  each  case  relative  to  only  some  of  our  products  or  services)  include: Amazon  Web  Services  LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.; Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Ubiquiti Inc.; VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.\n\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.  As  we  expand  into  new  markets,  we  will  face  competition  not  only  from  our  existing  competitors  but  also  from  other competitors,  including  existing  companies  with  strong  technological,  marketing,  and  sales  positions  in  those  markets.  We  also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that  previously  were  segregated.  Due  to  several  factors,  including  the  availability  of  highly  scalable  and  general  purpose microprocessors,  application-specific  integrated  circuits  (ASICs)  offering  advanced  services,  standards-based  protocols,  cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\n\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with  price-performance  advantages;  the  ability  to  reduce  production  costs;  the  ability  to  provide  value-added  features  such  as security, reliability,  and  investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.\n\nWe  also  face  competition  from  customers  to  which  we  license  or  supply  technology  and  suppliers  from  which  we  transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.",

          "chunk_text": "significantly cut costs and other uses of cash, including in research and development, significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in next generation technologies. Further, depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstances above, we may have to reduce, suspend or eliminate our capital return programs, and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted. These challenges have required, and may in the future require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant legal costs.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITION\n\nOur revenues depend on our customers' and licensees' sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G, and customer demand for our products based on these technologies.\n\nWe develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies to drive consumer demand for new 3G/4G/5G multimode and single-mode devices, and to establish the selling prices for such devices. Further, the timing of our shipments of our products is dependent on the timing of our customers' and licensees' deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT, among others. Commercial deployments of 5G networks and devices have begun and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. However, the timing and scale of such deployments, in certain regions, have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and may be further delayed for reasons that are beyond our control.\n\nOur revenues and growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if: our customers' and licensees' revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies, and average selling prices of such products, decline due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions, including China; we do not continue to maintain our intellectual property and technical leadership in 5G, including in ongoing 5G standardization efforts; we are unable to drive the adoption of our products into networks and devices, including devices beyond mobile handsets; or consumers' rates of replacement of smartphones and other devices decline.\n\nOur industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.\n\nOur products and technologies face significant competition. Competition may intensify as our current competitors expand their product offerings, improve their products or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to maintain existing business and customers or attract new business and customers, as new opportunities develop, and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: OEM concentrations; vertical integration; competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention or support of national industries or competitors; the ability to maintain product differentiation in light of evolving industry standards and speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies and the demand for always on, always connected capabilities); access to capacity in the supply chain; and value-added features that drive selling prices and consumer demand for new 3G/4G/5G multimode and single-mode devices.\n\nWe anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. For example, if any key supplier of technologies and intellectual property to the semiconductor industry was sold to one of our competitors, it could negatively affect our ability to procure or license such technologies and intellectual property in the future, at all or upon acceptable terms which could have wide-ranging impacts on our business and operations.\n\nWe expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:\n\n- differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, RFFE, including millimeter wave (mmWave), graphics and other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive both performance and lower power consumption;\n- develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points and to effectively cover all geographic regions and all device tiers;\n- continue to be a leader in mobile, and drive the adoption of our technologies and integrated circuit products, including RFFE, into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices in mobile, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile computing devices;\n- increase or accelerate adoption of our technologies and products in industries and applications outside of mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT;",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's specific monetization of IoT devices through its QCT segment compare with Cisco's general involvement in IoT deployments, based on the financial data and strategic descriptions provided in their respective 2022 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm specifically monetized $6.948 billion from IoT devices through its QCT segment in 2022, representing a significant and growing portion of its business. In contrast, while Cisco mentioned its involvement in IoT deployments, it did not report specific revenue figures tied to IoT devices, indicating a more generalized or integrated approach to IoT across its broader product portfolio. This suggests that Qualcomm has a more direct and quantifiably substantial IoT monetization strategy, whereas Cisco's IoT involvement appears to be part of its wider networking and infrastructure offerings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, Qualcomm's 2022 QCT revenues include $6.948 billion specifically from IoT devices, showing clear and direct monetization.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, Cisco mentions supplying IoT deployments but does not provide a specific revenue figure for IoT devices alone, indicating a less segmented or more integrated approach.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both, Qualcomm's IoT involvement is quantified and product-specific, while Cisco's is strategic and infrastructural, without direct financial attribution."

      "answer": "Both AMD and NVIDIA are leveraging DPUs as a strategic differentiator in the data center infrastructure market, though with distinct approaches. AMD's P4 programmable Pensando DPUs are designed to offload infrastructure services from the host CPU, enabling optimization of performance for network, storage, and security services at cloud scale. This positions AMD as a provider of highly programmable and low-latency infrastructure solutions. On the other hand, NVIDIA expanded its data center platform to include DPUs starting in fiscal year 2022, integrating them into a broader stack of GPUs and CPUs to optimize computing, networking, and storage at data center scale. This reflects a full-stack approach to infrastructure optimization. The competitive positioning is evident in how each company integrates DPUs into their broader ecosystem\u2014AMD emphasizing programmability and offloading, and NVIDIA focusing on holistic data center-scale computing.",

      "question": "How does the differing exposure to generative AI applications in the Data Center segment between AMD and NVIDIA influence their respective revenue dynamics, given AMD's significant demand for AI accelerators in Q4 2023 and NVIDIA's platform-based expansion into generative AI for both cloud and PC markets?",
      "answer": "AMD experienced significant demand for its AI accelerators in the fourth quarter of 2023, indicating a growing role in generative AI applications within its Data Center segment. However, this growth is contingent on customer adoption of generative AI solutions. Meanwhile, NVIDIA has built a broader platform-based approach, integrating GPUs, networking, and software across cloud, hyperscale, on-premises, and edge data centers. NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment includes AI Enterprise software and DGX Cloud services, which support generative AI expansion both in enterprise environments and on PCs. This platform strategy allows NVIDIA to capture value beyond hardware, potentially leading to more sustained revenue growth compared to AMD's more hardware-dependent exposure to AI accelerators.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMD evidence - 'in the fourth quarter of 2023, we experienced significant demand for our AI accelerators' related to generative AI applications in the Data Center segment.",
        "Step 2: Extract from NVIDIA evidence - NVIDIA's Data Center platform includes AI Enterprise software, DGX Cloud service, and end-to-end networking, supporting generative AI across multiple environments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMD's exposure to generative AI is primarily through hardware (AI accelerators), while NVIDIA's platform-based approach spans hardware, software, and cloud services, creating a more diversified and potentially more sustainable revenue dynamic."

      "answer": "AMD faces specific risks related to operational continuity disruptions, administrative or technical problems, and difficulty maintaining effective internal controls due to its newly upgraded ERP system, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. In contrast, NVDA's phased ERP system upgrade includes quarterly evaluations of whether there are changes that materially affect internal control over financial reporting, suggesting a more cautious and iterative approach to mitigating risks associated with the upgrade.",

      "answer": "Salesforce highlights that changes in financial reporting standards could require them to reassess lease liabilities when significant events occur, which could materially affect their financial position and results. Texas Instruments notes that compliance with evolving financial reporting standards may impose costly efforts to control, assess, and report on metrics, particularly around ESG disclosures. While Salesforce focuses on the operational challenge of reassessing lease terms and liabilities upon significant events, Texas Instruments emphasizes increased compliance costs and restrictions on business operations due to more stringent reporting requirements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Salesforce mentions that changes in financial reporting standards may require reassessment of lease liabilities upon significant events, which could materially impact financial position and results.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Texas Instruments states that new financial reporting standards, particularly around ESG matters, may require costly efforts to control, assess, and report on metrics, and could impose greater compliance costs or operational restrictions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to financial reporting standards, but they face different operational challenges: Salesforce deals with lease liability reassessments, while Texas Instruments faces higher compliance costs and operational constraints due to ESG reporting."

      "answer": "CRM evaluates uncertain tax positions based on the likelihood of sustainability upon audit and recognizes the largest amount of benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. This affects its income tax provision through potential adjustments for interest and penalties. TXN, on the other hand, explicitly states that all $82 million of its uncertain tax positions at the end of 2023 would lower the effective tax rate if recognized. Therefore, while both companies face income tax audits and account for uncertain tax positions, TXN quantifies the direct impact on its effective tax rate, whereas CRM focuses on the recognition criteria and audit exposure without specifying a direct effective tax rate impact.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CRM's 10-K - CRM recognizes tax benefits of uncertain positions only if more likely than not sustainable upon audit and measures the benefit as the largest amount >50% likely to be realized.",
        "Step 2: Extract from TXN's 10-K - TXN reports $82 million in uncertain tax positions, all of which would lower the effective tax rate if recognized.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies are subject to income tax audits and must account for uncertain tax positions, only TXN explicitly ties the resolution of these uncertainties to a direct impact on the effective tax rate. CRM discusses the accounting mechanics but not the direct effect on the effective rate."

Salesforce disclosed that its ESG goals, including commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing diversity, are subject to risks such as the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG disclosures. The company noted that its processes and controls may not comply with new standards, which could result in significant revisions to its goals or reported progress. For Texas Instruments, the 2023 filing stated that as ESG reporting, diligence, and disclosure requirements expand in nature, scope, and complexity, the company may have to undertake costly efforts to assess, control, and report on ESG metrics. Therefore, both companies face increased operational and financial burdens, with Salesforce at risk of reputational and enforcement consequences if it fails to meet its aspirational goals, and Texas Instruments facing higher compliance costs due to the need for expanded ESG reporting infrastructure.",

      "answer": "Adobe utilizes Systems Integrators as part of a broader distribution network to deliver products and services to end users, alongside other channel partners like VARs, ISVs, and OEMs. In contrast, Cisco relies on Systems Integrators not only to sell directly to end users but also to integrate Cisco's products into comprehensive solutions, provide system installation, technical support, and professional services. This indicates that while Adobe incorporates SIs into its distribution mix, Cisco places a stronger emphasis on SIs for solution integration and end-to-end service delivery.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Adobe distributes certain products and services through a network that includes systems integrators ('SIs'), among other partners like VARs, ISVs, and OEMs.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Cisco's systems integrators typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to equipment sales, and they integrate Cisco's products into overall solutions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences: Adobe\u2019s use of SIs is part of a broader distribution model, while Cisco emphasizes SIs\u2019 role in solution integration and service delivery."

BUSINESS\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nFounded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified  software  companies  in  the  world. We  offer  a  line  of products and services used by creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats.\n\nWe market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service ('SaaS') model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors,  value-added  resellers  ('V ARs'),  systems  integrators  ('SIs'),  independent  software  vendors  ('ISVs'),  retailers, software  developers  and  original  equipment  manufacturers  ('OEMs').  In  addition,  we  license  our  technology  to  hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ('EMEA'); and Asia-Pacific ('APAC').\n\nAdobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000 and our website is www.adobe.com. Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from our website free of charge, as well as from the SEC website at www.sec.gov. The information posted to our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## OFFERINGS\n\nFor almost 40 years, Adobe's innovations have transformed how individuals, teams, businesses and governments engage and interact across all types of media. We deliver tools and services to empower individuals to create, collaborate and express their vision, transform businesses with compelling, personalized experiences in streamlined workflows and connect communities with new levels of collaboration.\n\nWhile we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services and solutions, we focus our investments in two areas of strategic growth:\n\nDigital Media. We provide products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and  promote  their  content  anywhere  and  accelerate  their  productivity  by  modernizing  how  they  view,  share,  engage  with  and collaborate on documents and creative content. Our Digital Media segment is centered around Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud, which include Creative Cloud Express, Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, Acrobat,",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Customers and Markets\n\nMany  factors  influence  the  IT,  collaboration,  and  networking  requirements  of  our  customers.  These  include  the  size  of  the organization,  number  and  types  of  technology  systems,  geographic  location,  and  business  applications  deployed  throughout  the customer's  network.  Our  customer  base  is  not  limited  to  any  specific  industry,  geography,  or  market  segment.  Our  customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector.\n\n## Enterprise\n\nEnterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multivendor environment. We offer service and support packages,  financing,  and  managed  network  services,  primarily  through  our  service  provider  partners.  We  sell  these  products through  a  network  of  third-party  application  and  technology  vendors  and  channel  partners,  as  well  as  selling  directly  to  these customers.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  commercial  market  represents  larger,  or  midmarket  and  small  businesses.  We  sell  to  our  midmarket  customers  through  a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity. Small businesses require information technologies and communications products  that  are  easy  to  configure,  install,  and  maintain.  We  sell  to  these  smaller  organizations  within  the  commercial  market primarily through channel partners.\n\n## Service Providers\n\nService  providers  offer  data,  voice,  video,  and  mobile/wireless  services  to  businesses,  governments,  utilities,  and  consumers worldwide. The service provider market includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, webscale operators as well as  Internet,  cable,  and  wireless  providers.  We  also  include  media,  broadcast,  and  content  providers  within  our  service  provider market,  as  the  lines  in  the  telecommunications  industry  continue  to  blur  between  traditional  network-based,  content-based  and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.\n\n## Public Sector\n\nThe public sector market includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector customers through a network of third-party application and technology vendors, channel partners, as well as through direct sales.\n\n## Sales Overview\n\nAs of the end of fiscal 2022, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 26,000 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Channel  partners  include  systems  integrators,  service  providers,  other resellers, and distributors.\n\nSystems  integrators  and  service  providers  typically  sell  directly  to  end  users  and  often  provide  system  installation,  technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.\n\nDistributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  related  to  our  sales  channels,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors  entitled 'Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins' and 'Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.'\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  relating  to  our  international  operations,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors entitled 'Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain",

      "answer": "If Systems Integrators face financial or operational challenges, both Adobe and Cisco could experience disruptions in their revenue streams. Adobe relies on Systems Integrators to deploy its Digital Experience solutions, which generated $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021. A disruption in this partner channel could hinder Adobe\u2019s ability to grow or maintain this revenue, especially since the company has made significant investments to scale this route to market. Similarly, Cisco explicitly states that a substantial portion of its products and services are sold through Systems Integrators, and any weakening in their financial condition or operations could adversely affect Cisco\u2019s revenue and gross margins. Therefore, a shared dependency on Systems Integrators means that financial instability in this connector entity could negatively impact both companies\u2019 top-line performance and margin stability.",

We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% yearover-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront's workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

Service provider product orders decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of  expanding  network  infrastructures;  the  availability  of  funding;  and  the  extent  to  which  service  providers  are  affected  by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result  of  any  slowdown  in  capital  expenditures  by  service  providers  (which  may  be  more  prevalent  during  a  global  economic downturn,  or  periods  of  economic,  political  or  regulatory  uncertainty),  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in  the  past,  many  of  our  service  provider  customers  have  been  materially  and  adversely  affected  by  slowdowns  in  the  general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability,  resulting  in  business  failures  and  substantial  reductions  in  spending  and  expansion  plans.  These  conditions  have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.  Finally,  service  provider  customers  typically  have  longer  implementation  cycles;  require  a  broader  range  of  services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\n\n## Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\n\nIf  we  fail  to  manage  distribution  of  our  products  and  services  properly,  or  if  our  distributors'  financial  condition  or  operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial  portion  of  our  products  and  services  is  sold through  our  channel  partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Our  channel  partners  include  systems  integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network",

This is supported by Adobe's 10-K, which states that the shift to SaaS combined with cloud computing has 'improved efforts to combat the pirating of our products.' In contrast, Cisco classifies SaaS as a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied over time, recognizing revenue ratably during the contract term as the customer consumes the service.

We develop our software internally, as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign intellectual  property  laws,  confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our  products  and  technology. Although  our  patents  have  value,  no  single patent  is  essential  to  any  of  our  principal  businesses.  We  have  also  registered,  and  applied  for  the  registration  of,  U.S.  and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile apps to users under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions  on  duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  under  'click through' or signed agreements containing restrictions on access and use. Our enterprise customers license our hosted offerings as SaaS or Managed Services.\n\nDespite  our  efforts  to  protect  our  proprietary  technology  and  our  intellectual  property  rights,  unauthorized  parties  may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-use software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nOur values-genuine, innovative, involved and exceptional-are built on the foundation that our people and the way we treat one another promote creativity, innovation and performance, which spur the Company's success. We are continually investing in our global workforce to further drive diversity and inclusion, provide fair and market-competitive pay and benefits to support our employees' wellbeing, and foster their growth and development. As of December 3, 2021, we employed 25,988 people, of which approximately 52% were in the United States and 48% were in our international locations. During fiscal 2021, our total attrition rate  was  12%. We  have  not  experienced  work  stoppages  and  believe  our  employee  relations  are  good.  Our  employee  listening program helps us understand employee sentiment on a wide range of topics throughout the employee lifecycle, providing insights that inform our decisions about employee programs, talent risks, management opportunities, employee networks and more. In fiscal year 2021, 76% of our employees participated in our most recent engagement survey.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nAdobe For All is our vision to advance diversity and inclusion across the Company. We recognize that everyone deserves respect  and  equal  treatment,  regardless  of  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  age,  disability,  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity,  cultural background or religious belief. As of December 3, 2021, women represented 33.8% of our global employees, and underrepresented minorities ('URMs', defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) represented 10.9% of our U.S. employees. To continue to improve employee representation, we have declared a set of aspirational goals for women in leadership positions globally, underrepresented minorities in leadership positions in the United States and overall Black representation.\n\nWe have a four-pronged strategy to grow the diversity of our workforce over time, on which we have continued to drive progress during fiscal 2021:\n\n- Pipeline : We help build the pipeline of future technical talent by encouraging young people of all backgrounds to learn  and  get  excited  about  software  coding  and  careers  in  tech.  In  fiscal  2021,  we  partnered  with  many  visionary organizations including Braven, BRIDGEGOOD, OneSchool and ScholarMatch.\n- Candidates : We source candidates from a variety of backgrounds and work to ensure fairness in our interview and hiring processes.

Note  2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  describes  the  significant accounting  policies  and  methods  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  accounting  policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions,  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  and  actual  results  could  differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\n\nThe  inputs  into  certain  of  our  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  considered  the  economic  implications  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, including the associated impact of supply constraints, on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2022. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together  with  other  resources  that  are  readily  available  and  whether  our  commitment  to  transfer  the  product  or  service  to  the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\n\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  in  exchange  for  those  products  or  services.  Transfer  of  control  occurs  once  the customer  has  the  contractual  right  to  use  the  product,  generally  upon  shipment,  electronic  delivery  (or  when  the  software  is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control,  with  the  associated  software  maintenance  revenue  recognized  ratably  over  the  contract  term  as  services  and  software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\n\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to  for  the  promised  goods  or  services  based  on  standalone  selling  prices  (SSP).  SSP  is  estimated  for  each  distinct  performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n\nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.",

      "question": "What is the combined revenue recognition timing difference between SaaS offerings and perpetual software licenses in both Adobe's cloud-based business model and Cisco's Secure, Agile Networks segment, and how does this impact their respective financial reporting strategies?",
      "answer": "Adobe recognizes SaaS revenue ratably over the contract term under subscription-based agreements, which improves anti-piracy efforts and supports a more predictable revenue stream. Cisco's SaaS arrangements in its Secure, Agile Networks segment also recognize revenue ratably over the contract term, whereas perpetual software licenses recognize revenue upfront upon transfer of control. This creates a timing difference in financial reporting: Adobe and Cisco both defer SaaS revenue recognition compared to the upfront recognition for perpetual licenses, aligning with their strategic shift toward recurring revenue models.",

We develop our software internally, as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign intellectual  property  laws,  confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our  products  and  technology. Although  our  patents  have  value,  no  single patent  is  essential  to  any  of  our  principal  businesses.  We  have  also  registered,  and  applied  for  the  registration  of,  U.S.  and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile apps to users under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions  on  duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  under  'click through' or signed agreements containing restrictions on access and use. Our enterprise customers license our hosted offerings as SaaS or Managed Services.\n\nDespite  our  efforts  to  protect  our  proprietary  technology  and  our  intellectual  property  rights,  unauthorized  parties  may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-use software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nOur values-genuine, innovative, involved and exceptional-are built on the foundation that our people and the way we treat one another promote creativity, innovation and performance, which spur the Company's success. We are continually investing in our global workforce to further drive diversity and inclusion, provide fair and market-competitive pay and benefits to support our employees' wellbeing, and foster their growth and development. As of December 3, 2021, we employed 25,988 people, of which approximately 52% were in the United States and 48% were in our international locations. During fiscal 2021, our total attrition rate  was  12%. We  have  not  experienced  work  stoppages  and  believe  our  employee  relations  are  good.  Our  employee  listening program helps us understand employee sentiment on a wide range of topics throughout the employee lifecycle, providing insights that inform our decisions about employee programs, talent risks, management opportunities, employee networks and more. In fiscal year 2021, 76% of our employees participated in our most recent engagement survey.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nAdobe For All is our vision to advance diversity and inclusion across the Company. We recognize that everyone deserves respect  and  equal  treatment,  regardless  of  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  age,  disability,  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity,  cultural background or religious belief. As of December 3, 2021, women represented 33.8% of our global employees, and underrepresented minorities ('URMs', defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) represented 10.9% of our U.S. employees. To continue to improve employee representation, we have declared a set of aspirational goals for women in leadership positions globally, underrepresented minorities in leadership positions in the United States and overall Black representation.\n\nWe have a four-pronged strategy to grow the diversity of our workforce over time, on which we have continued to drive progress during fiscal 2021:\n\n- Pipeline : We help build the pipeline of future technical talent by encouraging young people of all backgrounds to learn  and  get  excited  about  software  coding  and  careers  in  tech.  In  fiscal  2021,  we  partnered  with  many  visionary organizations including Braven, BRIDGEGOOD, OneSchool and ScholarMatch.\n- Candidates : We source candidates from a variety of backgrounds and work to ensure fairness in our interview and hiring processes. In fiscal 2021, we introduced a program called Hiring at Adobe that requires hiring managers to",

      "answer": "Adobe licenses its cloud products and services to users under 'click-through' or signed agreements, which restrict access and use, and the company emphasizes that its subscription-based model combined with cloud computing helps combat product piracy. This model enhances Adobe\u2019s ability to maintain recurring revenue and control over its intellectual property. In contrast, Oracle invests billions of dollars in acquiring complementary companies, products, and technologies\u2014such as its acquisition of Cerner in fiscal 2023\u2014to strengthen its cloud and infrastructure offerings. Oracle\u2019s hardware business, which includes cloud-related software and represented 6% of total revenues in fiscal 2023, is tightly integrated with its cloud strategy and is expected to benefit from continued R&D investment. Therefore, while Adobe focuses on a tightly controlled, subscription-driven cloud product ecosystem to secure revenue and reduce piracy, Oracle takes a capital-intensive approach by acquiring and integrating technologies to expand its enterprise cloud infrastructure footprint, creating distinct but competitive strategies in the broader cloud market.",

      "answer": "Adobe recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer, contributing to more immediate revenue recognition. In contrast, Oracle recognizes cloud license and on-premise license revenues upfront but also includes ratably recognized cloud services revenue over terms typically ranging from one to four years. This difference leads to Adobe reporting perpetual license revenue in alignment with product delivery, while Oracle spreads part of its license-related revenue over time, affecting the timing and pattern of revenue reported on their financial statements.",

        "Step 1: Adobe recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer, as stated in its revenue recognition policy.",

      "question": "How did Adobe and Oracle's borrowing activities under their respective Term Loan Credit Agreements reflect different approaches to liquidity management, and what do the total amounts borrowed indicate about their strategic financial planning prior to termination?",
      "answer": "Adobe did not borrow any amount under its Term Loan Credit Agreement before its termination, while Oracle borrowed a total of $5.6 billion under its Term Loan Credit Agreement before repaying and replacing it with a new agreement. Adobe\u2019s approach reflects a conservative liquidity strategy, maintaining the facility as a contingent source of funding without utilizing it, whereas Oracle actively leveraged its term loan to support its operations, indicating a more aggressive use of debt financing. The stark contrast in borrowing behavior highlights differing philosophies: Adobe prioritized financial flexibility with no drawn principal, while Oracle committed significant debt capacity to fund its strategic initiatives.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Adobe had a Term Loan Credit Agreement in place with no outstanding borrowings as of December 1, 2023, and it was subsequently terminated due to the Figma merger termination.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Oracle borrowed $4.7 billion under Term Loan 1 and $960 million under Term Loan 2, totaling $5.6 billion, before terminating the agreement on June 10, 2024, and entering into a new $5.6 billion term loan agreement.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adobe\u2019s zero utilization of the term loan indicates a precautionary liquidity posture, while Oracle\u2019s full draw suggests proactive capital deployment aligned with operational or strategic goals. The contrast in borrowing behavior reveals distinct financial strategies: one prioritizing optionality, the other leveraging debt capacity for execution."

      "answer": "Intel partners with CSPs to validate and deploy platform-enabling solutions, such as the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series and Intel Data Center GPU Flex Series, aiming to scale AI and HPC workloads through hardware-software integration. NVIDIA, on the other hand, leverages CSP partnerships to host and deliver its NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, which provide infrastructure and software for training and deploying AI models. These distinct approaches reflect Intel's focus on heterogeneous compute solutions and NVIDIA's emphasis on cloud-native AI services.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Intel partners with CSPs to enable platform validation and deployment, specifically mentioning the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series and Intel Data Center GPU Flex Series as part of their AI and HPC strategy.",

      "answer": "Intel collaborates with CSPs to validate and optimize its heterogeneous compute solutions, including Intel Xeon processors, FPGAs, GPUs, and AI accelerators, which helps drive workload-optimized performance and scalability. This partnership enables Intel to offer integrated hardware acceleration engines like Intel AMX for AI, Intel SGX for security, and Intel Crypto Acceleration, which are specifically designed to deliver performance and security benefits across diverse compute environments. NVIDIA also works closely with CSPs to optimize hardware and software infrastructure for generative AI and LLM training, offering pre-sales assistance and solution architecture support. However, Intel's broader portfolio of domain-specific accelerators and FPGAs, combined with CSP collaboration, allows it to deliver a more diversified and customizable compute platform, enhancing its differentiation and reach in the data center and AI markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Intel partners with CSPs to validate and optimize heterogeneous compute solutions including Intel Xeon processors, FPGAs, GPUs, and AI accelerators.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NVIDIA partners with CSPs to optimize hardware and software infrastructure for generative AI and LLM training, offering pre-sales assistance and solution architecture support.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Intel and NVIDIA collaborate with CSPs to enhance their platform adoption, but Intel's broader portfolio of domain-specific accelerators and FPGAs, combined with CSP collaboration, allows it to deliver a more diversified and customizable compute platform, enhancing its differentiation and reach in the data center and AI markets."

      "question": "How does the financial risk exposure from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) differ between Intel's platform validation partnerships and NVIDIA's service dependency concerns, based on their 2023 10-K disclosures?",
      "answer": "Intel's CSP relationships focus on platform validation partnerships that accelerate deployment of its heterogeneous compute solutions like the Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Data Center GPUs, which are critical to its $X billion data center revenue stream. In contrast, NVIDIA explicitly cites financial risk in its 2024 operating expenses from potential CSP service interruptions that could impair product delivery, particularly for its networking products which represent a significant portion of its $Y billion annual revenue. While Intel emphasizes CSPs as enablers of growth through validation support, NVIDIA quantifies CSP dependency risks through potential disruptions to its product development cycle and service provision capabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Intel's 10-K shows CSPs are explicitly named as validation partners accelerating deployment of Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Data Center GPUs, which are central to its data center strategy.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NVIDIA's 10-K names CSPs as critical third parties whose service interruptions could directly impair its ability to provide products and services, with specific mention in operating expense disclosures for fiscal 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Intel positions CSPs as growth enablers through platform validation, while NVIDIA identifies CSPs as risk vectors that could disrupt product development cycles and service delivery, with explicit financial exposure in operating expenses."

      "answer": "Intel faces significant risk of impairment on its non-marketable investments due to the potential failure of private companies in which it invests, which could lead to a total loss of investment. This is in contrast to NVIDIA, which reported $174 million in net unrealized gains on non-marketable investments in fiscal year 2024, indicating that the companies in which NVIDIA invested were performing better during that period.

      "question": "How does the geographic diversification of IBM's operations, as reflected in its exposure to currency fluctuations, compare to Salesforce's currency risk profile, and what specific international operational characteristics contribute to these differences?",
      "answer": "IBM faces currency risks from its significant percentage of revenues and costs derived from affiliates operating in local currency environments, with exposure to changes in relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. This is compounded by IBM's operations in over 175 countries, creating extensive foreign exchange risk. In contrast, Salesforce's currency risk is specifically tied to its international expansion efforts and integration of foreign acquisitions, which brings challenges related to financial resource division, regulatory risks, and operational complexities across different languages, cultures, and political environments. The difference in scale (IBM's global presence in 175+ countries vs. Salesforce's acquisition-driven international operations) and nature of international engagement (organic multinational operations vs. integration of acquired entities) creates distinct currency risk profiles for each company.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Salesforce's currency risks are specifically tied to 'foreign countries' entry challenges including 'regulatory risks,' 'division of financial resources,' and operational complexities across 'different languages, cultures, and political environments' due to acquisitions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - IBM's currency risks stem from 'a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments' with exposure to 'changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar,' compounded by its presence in 'more than 175 countries.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The comparison reveals distinct international operational characteristics: IBM's risk arises from its vast organic multinational footprint (175+ countries) and local currency exposures, while Salesforce's risk is acquisition-driven with emphasis on integration challenges across cultural, regulatory, and financial dimensions."

      "answer": "IBM's hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, delivered through its strategic partnership with Salesforce, directly help address competitive threats Salesforce faces from cloud computing development platform companies that allow customers to build new apps on current infrastructure or as hosted services. According to Salesforce's 10-K filing, these platform companies represent a competitive threat because they enable customers to develop enterprise applications for internal use or host services without relying on Salesforce's offerings. IBM combats this by providing complementary hybrid cloud and AI technology that supports Salesforce's digital transformation initiatives and helps modernize applications. This partnership enhances Salesforce's value proposition by combining IBM's deep technological expertise and incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure with Salesforce's service offerings, making it more difficult for generic cloud development platforms to displace Salesforce in the market.",

        "Step 1: From CRM's filing, identify the competitive threat from 'cloud computing development platform companies' that could displace Salesforce by enabling customers to build apps internally or as hosted services.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize how IBM's hybrid cloud and AI capabilities strengthen Salesforce's position against the identified competitive threat by enhancing their joint value proposition and supporting Salesforce's digital transformation initiatives."

Similarly, IBM relies on open-source code maintained by independent communities, and if this code is no longer maintained or enhanced, IBM may be unable to develop new technologies or meet customer innovation demands.

      "answer": "Accenture's partnership with Databricks provides Accenture with a strategic advantage by integrating Databricks' data and AI capabilities into its consulting and technology services, enabling clients to accelerate digital transformation. This is significant because Microsoft, a key competitor to Databricks in the database, business intelligence, and data warehousing space, also competes with Accenture in enterprise services. Accenture's collaboration with Databricks allows it to differentiate its offerings in a market where Microsoft is both a competitor and a technology partner, thereby enhancing Accenture\u2019s ability to deliver comprehensive data-driven solutions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Accenture has a strong ecosystem relationship with Databricks and other leading technology providers, which enhances its service offerings and delivers distinctive business value to clients.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Accenture\u2019s partnership with Databricks strengthens its competitive position in the data and AI services market, even as Microsoft competes with both companies in overlapping domains, creating a nuanced multi-hop relationship of partnership and competition."

      "answer": "Accenture invested $1.2 billion in R&D in fiscal 2024, specifically targeting its assets, platforms, and industry and functional solutions. This investment is part of a broader strategy to enhance differentiation and competitiveness by building organic capabilities. In contrast, Microsoft focuses on Industry Solutions through professional services and acquisitions, such as Nuance, to deliver tailored AI and ambient intelligence offerings for enterprise clients. Microsoft also competes in this space by offering integrated cloud and AI solutions, security, and hybrid infrastructure capabilities. The difference in approach suggests that Accenture is prioritizing internal innovation and talent development to drive client transformation, while Microsoft is leveraging both internal development and external partnerships/acquisitions to strengthen its industry-specific offerings. This divergence reflects two paths to competitiveness in enterprise technology services: Accenture through organic R&D and Microsoft through integrated service delivery and strategic asset acquisition.",

      "answer": "Accenture's partnership with Snowflake enhances its data and AI capabilities by integrating Snowflake's cloud data platform into Accenture's technology offerings, allowing Accenture to deliver more robust and scalable data-driven solutions to clients. This strengthens Accenture's ability to differentiate itself in the market, particularly in data and AI services, where Microsoft is a major competitor through its Azure platform and data warehousing solutions. Microsoft, in turn, competes directly with Snowflake by offering its own data warehousing and analytics services, which are part of a broader portfolio that includes Azure and AI tools. Therefore, Accenture's alignment with Snowflake indirectly supports its competitive stance against Microsoft by bolstering its service offerings with a leading data platform, while Microsoft seeks to displace Snowflake by promoting its own competing solutions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Accenture explicitly lists Snowflake as a key technology partner in its ecosystem, which it leverages to deliver distinctive business value and enhance its data and AI capabilities.",

Cybersecurity\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nSafeguarding data and systems is one of our most important responsibilities in building and maintaining trust, not only with our people but also with our clients and other stakeholders. Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management system and is supported by controls, policies and processes implemented across the enterprise and is designed to protect our network/technical infrastructure and the data of A ccenture, our clients and our people. Our internal cybersecurity team collaborates closely with our information technology team and A ccenture Security, a leading provider of end-to-end cybersecurity services, including strategy, protection, resilience and industry-specific cyber services, to continually innovate security solutions intended to address the evolving threat landscape.\n\nOur security framework leverages a hybrid set of internationally recognized standards, including but not limited to, ISO 27001/27701, NIST Cyber Security Framework, CSA Security Trust and Assurance Registry, and CIS Critical Security Controls. We regularly measure our security posture and resilience through risk assessments, penetration testing and external validation conducted by third-party assessors and auditors. Threat intelligence sources, including those provided by Accenture Security, are also used to inform our security strategy, understand the threat landscape, and enable security risk and procedures to be integrated into the business. Our key strategic security programs include secure integration of acquisitions and supplier cyber risk management. We utilize systems and processes designed to oversee, identify, and reduce the potential impact of cybersecurity incidents at third-party vendors, service providers or clients.\n\nOur infrastructure vulnerability scanning and configuration compliance approach includes real-time threat detection and monitoring of threats via our security information and event management and endpoint detection and response tools to respond to security incidents at speed. We monitor for secure configuration of servers, network devices, containers and other cloud services, evaluate risks in new programs, and regularly review and strengthen our security controls.\n\nProtecting client data is a top business priority supported by our global client data protection (CDP) program. A  CDP plan is developed for our clients and is designed to provide end-to-end security risk management covering physical, application, infrastructure, and data security. The CDP program also arms our project teams with tools and controls that enable them to identify and mitigate security risks over the lifecycle of a client project. A ccenture leadership reviews and monitors CDP monthly metrics, which are intended to provide oversight and accountability.\n\nAll A ccenture people complete annual core information security and data privacy training, delivered in multiple courses throughout the year, to stay up-to-date on security practices and threats. In addition, our people in internal- and client-data-sensitive roles complete specialized, targeted security training to increase knowledge about role-specific threats, concepts and practices. These interactive learning programs are focused on strengthening foundational knowledge and responding to emerging threats. A gile and flexible, our training program has garnered industry recognition for its innovative approach and effectiveness.\n\nIn the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have robust playbooks to guide our incident procedures. These procedures provide a standardized framework for responding to cybersecurity incidents and include taking action to limit and contain the spread of the incident within our environment, analyzing whether and the extent to which any data may have been compromised and conducting forensic analysis to determine severity. We also have internal and external reporting and communication plans that address reporting findings and keeping senior management and other key stakeholders informed and involved as appropriate. Once an incident is resolved, a comprehensive post-incident review process is conducted.\n\nWe describe the risks from cybersecurity threats, including previous cybersecurity incidents, in Part I, Item 1A . Risk Factors - 'We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or A ccenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks'. To date these risks and incidents have not had a material impact on us, including our business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving, becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nOur enterprise risk management program is an annual and ongoing process designed to identify, assess and manage Accenture's risk exposures over the short-, intermediate- and long-term. Our enterprise risk management program and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the Board of Directors, as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure.

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1C\n\nWhen appropriate, we utilize external serv ice prov iders to assess, test, or otherwise assist our program. We also lev erage third parties by working with external researchers, operating bug bounty programs, and managing coordinated v ulnerability disclosure programs with security organizations. We maintain a systematic approach to assessing and controlling the cybersecurity risks presented by third-party serv ice prov iders. We require third-party serv ice prov iders to manage their cybersecurity risks in defined ways, undergo cybersecurity rev iews, notify us of cyber ev ents, and satisfy additional contractual requirements.\n\nWe seek to improve the entire cybersecurity ecosystem through multistakeholder diplomacy to set and uphold expectations for state behav ior, advancement of government policy that strengthens cybersecurity and resiliency, disruption and deterrence of cybercrime, protection of national security interests, and disruption of digital threats to democracies. We also establish processes and innov ate solutions for us and our customers to address the growing number and complexity of cybersecurity regulations.\n\nWhen we experience a cybersecurity incident, we utilize our well-established incident response plans that operate both across the company and at the product and serv ices lev el. Incidents are first triaged for sev erity, and then more deeply assessed to establish a plan of record and activ ate internal and external notification, disclosure, and communication plans, as applicable. Engineering and dev elopment resources are mobilized to resolv e or remediate the incident. After the incident is resolv ed, a comprehensiv e post-incident rev iew process is conducted.\n\nWe describe the risks from cybersecurity threats, including prev ious cybersecurity incidents, in section 'Risk Factors' (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10K). As of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not believ e any risks from cybersecurity threats hav e materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our results of operations or financial condition. Howev er, the cybersecurity threat env ironment is increasingly challenging, and we, along with the entire digital ecosystem, are under constant and increasing threat. As discussed abov e, our business strategy is tied to the SFI and we are committed to continuously monitoring cybersecurity threats, enhancing the security of our products, inv esting in our cybersecurity infrastructure, and collaborating with peers, customers, serv ice prov iders, regulators, and gov ernments to adv ance our and the entire digital ecosystem's cybersecurity defenses and resiliency.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nOur Board of Directors ov ersees cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity rev iews by the Board are scheduled to occur at least quarterly, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or adv isable. Presentations to the Board of Directors are made by senior management, including our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), our EVP of Microsoft Security, and the head of our Customer Security and Trust organization. The presentations address topics such as cybersecurity threats, incidents, top risks and related remediation efforts, results from internal and third-party assessments, progress towards risk-mitigation goals, the functioning of our incident response program, regulatory dev elopments, and digital diplomacy efforts. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of significant issues. Cybersecurity issues are also considered during separate Board meeting discussions regarding important matters like ERM, audit issues, operational budgeting, business continuity planning, mergers and acquisitions, brand management, and other relev ant matters.\n\nOur CISO leads the strategy, engineering, and operations of cybersecurity across the company, and reports to the EVP of Microsoft Security. Our CISO has extensiv e experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Before joining Microsoft, our CISO serv ed in a prior Chief Technology Officer role as well as in senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles within multiple organizations. In addition to the Board's oversight of cybersecurity risk, to support the CISO, we hav e established a Cybersecurity Gov ernance Council ('CGC') charged with ov erseeing initiativ es that safeguard Microsoft's infrastructure. The CGC is comprised of an executiv e-lev el team of Deputy CISOs with cybersecurity backgrounds and expertise relev ant to their roles. The CGC responsibilities include approv ing our enterprise security risk assessment process and results, determining the appropriate cybersecurity risk lev el and mitigations, rev iewing the NIST CSF alignment, and supporting compliance with cybersecurity regulations. Our cybersecurity efforts are supported directly by Microsoft's security and threat intelligence experts and our employees across the company, all of whom receiv e cybersecurity awareness training and education and are expected to support our efforts.",

Oracle Corporation, in contrast, provides a full suite of enterprise IT solutions, including applications and infrastructure technologies, delivered through on-premise, cloud-based, and hybrid deployment models.

      "answer": "Oracle places a significant strategic emphasis on enterprise infrastructure, with 54% of its cloud services and license support revenues tied to infrastructure technologies, including enterprise servers, storage solutions, and related support services. This highlights Oracle's focus on providing comprehensive, enterprise-grade infrastructure solutions for cloud-based, on-premise, and hybrid IT environments. In contrast, Texas Instruments reports enterprise systems as only 4% of its revenue, indicating a much smaller strategic focus on this segment compared to Oracle.

      "question": "How do Oracle's (ORCL) and Texas Instruments' (TXN) exposures to market access regulations differ in terms of their potential financial impact on international operations, considering Oracle's mention of a 15% global minimum tax and Texas Instruments' reference to trade-related compliance costs?",
      "answer": "Oracle faces potential financial impacts from market access regulations through the imposition of a 15% global minimum tax, which could materially increase its international income tax liabilities. Texas Instruments, on the other hand, faces financial exposure through increased compliance costs related to trade regulations, including tariffs and import/export rules, which could restrict its ability to manufacture or ship products internationally. These differing exposures illustrate how both companies are affected by market access regulations in distinct financial dimensions: Oracle through tax liabilities and TXN through operational compliance costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Oracle mentions that the OECD and G20 two-pillar framework calling for a 15% global minimum tax could materially increase the level of income tax on its international profits.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Texas Instruments states that compliance with international trade regulations, including tariffs and import/export rules, increases its cost of doing business and could restrict its ability to manufacture or ship products.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to market access regulations, but the financial impact manifests differently: Oracle faces increased tax liabilities due to international tax reforms, while Texas Instruments faces higher operational costs and potential restrictions on product movement."

      "answer": "Oracle's cloud and on-premise license sales are affected by trade policies through reduced corporate IT spending due to economic uncertainty, while Texas Instruments experiences direct margin pressure from tariffs on imported materials and products. Oracle notes that trade policy instability could lead customers to delay or cancel purchases of its cloud and on-premise license products. In contrast, Texas Instruments explicitly states that tariffs directly affect its profit margins, which vary due to factors like customer demand, product mix, and trade-related costs including tariffs.",

According to TXN's filing, if these liabilities are recognized, they would lower the effective tax rate.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBusiness Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.\n\nCritical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are:\n\n- future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;\n- historical and ex pected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n- assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;\n- discount rates;\n- uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed;\n- fair value of assumed equity awards; and\n- fair value of pre-ex isting relationships.\n\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n\nIncome Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient tax able income of the appropriate character, for ex ample, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax  law. We regularly review the deferred tax  assets for recoverability based on historical tax able income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of ex isting temporary differences and tax  planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully ex ecute our business plans and tax  planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax  assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\n\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax  jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax  benefit of an uncertain tax  position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax ing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax  benefits in our income tax  provision.\n\nStrategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and these valuations require our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value for these investments, we utilize the most recent data available and apply valuation methods, including the market approach and option pricing models ('OPM'), adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the classes of securities we hold. Such information available to us from investee companies is supplemented with estimates such as volatility and expected time to liquidity.\n\nWe assess the privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio for impairment quarterly. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. Depending on our contractual rights as an investor, investee specific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statements of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.\n\n## Results of Operations",

The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates.\n\nThe Company grants performance share awards to executive officers and other members of senior management, which may include a market condition, a performance condition, or both. Stockbased compensation expense related to awards with a market condition are measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the expense related to these awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a performance condition are measured based on the grant date closing stock price and the expense related to these awards is recognized based on the requisite service period elapsed, as well as the probability of achievement and estimated attainment of the performance condition as of the end of our reporting period.\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to the Company's Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ('ESPP' or '2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan') is measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a 15 percent discount from the lower of the Company's stock price on (i) the first day of the offering period or on (ii) the last day of the purchase period. The ESPP also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a six -month purchase period (December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not to increase that election until the nex t one-year offering period. The ESPP includes a reset provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date.\n\nThe Company, at times, grants unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment. Therefore, the Company accounts for them as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards, based on the closing stock price on grant date, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years.\n\n## Advertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company's tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax  benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax ing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.\n\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax  assets ultimately depends on the ex istence of sufficient tax able income of the appropriate character (for ex ample, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future tax able income, the ex pected timing of the reversals of ex isting temporary differences and tax  planning strategies. The Company's judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully ex ecute its business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax  assets, the tax  provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe functional currency of the Company's major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates.

The Company had California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $480 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2029 through fiscal 2045, California research and development tax credits of approximately $932 million, which do not expire. For other states' income tax purposes, the Company had tax credits of approximately $75 million, which expire beginning in fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2034, and insignificant net operating loss carryforwards. Utilization of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.\n\nThe Company had a valuation allowance of $786 million and $733 million as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax  assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of ex isting deferred tax  liabilities, projected future tax able income, as well as prudent and feasible tax -planning strategies. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable jurisdictions. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to state tax  credits and certain U.S foreign tax credits that are not ex pected to be realized. At the end of January 31, 2025, the valuation allowance was primarily related to U.S. states' net operating loss and tax  credits and certain U.S foreign tax credits. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets.\n\n## Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations\n\nThe Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax  positions. Tax  positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax  audits by multiple tax  jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon ex amination by the tax ing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax  benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax ing authority.",

          "chunk_text": "## Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities\n\nThe Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-forsale  debt  securities  are  reported  at  fair  value  with  the  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  included,  net  of  tax,  in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss),  a  component  of  stockholders'  equity.  If  an  available-for-sale  debt security's fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets.  Estimated  useful  lives  of  equipment  is  two  to  six  years,  and  leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements.\n\n## Leases\n\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets  and  liabilities  are  initially  recognized  based  on  the  present  value  of  lease  payments  over  the  lease  term.  In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated  group  incremental  borrowing  rate  for  all  leases  as  the  Company  has  centralized  treasury  operations. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has  elected  the  accounting  policy  to  not  recognize  ROU  assets  and  lease  liabilities  that  arise  from  short-term  (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company's finance leases are immaterial.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions\n\nThe  functional  currency  of  all  of  the  Company's  foreign  subsidiaries  is  the  U.S.  dollar.  Assets  and  liabilities denominated  in  non-U.S.  dollars  have  been  remeasured  into  U.S.  dollars  at  current  exchange  rates  for  monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales  and  expense  transactions  related  to  non-monetary  balance  sheet  amounts  which  have  been  remeasured  at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings.\n\n## Marketing and Advertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company's marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as  a  reduction  of  revenue.  Total  marketing  and  advertising  expenses  for  2021,  2020  and  2019  were  approximately $578 million, $314 million and $217 million, respectively.",

We use the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment.\n\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-ofuse ('ROU') assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months, and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the effects of collateral. Operating and finance lease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on the effectiveinterest method over the lease term.\n\nFair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\n\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurements are described below:\n\nLevel 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, banker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds. We measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.\n\nLevel 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired. Quantitative information for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and financial indicators of the investee's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technology obsolescence rates, expected costs to develop in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.",

          "chunk_text": "## Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1 - The Company\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company. References herein to AMD or the Company mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. AMD's products include x86 microprocessors (CPUs), as standalone devices or as incorporated into accelerated processing units (APUs), chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), data center and professional GPUs, server and embedded processors, semi-custom SoC products, microprocessor and SoC development services and technology for game consoles. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\n\n## NOTE 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nFiscal Year . The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 ended on December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 each consisted of 52 weeks.\n\nPrinciples  of  Consolidation. The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  Company's  accounts  and  those  of  its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nReclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n\nUse  of  Estimates. The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  commitments  and  contingencies  at  the  date  of  the  financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to  differ  from  those  estimates,  and  such  differences  may  be  material  to  the  financial  statements.  Areas  where management  uses  subjective  judgment  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  revenue  allowances,  inventory  valuation, valuation and assessing potential impairment, if any, of goodwill and deferred income taxes.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping  and  handling  costs  associated  with  product  sales  are  included  in  cost  of  sales.  Substantially  all  the Company's revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.\n\n## Non-custom products\n\nThe Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single performance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.\n\nThe Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based  incentives  and  special  pricing  arrangements.  Where  funds  provided  for  such  programs  can  be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to  perform  specific  product  advertising  or  marketing  and  promotional  activities,  such  amounts  are  recognized  as  a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\n\nConstraints of variable consideration have not been material.",

The prolonged effect of COVID-19 could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, security and stability, brand recognition and availability.\n\nWe  expect  that  competition  will  continue  to  be  intense  due  to  rapid  technological  changes,  frequent  product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing  by  competitors,  especially  during  challenging  economic  times.  In  addition,  our  competitors  have  significant marketing  and  sales  resources  which  could  increase  the  competitive  environment  in  a  declining  market,  leading  to lower  prices  and  margins.  Some  competitors  may  have  greater  access  or  rights  to  complementary  technologies, including  interface,  processor  and  memory  technical  information.  For  instance,  with  our  APU  products  and  other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel is seeking to expand its position in integrated graphics for  the  PC  market  with  high-end  discrete  graphics  solutions  for  a  broad  range  of  computing  segments,  which  may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments. We also face competition from companies that use competing computing architectures and platforms like  the ARM architecture.  Increased  adoption  of ARM-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  entering  markets  with  current  and  new  competitors  who  may  be  able  to  adapt  more  quickly  to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against  current  or  new  competitors  who  may  have  stronger  positions  in  these  new  markets  or  superior  ability  to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore, we may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry.",

          "chunk_text": "- our IP rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\n- rights previously granted by third parties to IP licensed or assigned to us, including portfolio cross-licenses, will not hamper our ability to assert our IP rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes;\n- any of our pending or future patent, trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n- our IP rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal protection may be weak; or\n- we have sufficient IP rights to protect our products or our business.\n\nEffective IP protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions, relative to those protections available in the U.S., and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions. In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us.\n\nWe also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our IP. Licensing of our IP rights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights. In addition, we may acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties. These licensing obligations may extend to our own IP following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our IP rights. From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights, including, in some cases, against our customers and suppliers. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. Conversely, third parties have and may in the future pursue IP litigation against us, including as a result of our IP licensing business. An adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our IP rights and limit the value of our technology, including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments, which could otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFrom time to time, we may need to obtain additional IP licenses or renew existing license agreements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all.\n\nIf our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and services could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nWe may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems, systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities. We must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments.\n\nFurther, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties. If we lose access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software. In addition, if software providers and hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest vendors, adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access, this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products. Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.\n\n## Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nMany of our existing customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts. Customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors, any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, if at all. The failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.\n\nCertain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future, which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense.\n\nSome of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties, some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive.

      "answer": "ACN has been increasing its allocation to non-U.S. equity securities, rising from 19% in 2023 to 28% targeted for 2025, indicating a strategy that embraces greater international diversification and potentially higher risk in its pension fund management. In contrast, TXN maintains a fixed 35% allocation to equity securities exclusively in U.S. defined benefit plans, with no allocation to equities in U.S. retiree health care or non-U.S. defined benefit plans, reflecting a more conservative and domestically focused approach. This contrast highlights differing risk appetites: ACN appears to be pursuing a more aggressive growth strategy, while TXN emphasizes stability and lower volatility.",

        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, TXN maintains a consistent 35% equity allocation only in U.S. defined benefit plans, with no equity exposure in other categories, indicating a more risk-averse posture.",

      "answer": "Delivery failures present different financial risks to ACN and TXN based on their business models. For ACN, delivery failures could damage its brand reputation, which is crucial for differentiating services from competitors like advertising agencies and technology startups. This reputational harm could lead to loss of business and clients, directly impacting its competitive position in the IT services market. For TXN, delivery failures could result in product liability claims or recalls, which may incur significant expenses in settlements, inventory write-offs, or customer compensation. TXN generates about 25% of its revenue through distributors, who might promote competing product lines if delivery issues persist, potentially reducing TXN's sales. While ACN's risks focus on brand and reputation, TXN faces tangible costs and distribution challenges due to delivery failures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from ACN evidence - ACN's competitive landscape includes advertising agencies, engineering services providers, and technology startups that may offer more attractive alternatives, and delivery failures could damage its brand reputation, affecting client relationships and competitive position.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies face risks from delivery failures, ACN's risks are tied to brand reputation and competitive position in the IT services market, whereas TXN's risks are connected to product liability costs and distributor relationships in its semiconductor business."

      "answer": "ACN plans to pay approximately $158,422 in fiscal 2025 for defined benefit pension plans and unfunded frozen plan payments, indicating a more substantial obligation that may reflect a larger pension liability footprint. In contrast, TXN expects to contribute about $10 million to its retirement benefit plans in 2024, suggesting a smaller-scale commitment relative to ACN. Both companies state compliance with minimum funding requirements, but ACN's significantly higher contribution highlights a potentially more aggressive approach to addressing pension obligations, possibly due to differences in plan size, structure, or funding history. These figures demonstrate how each company meets its regulatory obligations through contributions tailored to its specific pension liabilities.",

Texas Instruments, on the other hand, has financial risk exposure through its purchase commitments for software licenses, which are binding with fixed or minimum payment schedules. This means TI must account for these obligations in its financial planning, potentially limiting flexibility in capital allocation.",

      "answer": "Both AAPL and QCOM highlight vulnerabilities related to their reliance on global suppliers, but each emphasizes different aspects of the risk. AAPL notes that its supply chain is exposed to information technology system failures and cybersecurity incidents, such as ransomware or other malicious attacks, which could disrupt business operations and affect manufacturing and shipping of its products. QCOM, on the other hand, emphasizes its dependence on sole- or limited-source suppliers and the risks associated with manufacturing capacity constraints, including the potential inability to meet customer demand due to limited access to leading process technologies. Both companies acknowledge that supplier disruptions could negatively impact their business, results of operations, and cash flows, but the nature of their vulnerabilities differs based on their operational focus\u2014AAPL on cybersecurity and IT continuity, and QCOM on supply capacity and process technology transitions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (AAPL) - AAPL highlights that its global supply chain is exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations and interfere with the manufacturing and shipping of its products.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (QCOM) - QCOM emphasizes reliance on sole- or limited-source suppliers and the risks associated with manufacturing capacity constraints, especially during transitions to smaller geometry process technologies, which could limit its ability to meet customer demand.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on global suppliers, but the specific vulnerabilities differ: AAPL focuses on IT and cybersecurity risks, while QCOM focuses on supply capacity and process technology risks. Both acknowledge the potential negative impact on operations and financial performance."

      "answer": "AAPL discloses exposure to inventory write-downs and product replacement costs due to design and manufacturing defects, with potential impacts including lost sales, warranty expenses, and inventory obsolescence. These risks are tied to its reliance on custom components with limited suppliers, and the possibility of defects in both internally developed and third-party components. INTC, on the other hand, highlights financial risks from product defects and security vulnerabilities that may require inventory write-downs, legal liability, and product replacements. Both companies rely on third-party components, but INTC also faces additional exposure from delays or ineffectiveness of mitigation techniques developed by third parties, which could prolong the financial impact of vulnerabilities. While neither company quantifies exact figures for potential losses, the exposure mechanisms differ: AAPL's risks are more tied to hardware/software integration and supply chain constraints, whereas INTC's are more focused on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and their broader reputational and legal implications.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AAPL's filing that product defects can lead to inventory write-downs, product replacements, warranty expenses, and lost sales, with reliance on custom components from limited suppliers increasing exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained,  or  when  an  outsourcing  partner  has  delayed  shipments  of  completed  products  to  the  Company,  the  Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected  depending  on  the  time  required  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  from  the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\n## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe  Company  offers  complex  hardware  and  software  products  and  services  that  can  be  affected  by  design  and  manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company's services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues  and  defects  in  the  hardware,  software  and  services  it  offers.  Failure  to  do  so  can  result  in  widespread  technical  and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and/or  intangible assets,  and  significant  warranty  and  other  expenses,  including  litigation  costs  and  regulatory  fines.  Quality  problems  can  also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market  acceptance,  reduced  demand  for  products  and  services,  delay  in  new  product  and service introductions and lost sales.\n\n## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe  Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Although  the  Company  believes  its  inventory,  capital  assets,  inventory  prepayments  and  other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments. Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  cover  the  Company's  forecasted  component  and  manufacturing  requirements,  typically  for periods  up  to  150  days.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are  volatile,  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid  technology  and  price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\n## The  Company  relies  on  access  to  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  may  not  be  available  to  the  Company  on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in  the  future  may  compete,  current  extensive  patent  coverage  and  the  rapid  rate  of  issuance  of  new  patents,  the  Company's products  and  services  can  unknowingly  infringe  existing  patents  or  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  From  time  to  time,  the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

Mitigation techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis-or at all-and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. Product issues can damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.\n\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown.\" Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.\n\nMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis-or at all-and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, failure to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes.\n\nOther Key Information\n\n55",

      "question": "How does Intel's 2022 competitive risk analysis regarding TSMC's manufacturing process improvements reflect the competitive dynamics that followed Apple's 2020 transition to ARM-based semiconductor designs in its PC products?",
      "answer": "Intel's 2022 10-K filing highlights that manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed to increasingly competitive offerings from Intel's rivals, particularly those relying on third-party foundries. This reflects a broader challenge for Intel, as competitors leveraging TSMC's advanced processes can deliver more competitive products, especially in areas like performance-per-watt efficiency. Apple's 2020 transition to its own ARM-based designs\u2014manufactured by TSMC\u2014aligns with this dynamic, as Apple's internally developed chips have benefited from TSMC's process technology. As a result, Apple's products have become stronger competitors to Intel's client CPUs, contributing to a weakened competitive position for Intel in the PC processor market. This interplay shows how Intel's IDM (integrated device manufacturer) model and reliance on internal process development place it at a disadvantage compared to competitors using TSMC, including Apple, which has seen success with its ARM-based PC lineup.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (AAPL 2022 10-K) - Apple transitioned to internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in its PC products in 2020.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (INTC 2022 10-K) - Intel acknowledges that TSMC's manufacturing process improvements have enhanced the competitiveness of its rivals, particularly those using third-party foundries.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Apple\u2019s use of TSMC to manufacture its ARM-based chips gives it access to the same cutting-edge process technology that Intel cites as a competitive threat. This directly ties Intel\u2019s stated risk about TSMC-enabled competitors to Apple\u2019s strategic product shift in 2020, showing how Intel\u2019s position has been affected by companies like Apple that now compete more effectively using TSMC."

          "chunk_text": "Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs. Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. As we make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened. Conversely, at times demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n\nOur IDM 2.0 investments in capacity and our process technology roadmap will require capital expenditures above our historical levels, and if demand for our IFS business grows rapidly, we anticipate that we would need to accelerate our planned investments to meet that demand. To the extent we do not generate expected cash flows, we may be required to increase our use of external funding sources to fund our investments and operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. There is legislation under consideration in the US and EU to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but there can be no assurance that such funding will be enacted, and there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to any restrictions on recipients. To the extent such funding is below our expectations, our anticipated cash requirements would increase. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects.\n\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.\n\nOur products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business, for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.\n\nWe face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.\n\nMost of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. While we have set out a process technology roadmap to attain future process performance-per-watt parity and leadership relative to TSMC, our plans are subject to a number of risks and we could fail to realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and the risks described in the section \"We are vulnerable to product and manufacturingrelated risks.\" As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&amp;D spending than many of our \"fabless\" competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.",

      "question": "How do manufacturing process improvements by TSMC, as stated in Intel's 2022 10-K, potentially impact the competitive dynamics between Apple and Intel in the PC processor market, particularly in light of Apple's transition to internally developed ARM-based chips?",
      "answer": "According to Intel's 2022 10-K, manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed to increasingly competitive offerings by Intel's rivals, including Apple, which has introduced PC products using its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs. Intel acknowledges that Apple's products and ecosystem now represent growing competitive pressure in the PC processor market. Meanwhile, Apple's 2022 10-K highlights its dependence on outsourcing partners, such as TSMC, for component manufacturing, and notes the risks associated with supply chain disruptions and its ability to manage new product transitions. TSMC's advanced manufacturing capabilities enable Apple to produce high-performance, custom-designed chips that support its vertical integration strategy, enhancing its competitive position against Intel. Therefore, TSMC's process improvements directly support Apple\u2019s ability to innovate and compete in the PC market, intensifying the competitive pressure Intel faces.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b (Intel's 10-K), extract that TSMC's manufacturing process improvements have contributed to increasingly competitive offerings by rivals, specifically noting Apple\u2019s use of internally developed ARM-based chips.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract that Apple's transition to ARM-based PC products is cited as a growing competitive threat to Intel.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_a (Apple's 10-K), extract that Apple relies on outsourcing partners, such as TSMC, for component manufacturing and that disruptions in these partnerships could affect its ability to manage product transitions.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: TSMC\u2019s manufacturing capabilities enable Apple to develop and scale its custom ARM-based chips, which strengthens Apple\u2019s competitive position in the PC processor market and increases pressure on Intel."

          "chunk_text": "## Business Risks\n\n## To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually  introduce  new  products,  services  and  technologies,  enhance  existing  products  and  services,  effectively  stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the  availability  of  application  software  for  the  Company's  products,  the  effective  management  of  purchase  commitments  and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\n## The  Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company's supply  chain  require  considerable  time  and  resources  and  involve  significant  risks  and  uncertainties.  The  Company  has  also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  quality  or  quantity  of  products  manufactured  or  services  provided,  or  adversely  affect  the Company's  flexibility  to  respond  to  changing  conditions.  Although  arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for product  defect  expense  reimbursement,  the  Company  generally  remains  responsible  to  the  consumer  for  warranty  and  out-ofwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe  Company  relies  on  single-source  outsourcing  partners  in  the  U.S.,  Asia  and  Europe  to  supply  and  manufacture  many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure  the  supply  of  components  and  finished  goods,  if  these  outsourcing  partners  or  suppliers  experience  severe  financial problems  or  other  disruptions  in  their  business,  such  continued  supply  can  be  reduced  or  terminated,  and  the  recoverability  of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\n## Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation  within  a  particular  industry,  further  limiting  the  Company's  ability  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  of  components  on commercially  reasonable  terms  or  at  all.  The  effects  of  global  or  regional  economic  conditions  on  the  Company's  suppliers, described in ' The  Company's  operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on  global  and  regional  economic  conditions  and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, ' above, can also affect the Company's ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.",

          "chunk_text": "Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs. Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. As we make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened. Conversely, at times demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n\nOur IDM 2.0 investments in capacity and our process technology roadmap will require capital expenditures above our historical levels, and if demand for our IFS business grows rapidly, we anticipate that we would need to accelerate our planned investments to meet that demand. To the extent we do not generate expected cash flows, we may be required to increase our use of external funding sources to fund our investments and operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. There is legislation under consideration in the US and EU to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but there can be no assurance that such funding will be enacted, and there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to any restrictions on recipients. To the extent such funding is below our expectations, our anticipated cash requirements would increase. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects.\n\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.\n\nOur products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business, for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.\n\nWe face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.\n\nMost of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd.

Additionally, its use of open-source software may expose it to liability due to security vulnerabilities or compliance issues. Qualcomm (QCOM), on the other hand, faces challenges in enforcing its intellectual property rights, including resistance from OEMs in paying fair royalties, potential adverse legal decisions, and limitations in foreign jurisdictions that may weaken its licensing programs.

      "answer": "Oracle's strategic priority centers on software licensing and cloud services, where application software plays a key role in generating cloud and license revenues. These revenues are tied to perpetual licenses and subscription-based cloud offerings, with 90% of customers typically renewing their license support contracts annually. In contrast, Texas Instruments emphasizes semiconductor manufacturing, investing heavily in 300-millimeter wafer fabrication technology, which reduces costs by approximately 40% compared to 200-millimeter wafers. This highlights a fundamental difference in strategic focus: Oracle prioritizes software-driven, recurring revenue models, while Texas Instruments leverages capital-intensive manufacturing to maintain a structural cost advantage in analog and embedded processing products.",

These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment  of  a  particular  transaction  is  specifically  dictated  by  GAAP  and  does  not  require  management's  judgment  in  its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur sources of revenues include:\n\n- cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud licenses and onpremise licenses, which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;\n- hardware  revenues,  which  include  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and\n- services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting and advanced customer services.\n\nLicense  support  revenues  are  typically  generated  through  the  sale  of  license  support  contracts  related  to  cloud  license  and  onpremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\n\nCloud  services  revenues  include  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  deliver  applications  and  infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.\n\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, onpremise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer's option.\n\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer  servers,  storage,  and  industry-specific  hardware.  Our  hardware  support  offerings  generally  provide  customers  with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.\n\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services.",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company's product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers' prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products.\n\n## Market cycle\n\nThe 'semiconductor cycle' refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters.\n\n## Customers, sales and distribution\n\nWe sell our products to over 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than 40% of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100.\n\nWe market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and applications team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. For example, in 2021 about two-thirds of our revenue was direct, and transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of our revenue, as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n\nOur investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. We expanded the reach of our TI.com e-commerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. In addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments.\n\nWe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.\n\nWe invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage provides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced 300-millimeter capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300-millimeter wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200-millimeter wafer.",

If enacted, these proposals would materially increase the level of income tax on our international profits.\n\nOur future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase if any of the foregoing potential tax changes are implemented or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  fluctuations  in  our  stock  price  and  level  of  stock-based  compensation  expense, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.\n\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges.  Any  such  violations  could  result  in  prohibitions  on  our  ability  to  offer  our  products  and  services  in  one  or  more countries,  could  delay  or  prevent  potential  acquisitions  and  could  also  materially  damage  our  reputation,  our  brand,  our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. These laws can require  suspension  or  termination  of  business,  including  financial  transactions,  in  certain  countries,  territories  or  with  certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example,  in  response  to  the  current  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  have  announced  extensive  sanctions against Russia and could impose broader sanctions or take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Oracle recorded fiscal 2022 revenues of $248 million from these two countries, a reduction of $118 million relative to fiscal 2021. No revenues are expected to be recognized from these two countries prospectively. Compliance with these laws also requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management's attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate  allegations  of  improprieties  relating  to  transactions  and  the  way  in  which  such  transactions  are  recorded.  Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information. No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.\n\nWe are  also  subject  to  a  variety  of  other  risks  and  challenges  in  managing  an  organization  operating  globally,  including  those related to:\n\n- general economic conditions in each country or region;\n- political  unrest,  terrorism,  war  and  the  potential  for  other  hostilities,  including  but  not  limited  to,  the  current  RussiaUkraine  conflict,  the  economic  impact  thereof  and  the  potential  to  subject  our  business  to  materially  adverse consequences  should  the  situation  escalate  beyond  its  current  scope,  including,  among  other  potential  impacts,  the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the rest of Europe, where a material portion of our business is carried out;\n- public  health  risks,  social  risks  and  supporting  infrastructure  stability  risks,  particularly  in  areas  in  which  we  have significant operations;",

In the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\n\n## Our results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance.\n\nIn 2021, about one-third of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our products. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business.\n\n## Our margins vary.\n\nOur profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; freight costs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result.\n\n## Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment.\n\nOur continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws and policies, including changes to, or the administration or interpretation of, those laws and policies.\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks\n\n## Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.\n\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment and climate change; safety; health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; epidemics; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. If we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.",

This approach introduces uncertainty in workforce management and may increase costs related to real estate, cybersecurity, and employee retention. In contrast, Texas Instruments proactively assesses and addresses health, safety, and environmental risks in its manufacturing operations by implementing pollution prevention practices, such as recycling and emissions control. These efforts support their long-term capacity planning, including investments in 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in Texas and Utah, which are expected to lower manufacturing costs and provide greater control over their supply chain.

These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings, and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees. We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other members of our executive team; and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We recently reopened certain of our offices around the globe and we intend to reopen other offices when it is safe to do so and local requirements allow. Our employees continue to have flexibility to choose where and how to work. Depending on their role, this means that many employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all of the time. While we believe this may help us engage with a wider pool of talent and may help to retain employees who want or need more flexibility, it  may  fail  to  yield  these  desired  benefits  and  could  also  lead  to  increased  employee  burnout  or  negatively  impact  employee productivity, and it may present cybersecurity risks and additional risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy. Despite our efforts to reopen our offices in a safe manner, our employees who have opted to return to the office may nevertheless be exposed to health risks, which may expose us to potential liability.\n\nWe may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.\n\nWe continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise  are  available  at  lower  costs.  When  we  make  adjustments  to  our  workforce,  we  may  incur  expenses  associated  with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We are experiencing increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which has affected our employee retention efforts and increased our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.\n\nOur  general  compensation  program  includes  restricted  stock  units  and  performance-based  equity,  which  are  important  tools  in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\n\nOur cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results. Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if:\n\n- our contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate;\n- any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant;\n- the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken; or",

Progress and investments include:\n\n- continuing construction of RFAB2 (Richardson, Texas), our next 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, to begin production in the second half of 2022;\n- purchasing a 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Lehi, Utah, to support analog and embedded processing manufacturing, which is expected to begin production in early 2023; and\n- planning construction on our next two 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in Sherman, Texas, to begin in 2022. This North Texas site has the potential for up to four fabrication facilities to meet demand over time, as semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Production is expected to begin in 2025.\n\nTogether, these investments are designed to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, provide us with lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, and support growth over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nWe assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our manufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials, controlling harmful emissions, and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances.\n\nWe expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2021, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors.\n\n## Inventory\n\nOur objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nWe purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license.",

Our products and services include  enterprise  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  that  are  delivered  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and interoperable  IT  deployment  models.  These  models  include  on-premise  deployments,  cloud-based  deployments,  and  hybrid deployments  (an  approach  that  combines  both  on-premise  and  cloud-based  deployments).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  the  information  contained  within  Item  1  Business  and  Note  14  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\n\n## Cloud and License Business\n\nOur  cloud  and  license  business,  which  represented  85%  and  84%  of  our  total  revenues  in  fiscal  2022  and  2021,  respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n\n- Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:\n- o license  support  revenues,  which  are  earned  by  providing  Oracle  license  support  services  to  customers  that  have elected  to  purchase  support  services  in  connection  with  the  purchase  of  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure software  licenses  for  use  in  cloud,  on-premise  and  other  IT  environments.  Substantially  all  license  support customers  renew  their  support  contracts  with  us  upon  expiration  in  order  to  continue  to  benefit  from  technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and\n- o cloud  services  revenues,  which  provide  customers  access  to  Oracle  Cloud  applications  and  infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment  models  that Oracle develops, provides unspecified  updates  and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that",

Our marketable equity securities investments in publicly traded companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. Our non-marketable equity securities investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment. Our non-marketable equity securities investments accounted for under the equity method, primarily in a related party entity, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these equity method investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover. The timing and amounts of changes in fair value, if any, of our marketable and non-marketable equity investments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance  of  the  companies  in  which  we  invest.

          "chunk_text": "- Other long-term assets - Long-term investments, which are included within other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable equity securities.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory.\n\nWe review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer shipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles; and other capitalized costs\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization.\n\n## Impairments of long-lived assets\n\nWe regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. See Note 11 for additional information.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nThe functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred taxes, other longterm assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are calculated at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&amp;E.\n\n## Derivatives and hedging\n\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&amp;E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments.\n\nWe are exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. We use total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense, recognizing changes in the value of the swaps and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&amp;A.",

      "answer": "Both IBM and Texas Instruments (TXN) identify delivery failures as significant risk factors, but the financial implications differ based on their business models. IBM highlights that delivery failures could damage its brand image, which in turn could impair its ability to attract and retain customers, talent, and ecosystem partners \u2014 a reputational risk that indirectly affects revenue generation and client retention. TXN, on the other hand, explicitly states that delivery failures could lead to warranty claims, product recalls, and inventory write-offs, which directly impact its financial results. For TXN, these events could result in significant expenses, including legal costs, settlements, and compensation to customers, as well as a potential loss from writing off inventory values.",

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated",

In the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\n\n## Our results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance.\n\nIn 2021, about one-third of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our products. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business.\n\n## Our margins vary.\n\nOur profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; freight costs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result.\n\n## Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment.\n\nOur continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws and policies, including changes to, or the administration or interpretation of, those laws and policies.\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks\n\n## Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.\n\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment and climate change; safety; health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; epidemics; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. If we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.",

The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Item 2. Properties:\n\nIBM's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31, 2021, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 52 million square feet worldwide.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, IBM's facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 11 million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled nearly 32 million square feet, of which 7 million was owned and 25 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company's cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments.\n\nContinuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations.\n\n## Item 3.

During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized expense of $25,369, $35,285 and $21,140 in interest and penalties, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $177,610 ($159,814, net of tax benefits) and $166,846 ($151,184, net of tax benefits) were reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nAs a global company, we file tax returns in multiple tax jurisdictions including the U.S. and Ireland. We have participated in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') Compliance Assurance Process ('CAP') program since fiscal 2016. CAP tax years are examined by the IRS on a contemporaneous basis so that most issues are resolved prior to filing the tax return. The years from fiscal 2021 forward remain open for examination by the IRS. The years from fiscal 2018 forward remain open for examination by the Irish tax authorities. We are currently under audit in numerous state and other non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. However, with limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to examination by those taxing authorities for years before 2014. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, we do not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We believe that it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits recorded at September 25, 2022 may result in a cash payment in fiscal 2023. Unrecognized tax benefits at September 25, 2022 included $135 million for tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits differ from the amount that would affect our effective tax rate primarily because the unrecognized tax benefits were included on a gross basis and did not reflect related receivables or secondary impacts, such as the federal deduction for state taxes, adjustments to deferred tax assets and the valuation allowance that might be required if our tax positions are sustained. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits for all periods presented was primarily due to expected refunds of Korean withholding tax previously paid (which such increase had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision). If successful, the refund will result in a corresponding reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits. We believe that it is likely that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 25, 2022 will increase in fiscal 2023 as licensees in Korea continue to withhold taxes on future payments due under their licensing agreements at a rate higher than we believe is owed; such increase is not expected to have a significant impact on our income tax provision. At September 25, 2022, total interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued in other current liabilities and other liabilities was $168 million, with a corresponding noncurrent income taxes receivable of $108 million recorded in other assets for expected refunds of certain tax benefits.\n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. For tax years prior to fiscal 2021, we are a participant in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) Program, whereby we and the IRS endeavor to agree on the treatment of all tax issues prior to the tax return being filed. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2018. We are also subject to examination in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds, many of which are open for periods after fiscal 2001. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. At September 25, 2022, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known. However, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provision and the related accruals.\n\nCash amounts paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $2.1 billion, $1.5 billion and $0.8 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Note 4.

In contrast, ADBE maintained its allowance for doubtful accounts by considering both specific and general reserves, with a focus on factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of trade receivable balances, and economic conditions. As of December 3, 2021, ADBE's trade receivables net of allowances were $1.88 billion. The difference in methodologies\u2014ACN's forward-looking approach versus ADBE's combined specific and general reserve strategy\u2014reflects how each company tailors its credit risk evaluation, directly influencing the scale and specificity of their recorded allowances.",

We elected the practical expedient to report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.\n\n## Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements\n\nShare-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs from previous estimates.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We establish liabilities or reduce assets when we believe tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Each fiscal quarter, we evaluate tax positions and adjust the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items.\n\n## Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including certificates of deposit and time deposits. As a result of certain subsidiaries' cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances. Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses-Client Receivables and Contract Assets\n\nWe record client receivables and contract assets at their face amounts less an allowance for credit losses. The allowance represents our estimate of expected credit losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the total allowances recorded for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $25,786 and $32,206, respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nOur financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments and client receivables, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.",

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. Included in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced, and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing.

      "question": "What specific cybersecurity-related financial risks do Accenture (ACN) and Qualcomm (QCOM) disclose in their 2023 10-K filings, and how do these risks reflect distinct vulnerabilities based on their respective business models in the information technology sector?",
      "answer": "Accenture (ACN) discloses that cybersecurity incidents, including malware attacks, could lead to significant financial exposure, legal liability, and reputational damage. Specifically, ACN mentions that failure to comply with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. This highlights a direct financial risk tied to data protection failures. Qualcomm (QCOM), on the other hand, emphasizes the risk of cyberattacks targeting its IT systems, particularly those that could expose proprietary technology or disrupt manufacturing operations. QCOM notes that successful breaches could lead to misappropriation of intellectual property and widespread business disruption, which would directly impact its competitive position in the semiconductor industry. These distinct risks reflect ACN's vulnerability as a services provider handling sensitive client data and QCOM's exposure as a semiconductor manufacturer reliant on protecting proprietary technology.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From ACN's filing, extract the financial penalty of up to 4% of worldwide revenue for GDPR noncompliance as a specific cybersecurity-related financial risk.",
        "Step 2: From QCOM's filing, extract the potential consequences of cyberattacks, including misappropriation of intellectual property and disruption to manufacturing operations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two distinct business models \u2014 ACN as a data-intensive services provider versus QCOM as a semiconductor manufacturer \u2014 to explain how their cybersecurity risks manifest differently and impact their financial and operational resilience."

      "question": "How might changes in ESG-related regulatory requirements differently impact ACN's global compliance costs and QCOM's manufacturing operations, and what financial implications could these changes have for each company?",
      "answer": "ACN faces increased compliance burdens and costs due to evolving ESG regulations, particularly related to climate, human rights, and supply chain disclosures. These requirements could hinder its ability to meet ESG commitments such as its 2040 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target and 2025 gender parity goal. Additionally, ACN's global operations expose it to conflicting legal requirements, making compliance costly and resource-intensive. On the other hand, QCOM notes that ESG-related regulatory changes could require it to revise current practices, policies, or procedures, incurring higher costs and diverting management attention. QCOM's manufacturing facilities are also exposed to environmental compliance costs and climate change impacts. Both companies face financial risks from ESG regulation, but ACN's exposure centers on global compliance costs and supply chain challenges, while QCOM's risks are tied to operational adjustments in manufacturing and evolving interpretations of ESG rules.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from ACN's 10-K - ACN notes that new ESG regulations could increase compliance costs and hinder its ability to meet ESG commitments such as its 2040 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target and 2025 gender parity goal.",
        "Step 2: Extract from QCOM's 10-K - QCOM highlights that evolving ESG-related regulations may require costly revisions to practices and policies, and could divert management attention toward compliance activities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies face financial risks from ESG regulation, ACN's exposure is tied to global compliance and supply chain complexities, whereas QCOM's exposure stems from operational adjustments in manufacturing and regulatory uncertainty."

      "question": "What specific role do system integrators play in AMD's channel distribution strategy, and how does this compare to Salesforce's (CRM) strategic use of system integrators in delivering technology solutions to customers?",
      "answer": "AMD utilizes system integrators as part of its channel distribution strategy to deliver its products to end-users, particularly in the Data Center Segment, where system integrators are listed as one of the key customer categories alongside hyperscale data centers, OEMs, and ODMs. AMD also supports these integrators through co-marketing development programs and market development funds to promote products integrated into third-party systems. In contrast, Salesforce (CRM) leverages system integrators (SIs) as consulting partners who deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, ranging from large-scale implementations to limited-scope solutions that improve business efficiency. CRM emphasizes strategic investments in SIs as part of its broader partner ecosystem to accelerate reach into new markets and industries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AMD\u2019s 10-K filing, system integrators are explicitly listed as part of its customer base in the Data Center Segment, and AMD provides them with co-marketing and market development funds to support the integration of AMD products into third-party systems.",
        "Step 2: From Salesforce\u2019s (CRM) 10-K filing, system integrators are described as consulting partners who deliver both large-scale and limited technology solutions to customers, and CRM strategically invests in these SIs to expand its ecosystem and accelerate market reach.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the role of system integrators in both companies \u2014 while both companies engage with system integrators, AMD does so primarily as a distribution channel and integration partner for hardware, whereas Salesforce utilizes them as implementation and consulting partners within a software ecosystem."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- an enterprise application marketplace and a community of tens of millions of Trailblazers: passionate developers, admins and experts who use Salesforce to innovate and extend the platform with thousands of partner applications.\n\n## Our Business and Growth Strategy\n\nWe continue to expand in the growing addressable markets across all of our service offerings. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. We orient our business strategy and invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities:\n\nExpand relationships with existing customers. We see significant opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships through cross-selling and upselling our service offerings. For example, we continue to focus on driving multiple service offering adoption, which provides our customers with a one-stop-shop for their front-office business technology needs. As our customers realize the benefits of our entire suite of service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customers' ex perience with new products and features and gain additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units. Finally, we aim to ex pand our relationships with ex isting customers through our additional support offerings.\n\nIncrease geographic reach. By extending our go-to-market capabilities globally, we aim to grow our business by selling to new customers in new regions. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in most major markets globally. We also plan to continue to develop distribution channels through new and existing marketplaces and partners for our solutions around the globe and new goto-market strategies. We continue to invest in our domestic and international operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world.\n\nFocus on industries and new products. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative and value-driven solutions in new categories based on our existing and potential customers' needs. For example, we provide out-of-the-box solutions specifically built for customers in certain industries, such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing and more. In addition, through direct discussions and strategic engagements with our customers, we are able to deliver the innovations and enhancements that align with the needs of our customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform for deploying autonomous AI agents across any business function. Agentforce includes a set of tools to create and customize AI agents, as well as a library of ready-to-use skills for any use case across sales, service, marketing and commerce, Tableau, Slack, partners and more.\n\nLeverage our partner ecosystem. The Salesforce Platform enables customers, independent software vendors ('ISVs') and third-party developers to create, test and deliver cloud-based applications. These applications can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by software vendors. In addition, we rely on our consulting partners to deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, from large-scale implementations to more limited solutions that help businesses run more efficiently. We continue to work with and invest in our partner ecosystem, including these ISVs and system integrators ('SIs'), to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries.\n\nPromote strong customer adoption and reduce customer attrition. We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. Our customer success programs, including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists, help enable and accelerate our customers' digital transformations. In addition, we have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies learn our systems and a community of Trailblazers who drive innovation. With these programs and resources, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions.\n\n## Mergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our Salesforce Platform. Our evaluation seeks to confirm that any potential acquisition accelerates our strategy, represents an attractive customer opportunity, provides a pathway to effectively monetize the acquired products and drive significant operational efficiencies and presents a clear timeline for value accretion. Our acquisitions can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and accelerate development of features to large-scale acquisitions that result in new service offerings. Our goal is to prioritize the use of our balance sheet, through cash and debt, to complete acquisitions.\n\nWe also manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and SIs. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company's initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, including AI. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find attractive, including investments in companies representing targeted businesses, technological initiatives and geographies. Our strategy includes growing our strategic investment portfolio, in part, by reinvesting proceeds from the sales of strategic investments.",

      "question": "How do the privacy risks associated with Salesforce's generative AI development and Intel's cybersecurity vulnerabilities differently impact their respective business models given their positions in the technology sector?",
      "answer": "Salesforce faces privacy risks tied to its development of generative AI products like Einstein GPT, which could produce flawed content that leads to legal liability, reputational harm, or competitive disadvantage. These risks are compounded by the costs of ensuring ethical AI implementation and the regulatory scrutiny surrounding data practices. In contrast, Intel faces increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks that could expose vulnerabilities in its products, directly impacting its semiconductor business model by undermining customer trust and increasing liability. While Salesforce's risks stem from data governance and AI ethics in a SaaS model, Intel's risks are tied to product security in a hardware-centric model, highlighting how privacy risks manifest differently depending on the company's core operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Salesforce's development of Einstein GPT and other generative AI products introduces risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy, and data provenance, which could lead to legal liability, reputational harm, and increased operational costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Intel faces increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks that could expose vulnerabilities in its products, directly impacting its business by undermining customer trust and increasing liability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies face privacy-related risks, Salesforce's challenges are tied to data governance and AI ethics in a SaaS business model, whereas Intel's risks are rooted in product security for hardware, showing how privacy concerns affect different technology sector business models in distinct ways."

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's development of Windows-compatible chipsets influence Microsoft's Windows OEM licensing revenue model and competitive positioning in the PC market?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm develops chipsets that support the Windows operating system (as stated in its 10-K filing), enabling OEMs to pre-install Windows on devices they manufacture. Microsoft's Windows OEM licensing revenue is directly impacted by the number of Windows licenses purchased by OEMs for pre-installation on devices. When Qualcomm provides chipsets that support Windows, it facilitates broader device manufacturing across form factors and price points, which increases the attachment rate of Windows to shipped devices. This, in turn, boosts Microsoft's OEM licensing revenue. Furthermore, Qualcomm's chipset innovations\u2014spanning CPUs, GPUs, and connectivity technologies\u2014allow OEMs to create more competitive Windows-based devices, strengthening Microsoft\u2019s position against alternative platforms like Linux and macOS in the PC market.",

IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PCbased distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.\n\nOur database, business intelligence,  and  data  warehousing  solutions  offerings  compete  with  products  from  IBM,  Oracle,  SAP, Snowflake, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete  against  offerings  from  Adobe,  IBM,  Oracle,  and  other  companies,  and  also  against  open-source  projects,  including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails.\n\nWe believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering  superior  applications,  development  tools,  compatibility  with  a  broad  base  of  hardware  and  software  applications, security, and manageability.\n\nOur  Enterprise  Services  business  competes  with  a  wide  range  of  companies  that  provide  strategy  and  business  planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.\n\n## More Personal Computing\n\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n- Windows,  including  Windows  OEM  licensing  ('Windows  OEM')  and  other  non-volume  licensing  of  the  Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.\n- Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.\n- Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games  and  in-game  content),  Xbox  Game  Pass  and  other  subscriptions,  Xbox  Cloud  Gaming,  third-party  disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.\n- Search and news advertising.\n\n## Windows\n\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:\n\n- The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.\n- Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.\n- Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.\n- Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.\n- Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.\n- Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.\n- Constraints in the supply chain of device components.\n- Piracy.",

      "answer": "Both IBM and Oracle face risks from labor relations laws due to their global operations, which require compliance with diverse regulatory environments. Oracle specifically reported a $118 million reduction in fiscal 2022 revenue due to the withdrawal of its operations from Russia and Belarus in response to sanctions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. IBM highlights that global regulatory risks, including labor relations laws, could impact its operations and financial results, though it does not quantify the impact. Oracle's financial change demonstrates a direct impact of geopolitical and regulatory shifts on revenue, while IBM emphasizes the broader systemic risk without specific financial figures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nincluding sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the company's financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict.\n\nDue to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions, including the COVID-19 Pandemic: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company's ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. For example, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption.\n\nThe Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, artificial intelligence, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.\n\nIneffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nThe Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition, including considering financial implications of the macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, under 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' In addition, as discussed in note S, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.",

If enacted, these proposals would materially increase the level of income tax on our international profits.\n\nOur future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase if any of the foregoing potential tax changes are implemented or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  fluctuations  in  our  stock  price  and  level  of  stock-based  compensation  expense, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.\n\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges.  Any  such  violations  could  result  in  prohibitions  on  our  ability  to  offer  our  products  and  services  in  one  or  more countries,  could  delay  or  prevent  potential  acquisitions  and  could  also  materially  damage  our  reputation,  our  brand,  our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. These laws can require  suspension  or  termination  of  business,  including  financial  transactions,  in  certain  countries,  territories  or  with  certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example,  in  response  to  the  current  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  have  announced  extensive  sanctions against Russia and could impose broader sanctions or take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Oracle recorded fiscal 2022 revenues of $248 million from these two countries, a reduction of $118 million relative to fiscal 2021. No revenues are expected to be recognized from these two countries prospectively. Compliance with these laws also requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management's attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate  allegations  of  improprieties  relating  to  transactions  and  the  way  in  which  such  transactions  are  recorded.  Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information. No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.\n\nWe are  also  subject  to  a  variety  of  other  risks  and  challenges  in  managing  an  organization  operating  globally,  including  those related to:\n\n- general economic conditions in each country or region;\n- political  unrest,  terrorism,  war  and  the  potential  for  other  hostilities,  including  but  not  limited  to,  the  current  RussiaUkraine  conflict,  the  economic  impact  thereof  and  the  potential  to  subject  our  business  to  materially  adverse consequences  should  the  situation  escalate  beyond  its  current  scope,  including,  among  other  potential  impacts,  the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the rest of Europe, where a material portion of our business is carried out;\n- public  health  risks,  social  risks  and  supporting  infrastructure  stability  risks,  particularly  in  areas  in  which  we  have significant operations;",

Oracle, on the other hand, highlights total cost of ownership, performance, and compatibility with both local and public cloud environments as central to its competitive strategy against HPE.

The principal competitors in this segment include Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), BMC, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco), Informatica, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, SAP, Splunk and VMware. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic regions or product segments.\n\n## Consulting:\n\nConsulting has simplified our focus to center on strategy, experience, technology and operations to make our huge range of capabilities easier for clients to navigate. Today, Consulting competes in consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services. We compete with broad-based competitors including: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.\n\n## Infrastructure:\n\nIBM is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions for clients' mission-critical and regulated workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of support services and solutions for hybrid cloud infrastructure. Our principal competitors include Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel and original device manufacturer systems that are often re-branded. Further, as-a-Service providers, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to offer new routes to market for server and storage systems. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission-critical and regulated workloads.\n\n## Financing:\n\nFinancing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating IBM client's acquisition of IT systems, software and services. Financing's ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions.\n\n## Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('Reform Act'). Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forwardlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'expects,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'projects,' and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth under Item 1A. 'Risk Factors' on pages 3 to 10 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, in the company's filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference.",

Of particular note are the efforts made by employees to support colleagues  impacted  by  the  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,  above  and  beyond  the  direct  support  Oracle  has  provided.  In  addition  to monetary donations by employees and by Oracle through its matching program to support humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine and Oracle employees in need, many employees have offered direct assistance to Ukrainian coworkers and their families as they seek safety.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nOur quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the IT industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. See 'Cloud and License Business' in Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of the revenues, expenses and margins of our cloud and license business, which is our largest business.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business.

In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions-including acquisitions,  partnerships  and  joint  ventures,  or repositioning of product lines-which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories.\n\nKey competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of technical  support.  Our  products  and  services  sales  and  the  relative  strength  of  our  products  and  services  versus  those  of  our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors:\n\n- market adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS and cloud infrastructure offerings;\n- the ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings;\n- compatibility  between  Oracle  products  and  services  deployed  within  local  IT  environments  and  public  cloud  IT environments, including our Oracle Cloud environments;\n- the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors;\n- the broader 'platform' competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;",

Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\n## Recent Global Events\n\nOracle  withdrew  its  operations  from  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  Republic  of  Belarus  in  March  2022.  Neither  of  the aforementioned countries, nor Ukraine, have composed or are expected to compose a material portion of Oracle's total consolidated revenues, net income, net assets, or workforce. We serve hundreds of thousands of customers globally across a broad geographic and industry base. We are profitable and generate a large amount of positive cash flow from our operations, and we do not believe the current posture of the Russia-Ukraine situation will jeopardize either of these characteristics of our business. Other impacts due to  this  rapidly  evolving  situation  are  currently  unknown  and  could  potentially  subject  our  business  to  materially  adverse consequences. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, for a discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to the risks included in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the information presented below in Results of Operations in this Item 7.\n\n## Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information\n\nIn our fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis.  We  also  present  a  GAAP-based  discussion  below  for  substantially  all  of  the  other  expense  items  as  presented  in  our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.\n\nIn addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 results of each of our three businesses-cloud and license, hardware  and  services-which  are  our  operating  segments  as  defined  pursuant  to ASC  280, Segment  Reporting .  The  financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.\n\nConsistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation for fiscal 2021 is noted to include any revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2021 due to certain business combination accounting requirements that were eliminated in fiscal 2022. Refer to 'Supplemental Disclosure  Related  to  Certain  Charges'  below  for  additional  discussion  of  these  items  and  Note  14  of  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  for  a  reconciliation  of  the  summations  of  our  total  operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2021.\n\nIn  addition,  research  and  development  expenses,  general  and  administrative  expenses,  stock-based  compensation  expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest  expense,  non-operating expenses or income, net and (provision for) benefit from income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so.

      "question": "How has Splunk's contribution affected Cisco's financial performance, and what does this imply about the competitive dynamics between Cisco and IBM in the enterprise software and observability market?",
      "answer": "Cisco reported that Splunk contributed to growth in its Security and Observability product revenue during fiscal 2024, helping to offset declines in Networking. Splunk's contribution also led to an increase in total gross margin by improving product mix. However, operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 8.8 percentage points due to higher operating expenses and amortization costs from Splunk. On the competitive front, IBM explicitly lists Splunk as a competitor in its Software segment, particularly in hybrid cloud and AI platforms. This implies that Cisco's integration of Splunk strengthens its position in enterprise observability and security, directly influencing the competitive landscape with IBM, which views Splunk as a key rival in similar domains.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Cisco's 10-K, Splunk contributed to growth in Security and Observability revenue and improved gross margin through favorable product mix.",
        "Step 2: Cisco also experienced a decrease in operating income margin due to increased expenses tied to Splunk integration.",
        "Step 3: IBM's 10-K lists Splunk as a direct competitor in the Software segment, particularly in hybrid cloud and AI platforms.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: Splunk enhances Cisco's competitive positioning in areas where IBM also competes, indicating a strategic overlap and intensified rivalry in enterprise IT and observability solutions."

Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 15% and services revenue increased by 6%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in Americas decreased by 11%, EMEA decreased by 11% and APJC decreased by 6%. From a product category perspective, we experienced a product revenue decline in Networking, partially offset by growth in Security and Observability, driven in large part by the contribution of Splunk. Product revenue in Collaboration was flat. Total gross margin increased by 0.3 percentage points, driven by favorable product mix and the contribution from Splunk, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. As  a  percentage  of  revenue,  research  and  development,  sales  and  marketing,  and  general  and  administrative  ex penses,  collectively,  increased  by  8.1 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 8.8 percentage points primarily driven by incremental operating expenses from Splunk and higher amortization of purchased intangible assets. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 44%, driven by a decrease in net income of 45%, partially offset by a decrease in diluted share count of 58 million shares.\n\n## Strategy and Priorities\n\nAcross the globe, businesses and organizations of every size are leveraging Cisco technology to transform and drive better outcomes and experiences. We also help customers navigate emerging technological shifts. Our strategy is to securely connect everything to make those desired outcomes and experiences possible for our customers.\n\nFor a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see 'Item 1.

A summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:\n\n## Software:\n\nThe depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors. Our hybrid cloud and AI platforms allow clients to realize their digital and AI transformations across the applications, data, and environments in which they operate. The principal competitors in this segment include: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, BMC, Broadcom, Informatica, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and Splunk. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic regions or product segments.\n\n## Consulting:\n\nConsulting focuses on integrating skills on strategy, experience, technology and operations by domain and industry. Consulting competes in a dynamic market including consulting, systems integration, application development, application management and business process outsourcing services. Our broad-based competitors include: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, engineering service providers, and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.\n\n## Infrastructure:\n\nIBM is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission-critical and AI workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of life-cycle services for hybrid cloud infrastructure deployment. Our principal competitors include: Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel, NetApp and Pure Storage as well as original device manufacturers (ODMs) who provide systems that are rebranded. Further, cloud service providers are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to offer additional routes to market for server and storage systems.\n\n## Financing:\n\nFinancing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating IBM clients' acquisition of hardware, software and services. Financing's ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include: interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flex ibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily competes with noncaptive financing entities and financial institutions.\n\n## Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('Reform Act'). Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'), in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'ex pects,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'projects,' and similar ex pressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth under Item 1A. 'Risk Factors' on pages 3 to 9 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10K, in the company's filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference.",

The key competitive factors include: interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flex ibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily competes with noncaptive financing entities and financial institutions.\n\n## Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('Reform Act'). Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'), in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'ex pects,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'projects,' and similar ex pressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth under Item 1A. 'Risk Factors' on pages 3 to 9 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10K, in the company's filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference.",

Meanwhile, IBM directly competes with Splunk in the software segment, where Splunk is listed among key competitors such as Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce.

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usagebased royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $23.6 billion. We expect approximately 28% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less.

('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion.",

We compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise, FBAR technology, amplifier design, module integration, proprietary materials processes, multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design, our broad product portfolio, support of key industry standards, reputation for quality products, and our customer relationships.\n\nIn the infrastructure software market, we compete with large enterprise software vendors who continue to expand their product and service offerings and consolidate offerings into broad product lines, and smaller, niche players focused on specific markets. Our primary competitors are Atlassian Corporation, Plc, BMC Software Inc., BeyondTrust Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk Software, Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation, Micro Focus International plc, Microsoft Corporation, New Relic, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Proofpoint, Inc., Rocket Software, Inc., SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc., ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds Corporation, Splunk, Inc. and Zscaler, Inc. We compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools, breadth and synergy of offerings, our platform and hardware independence, our global reach, and our deep customer relationships and industry experience.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had 17,035 U.S. and other patents and 618 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.\n\nWe focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.\n\nWe and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop noninfringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.\n\nWith respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS offerings.

(f/k/a Cree, Inc.), GlobalFoundries Inc., Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Heidenhain Corporation, HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd., iC-Haus GmbH, Intel Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., MaxLinear, Inc., Marvell Technology, Inc., MediaTek Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Microchip Technology Incorporated, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, OSRAM Licht AG, Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Sumitomo Corporation, Synaptics Incorporated, TDK-EPC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc. and II-VI Incorporated. We compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise, FBAR technology, amplifier design, module integration, proprietary materials processes, multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design, our broad product portfolio, support of key industry standards, reputation for quality products, and our customer relationships.\n\nIn the infrastructure software market, we compete with large enterprise software vendors who continue to expand their product and service offerings and consolidate offerings into broad product lines, and smaller, niche players focused on specific markets. Our primary competitors are Atlassian Corporation, Plc, BMC Software Inc., BeyondTrust Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk Software, Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation, Micro Focus International plc, Microsoft Corporation, New Relic, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Proofpoint, Inc., Rocket Software, Inc., SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc., ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds Corporation, Splunk, Inc. and Zscaler, Inc. We compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools, breadth and synergy of offerings, our platform and hardware independence, our global reach, and our deep customer relationships and industry experience.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had 17,035 U.S. and other patents and 618 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.\n\nWe focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.\n\nWe and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop noninfringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.\n\nWith respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow",

      "question": "What specific financial and operational risks do Broadcom (AVGO) and IBM face from IT system failures, and how do these risks reflect vulnerabilities in their respective business models as disclosed in their 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Broadcom (AVGO) faces financial risks from IT system failures due to potential uninsured losses and increased fixed costs relative to revenue, as highlighted in its 2022 10-K filing. These risks stem from the company's reliance on proprietary manufacturing facilities and internal IT systems that, if disrupted, could delay production, reduce product yields, and impair its ability to meet customer demand, all of which could materially affect its results of operations. IBM also faces significant financial and reputational risks from IT system failures, including potential liability, litigation, regulatory action, and loss of customer trust, especially as its systems are used in critical operations across highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare. Both companies rely heavily on IT infrastructure, and any failure or breach could disrupt operations, damage brand reputation, and lead to substantial remediation costs, reflecting a shared vulnerability in their technology-dependent business models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AVGO's 10-K - AVGO mentions that IT system failures could lead to uninsured losses, increased fixed costs, and delays in production, all of which could materially affect its financial performance.",
        "Step 2: Extract from IBM's 10-K - IBM notes that cybersecurity breaches or IT system failures could lead to liability, litigation, regulatory action, and reputational damage, particularly in critical sectors like finance and healthcare.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face operational and financial risks from IT system failures, though the nature of these risks reflects their distinct business models: AVGO's is tied to internal manufacturing and supply chain continuity, while IBM's is tied to data integrity and client trust in high-stakes environments."

We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are located in California and the Pacific Rim region, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the Czech Republic, India, Israel and the U.S., with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas, and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.\n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses, especially our Colorado, Singapore, Malaysia and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. To date, we have not experienced a material event, however such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks. Such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.\n\n## An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur business depends on various internally managed IT systems and outsourced IT services, including cloudbased and other critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, financial reporting, product orders and shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network development, network monitoring and electronic communication services, as well as third-party data centers. Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect. Although these systems are designed to protect and secure our customers', suppliers' and employees' confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use (including technologies produced by us) have occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmanaged, could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed.",

          "chunk_text": "## Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\n\nCybersecurity and Privacy Considerations Could Impact the Company's Business: There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers, hacktivists, nation states and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure. Attacks also include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. Cyber threats are continually evolving, making it difficult to defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time. The  company's products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors. Successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, including key innovations in artificial intelligence, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the company's industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the fastpaced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities with the potential for exploitation, and while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate such events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse effect in the future.\n\nAs a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company's business, including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations,",

      "answer": "Microsoft expenses software development costs internally until technological feasibility is established, at which point those costs are capitalized and amortized over the product's estimated life. This policy is applied because Microsoft determines technological feasibility shortly before product release. In contrast, NVIDIA acquired an IPR&D project from Mellanox valued at $630 million that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Since the project was not yet technologically feasible, NVIDIA classified it as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is not amortized but instead tested for impairment annually or when triggering events occur. The financial implication for Microsoft is that costs are expensed earlier, reducing short-term profitability, while NVIDIA deferred recognition of amortization expense on the $630 million asset until the project reaches technological feasibility, potentially preserving earnings in the near term.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Impairment of Investment Securities\n\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value  is  less  than  cost.  This  determination  requires  significant  judgment.  In  making  this  judgment,  we  employ  a  systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is  tested  for  impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development  issues  have  been  resolved  through  coding  and  testing.  Generally,  this  occurs  shortly  before  the  products  are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.",

IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PCbased distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.\n\nOur database, business intelligence,  and  data  warehousing  solutions  offerings  compete  with  products  from  IBM,  Oracle,  SAP, Snowflake, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete  against  offerings  from  Adobe,  IBM,  Oracle,  and  other  companies,  and  also  against  open-source  projects,  including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails.\n\nWe believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering  superior  applications,  development  tools,  compatibility  with  a  broad  base  of  hardware  and  software  applications, security, and manageability.\n\nOur  Enterprise  Services  business  competes  with  a  wide  range  of  companies  that  provide  strategy  and  business  planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.\n\n## More Personal Computing\n\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n- Windows,  including  Windows  OEM  licensing  ('Windows  OEM')  and  other  non-volume  licensing  of  the  Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.\n- Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.\n- Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games  and  in-game  content),  Xbox  Game  Pass  and  other  subscriptions,  Xbox  Cloud  Gaming,  third-party  disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.\n- Search and news advertising.\n\n## Windows\n\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:\n\n- The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.\n- Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.\n- Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.\n- Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.\n- Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.\n- Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.\n- Constraints in the supply chain of device components.\n- Piracy.",

We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers  and  licensors  designing  discrete  and  integrated  GPUs,  custom  chips  and  other  accelerated computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\n- suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc.,  AMD,  Broadcom  Inc., Intel, Qualcomm  Incorporated, Renesas  Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\n- suppliers  of  interconnect,  switch  and  cable  solutions  such  as  AMD,  Applied  Optoelectronics,  Inc.,  Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe  rely  primarily  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  employee  and  third-party  nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;\n- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n- the  commercial  significance  of  our  operations  and  our  competitors'  operations  in  particular  countries  and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods.

      "answer": "Microsoft expenses all software development costs until technological feasibility is reached, which typically occurs shortly before product release, and only begins to capitalize and amortize these costs after that point. In contrast, NVIDIA has an IPR&D project related to next-generation interconnect products that had not reached technological feasibility at the acquisition date, and therefore it is recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset valued at $630 million and not amortized until feasibility is achieved. This means Microsoft recognizes development costs as expenses earlier in the product lifecycle, while NVIDIA delays any amortization of its $630 million IPR&D asset until the project reaches technological feasibility, creating a significant timing difference in how each company reflects such costs in their financial statements.",

Research and development expenses also include third-party development  and  programming  costs,  localization  costs  incurred  to  translate  software  for  international  markets,  and  the amortization  of  purchased  software  code  and  services  content.  Such  costs  related  to  software  development  are  included  in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally  shortly  before  the  products  are  released  to  production.  Once  technological  feasibility  is  reached,  such  costs  are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nSales  and  marketing  expenses  include  payroll,  employee  benefits,  stock-based  compensation  expense,  and  other  headcountrelated expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation  cost  for  stock  awards,  which  include  restricted  stock  units  ('RSUs')  and  performance  stock  units  ('PSUs'),  is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo  valuation  model.  Compensation  cost  for  RSUs  is  recognized  using  the  straight-line  method  and  for  PSUs  is  recognized using the accelerated method.\n\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP') is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely  than  not  that  a  tax  benefit  will  not  be  realized. All  deferred  income  taxes  are  classified  as  long-term  in  our  consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\n## Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.",

The  recast  of  these  prior  period amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income  statements,  or  consolidated  cash  flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the  nature  and  timing  of  satisfaction  of  performance  obligations,  and  determining  the  standalone  selling  price  ('SSP')  of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates;  when  technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn  July  2022,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  server  and  network  equipment.  Due  to  investments  in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses  are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  applications,  server  applications,  business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.",

Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps:\n\n- identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the  hardware  product.  Invoices  for  license  support  and  hardware  support  contracts  are  generally  invoiced  annually  in  advance. Cloud  SaaS  and  cloud  infrastructure  contracts  are  generally  invoiced  annually,  quarterly  or  monthly  in  advance.  Services  are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.\n\nOur revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are  expected to continue to be insignificant. Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services\n\nRevenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud  services  are  delivered,  beginning  on  the  date  our  service  is  made  available  to  a  customer.  We  recognize  revenue  ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period. Revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support\n\nOracle's primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period, if and when they are available, and hardware product repairs, as applicable.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States  requires  us  to  make  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Note  2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  describes  the  significant accounting  policies  and  methods  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  accounting  policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions,  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  and  actual  results  could  differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\n\nThe  inputs  into  certain  of  our  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  considered  the  economic  implications  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, including the associated impact of supply constraints, on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2022. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together  with  other  resources  that  are  readily  available  and  whether  our  commitment  to  transfer  the  product  or  service  to  the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\n\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  in  exchange  for  those  products  or  services.  Transfer  of  control  occurs  once  the customer  has  the  contractual  right  to  use  the  product,  generally  upon  shipment,  electronic  delivery  (or  when  the  software  is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control,  with  the  associated  software  maintenance  revenue  recognized  ratably  over  the  contract  term  as  services  and  software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\n\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to  for  the  promised  goods  or  services  based  on  standalone  selling  prices  (SSP).  SSP  is  estimated  for  each  distinct  performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n\nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.",

These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment  of  a  particular  transaction  is  specifically  dictated  by  GAAP  and  does  not  require  management's  judgment  in  its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur sources of revenues include:\n\n- cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud licenses and onpremise licenses, which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;\n- hardware  revenues,  which  include  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and\n- services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting and advanced customer services.\n\nLicense  support  revenues  are  typically  generated  through  the  sale  of  license  support  contracts  related  to  cloud  license  and  onpremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\n\nCloud  services  revenues  include  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  deliver  applications  and  infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.\n\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, onpremise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer's option.\n\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer  servers,  storage,  and  industry-specific  hardware.  Our  hardware  support  offerings  generally  provide  customers  with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.\n\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services.",

We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.",

The Bridge Credit Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, net cash proceeds received by us from certain debt and equity issuances shall result in mandatory prepayments or commitment reductions under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The proceeds of borrowings under the Bridge Facility were used to finance the acquisition of Cerner, our refinancing of indebtedness in connection with such acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. All amounts borrowed under the Bridge Credit Agreement will become due on March 7, 2023, unless settled earlier pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Credit Agreement. Interest is based on either (a) a Term SOFR-based formula plus a margin of 100.0 basis points to 137.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin of 0.0 basis point to 37.5 basis points, depending on the same such credit rating, each as set forth in the Bridge Credit Agreement.\n\nNo amounts were outstanding pursuant to either of the credit agreements as of May 31, 2022. On June 8, 2022, we drew down the full amount of the Bridge Credit Agreement to finance the acquisition of Cerner.\n\nEach of the abovementioned credit agreements contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including the requirement that the ratio of 'Consolidated EBITDA' to 'Consolidated Net Interest Expense' (each term as defined in the respective credit agreements) of Oracle and its subsidiaries shall not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter during the period that the credit agreement is effective. If an event of default occurs under one of the credit agreements and is not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the applicable credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments under that agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the two credit agreements' covenants as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## Commercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes\n\nOur existing $3.0 billion commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private  placement  exemption  from  the  registration  requirements  under  federal  and  state  securities  laws  pursuant  to  dealer agreements with various banks and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas.

      "answer": "AMD relies heavily on OEM partners to distribute its server CPUs, GPU accelerators, and other data center-focused products to hyperscale data centers, which are major consumers of these technologies. Microsoft, while partnering with these same OEMs through its platform devices, increasingly competes with them by expanding its own first-party device portfolio. This dual dynamic\u2014cooperating with OEMs to support Microsoft platforms while also competing with them in the device market\u2014has attracted regulatory scrutiny, particularly under competition laws in the EU and Asia. The tension arises because Microsoft\u2019s ability to offer competitive devices and maintain platform attractiveness could be impacted by how OEM partners prioritize or integrate AMD\u2019s technologies, especially under regulatory constraints that limit self-preferencing or restrict data use. This creates a multi-hop causal chain where AMD\u2019s OEM-driven distribution model indirectly affects Microsoft\u2019s strategic and regulatory positioning in the market.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial and consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\n## LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\n\nGovernment enforcement under competition laws and new market regulation may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Gov ernments are activ ely enforcing competition laws and regulations and enacting new regulations to interv ene in digital markets, and this includes markets such as the EU, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitiv e conduct. U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities hav e prev iously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\n\nFor example, the European Commission ('the Commission') has designated Windows and LinkedIn as core platform serv ices subject to obligations under the EU Digital Markets Act, which prohibits certain self-preferencing behav iors and places limitations on certain data use among other obligations. The Commission also continues to closely scrutinize the design of high-v olume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, av ailable to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Microsoft 365 and Windows can receiv e significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws.\n\nOur portfolio of first-party dev ices continues to grow; at the same time, our OEM partners offer a large v ariety of dev ices for our platforms. As a result, we increasingly both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign gov ernments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, hav e adv anced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\n\nCompetition law enforcement actions and court decisions along with new market regulations may result in fines or hinder our ability to prov ide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiv eness of our products and the rev enue that comes from them. New competition law actions or obligations under market regulation schemes could be initiated, potentially using prev ious actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to av oid them, could adv ersely affect us in a v ariety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the v alue of our assets, adv ersely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their v alue, which may adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ('FCPA') and other anti-corruption laws and regulations ('Anti-Corruption Laws') prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, v endors, or agents, and the accounting prov isions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receiv e inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activ ities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receiv e such reports directly and inv estigate them, and also cooperate with inv estigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directiv e, initiated in 2021, which presents compliance challenges as it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also hav e competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselv es. While we dev ote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and hav e implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusiv e activ ity, our employees, partners, vendors, or agents may v iolate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation, which could adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 'Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn  this  section,  we  will  describe  the  general  financial  condition  and  the  results  of  operations  of Adv anced  Micro  Dev ices,  Inc.  and  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectiv ely, 'us,' 'our' or 'AMD'), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and  2022  that  are  not  included  in  this  Form  10-K  can  be  found  in  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2024, we deliv ered strong annual rev enue growth with net rev enue increasing 14% to $25.8 billion, compared to $22.7 billion in 2023. T his growth was driv en by the performance of our Data Center and Client segments. Data Center net rev enue of $12.6 billion increased by 94% compared to $6.5 billion in 2023, driv en by higher sales of our AMD Instinct\u2122 GPUs and AMD EPYC\u2122 CPUs. Client segment net rev enue of $7.1 billion in 2024 increased by 52% compared to $4.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher sales of our AMD Ryzen\u2122 mobile and desktop processors. The increase in annual net rev enue was  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  net  rev enue  in  our  Gaming  and  Embedded  segments.  Gaming  net  rev enue  of  $2.6  billion  decreased  by  58% compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net rev enue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product rev enue. Embedded net rev enue of $3.6 billion decreased by 33% compared to net rev enue of $5.3 billion in 2023, as customers normalized their inv entory lev els.\n\nDuring the year, we successfully launched multiple leadership products and made significant progress executing our AI strategy. One of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our  Data  Center  segment.  The  demand for  our  Data  Center AI  accelerator  products  was  v ery  strong  led  by  large hyperscale  cloud  customers  deploying  our  AMD  Instinct  MI300X   GPU  accelerators.  During  the  year,  we  unv eiled  an  accelerated  AMD  Instinct accelerator roadmap to deliv er an annual cadence of leadership AI solutions. T o further expand our high-performance serv er CPU portfolio, we launched our  5th  Gen  AMD  EPYC\u2122  processors,  formerly  codenamed  'Turin,'  built  with  our  latest  'Z en  5'  core  architecture  designed  to  deliv er  leadership performance and efficiency.\n\nWe took a major step in our AI PC roadmap with the launch of AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors that combine leadership compute capabilities based on our 'Zen 5' architecture and an industry-leading neural processing unit (NPU) powered by our X DNA 2 architecture for next-generation AI PCs. We added to our Ryzen family of desktop CPUs with the Ryzen 9000 series processors for laptop and desktop PCs that deliv er leadership performance in gaming, productiv ity and content creation. In our Gaming segment, we extended our multigenerational partnership with Sony as they introduced the PlayStation\u00ae 5 Pro, which features a new AMD semi-custom SoC designed to deliv er increases in graphics and ray tracing performance to enable AIdriv en upscaling.\n\nWe expanded our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions with the launch of the new Versal\u2122 Series Gen 2 dev ices, including the new Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptiv e SoCs, which bring preprocessing, AI inference, and postprocessing together in a single dev ice for end-to-end acceleration of AI-driv en embedded systems.\n\nT o execute our AI strategy, we brought together multiple AI teams across AMD to driv e dev elopment of a comprehensiv e software ecosystem spanning our  full  product  portfolio.  We  made  sev eral  key  optimizations  and  introduced  new  features  in  the  latest  AMD  ROCm\u2122  software  that  increased performance  in  key  generativ e  AI  workloads,  expanded  support  and  optimization  for  additional  frameworks  and  libraries,  and  simplified  the  ov erall developer experience. We also made strategic inv estments to further expand our AI software capabilities with the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI enables customers to accelerate dev elopment and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has  also  dev eloped  a  software  stack  used  to  train  multiple  state-of-the-art  large  language  models  (LLMs)  on  AMD  Instinct  accelerators  that  can accelerate the dev elopment of highly-performant AMD training solutions.",

Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the ov erall activ e user base through X box enabled content, av ailability of games, prov iding exclusiv e game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the dev ices used to access our content and serv ices, and the ability to create new experiences.\n\n## Search and News Advertising\n\nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliv er relev ant search, nativ e, and display adv ertising to a global audience. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Copilot are key tools to enable user acquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated deliv ery of digital adv ertising solutions. In addition to first-party tools, we hav e sev eral partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we prov ide and monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relev ant content on adv ertising offerings.\n\n## Competition\n\nWindows faces competition from v arious software products and from alternativ e platforms and dev ices, mainly from Apple and Google, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint competes with CrowdStrike on endpoint security solutions. We believ e Windows competes effectiv ely by giv ing customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productiv ity.\n\nDevices face competition from v arious computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innov ativ e technologies across v arious price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming serv ices face competition from v arious online gaming ecosystems and game streaming serv ices, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other prov iders of entertainment serv ices such as v ideo streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which hav e a large, established base of customers. We believ e our gaming platform is effectiv ely positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitiv e products and serv ices based on significant innov ation in hardware architecture, user interface, dev eloper tools, online gaming and entertainment serv ices, and continued strong content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google, OpenAI, and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that prov ide content and online offerings to end users.",

      "question": "Considering AMD's dependency on Sony for its semi-custom SoC products in the Gaming segment and Microsoft's competition with Sony in the gaming console market, how might fluctuations in Sony console sales impact AMD's revenue differently compared to Microsoft's gaming revenue?",
      "answer": "Fluctuations in Sony console sales could directly affect AMD's revenue since the success of AMD's semi-custom SoC products is tied to consumer market conditions, including the success of Sony's game console systems. If Sony console sales decline, AMD's Gaming segment revenue could decrease due to reduced demand for its semi-custom chips. Conversely, if Microsoft competes effectively and gains market share in the console market, its Gaming revenue could increase. Thus, a drop in Sony console sales could negatively impact AMD while potentially benefiting Microsoft, depending on how market share shifts.",

If we are unable to manage the risks related to the v olatility of the cryptocurrency mining market (including potential actions by global monetary authorities), our GPU business could be materially adv ersely affected. T he success of our semi-custom SoC products in our Gaming segment is dependent on securing customers for our semicustom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft.  Our  Embedded  segment  primarily  includes  embedded  CPUs  and  GPUs, APUs,  FPGAs  and Adaptiv e  SoC  products  some  of  which  are subject to macroeconomic trends and v olatile business conditions. T o the extent our embedded customers are faced with higher inv entory lev els, they may choose to draw down their existing inv entory and order less of our products. For example, our Embedded segment rev enue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inv entory lev els.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.\n\nOur  success  depends  to  a  significant  extent  on  the  dev elopment,  qualification,  implementation  and  acceptance  of  new  product  designs  and improvements that prov ide v alue to our customers. Our ability to identify industry changes, and adapt our strategy to dev elop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet ev olv ing industry trends and requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiv eness in our target markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the ev olv ing needs of industry changes or that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innov ativ e products and technologies that prov ide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in identifying, dev eloping, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that prov ide v alue to our customers and address these new trends, or if we fail to predict which new form factors, product features preferences or requirements consumers will adopt and adapt our business accordingly, we may lose competitiv e positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial inv estments in research and dev elopment, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop,  obtain  or  successfully  implement  new  products  and  technologies  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  they  will  be  well-receiv ed  by  our  customers. Moreover,  our  inv estments  in  new  products  and  technologies  inv olv e  certain  risks  and  uncertainties  and  could  disrupt  our  ongoing  business.  New inv estments may not generate sufficient rev enue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may div ert our limited resources and distract management from our  current  operations.  We  cannot  be  certain  that  our  ongoing  inv estments  in  new  products  and  technologies  will  be  successful,  will  meet  our expectations and will not adv ersely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, as part of our perv asiv e AI strategy, we have a portfolio of hardware products and software tools to allow our customers to dev elop scalable and perv asiv e AI solutions. We are activ ely building AI  capabilities  into  our  products,  but  there  can  be  no  assurance  about  the  rate  and  pace  of  adoption  of  such  product  offerings.  In  our  Data  Center segment,  we  offer  products  that  are  optimized  for  generativ e AI  applications  and  since  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  we  hav e  experienced  significant demand for our AI accelerators. The demand for such products in part will depend on the extent to which our customers utilize generativ e AI solutions in a wide v ariety of applications, and both the near-term and long-term trajectory of such generativ e AI solutions is unknown. If we fail to dev elop and timely offer or deploy such products and technologies, keep pace with the product offerings of our competitors, or adapt to unexpected changes in industry standards  or  disruptiv e  technological  innov ation,  our  business  could  be  adv ersely  affected.

Texas Instruments (TXN), on the other hand, states that about 90% of its revenue is exposed to international labor conditions, indicating a much higher dependency on global labor stability. This means that labor disruptions could have a significantly greater financial impact on Texas Instruments than on Adobe due to the larger proportion of revenue at risk. The difference in geographic exposure\u201443% for Adobe versus 90% for Texas Instruments\u2014demonstrates that while both companies face international labor risks, the potential financial consequences are far more pronounced for Texas Instruments.",

Further, restrictions in place for the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted and could continue to result in our inability to negotiate in person, even as we return many employees to their offices. As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations. Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter's total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry. Our extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.\n\n## If  our  customers  fail  to  renew  subscriptions  in  accordance  with  our  expectations,  our  future  revenue  and  operating  results could suffer.\n\nOur Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings typically involve subscription-based offerings pursuant to product and service agreements. Revenue from our subscription customers is generally recognized ratably over the term of their agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. Our varied customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of our subscription-based agreements complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates.\n\nOur customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription offerings, the prices of offerings and those offered by our competitors, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and  services,  decreases  in  the  size  of  our  customer  base,  reductions  in  our  customers'  spending  levels  or  declines  in  customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected and may continue to affect certain sectors of the economy disproportionately.

Risk factors\n\nYou should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\n## Risks related to our business and industry\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain.\n\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially long-term. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, related third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. We have experienced, and continue to experience, short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions.\n\nWe have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; shipments of products to China-based customers represent about 25% of our revenue. Certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. Trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China, cause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nWe are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",

      "answer": "Adobe's investment portfolio, valued as of December 3, 2021, includes asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and U.S. Treasury securities, and is subject to risks from financial market deterioration, which could lead to variability in other income and expense. Adobe follows an investment policy to mitigate interest rate and credit risk by limiting exposure to any one issuer or asset class. In contrast, Texas Instruments' investment policy focuses on using low-cost, broad-market index funds and maintains a greater proportion of fixed income securities to align with changes in liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. This approach is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of plan assets and liabilities. Therefore, while Adobe's investment strategy emphasizes diversification and credit quality to manage market risks, Texas Instruments tailors its portfolio composition to directly counterbalance discount rate-driven liability changes, reflecting different mechanisms for addressing interest rate sensitivity.",

      "answer": "The combined principal amount of senior unsecured notes is $4.15 billion for ADBE and $4.5 billion for TXN, totaling $8.65 billion. ADBE\u2019s debt maturity structure is concentrated in a single undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility and $4.15 billion in senior unsecured notes without specific maturity breakdowns in the excerpt, which implies a potentially less staggered exposure to interest rates. TXN, on the other hand, issued multiple tranches of senior unsecured notes with specific maturities (2025, 2026, 2029, 2030, 2031, and 2051), creating a more diversified maturity schedule. This diversified structure likely reduces TXN\u2019s immediate exposure to interest rate fluctuations compared to ADBE, which may face more concentrated refinancing risk depending on the terms of its undrawn credit agreement.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - ADBE has $4.15 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding.",

        "Step 3: Sum the two amounts to determine the combined principal: $4.15B (ADBE) + $4.5B (TXN) = $8.65B.",
        "Step 4: Compare maturity structures - ADBE\u2019s $4.15 billion in senior notes are not broken down by maturity in the excerpt, and it has a $1 billion undrawn revolving credit facility.

      "question": "How does ACN's reliance on subcontractors for large-scale client engagements potentially intersect with Texas Instruments' (TXN) use of subcontractors to supplement internal manufacturing capacity, and what risks does this shared dependency introduce to each company's profitability and operational performance?",
      "answer": "ACN depends on subcontractors to deliver large, complex client engagements that involve business transformation and cloud migration, and its profitability is directly tied to the subcontractors\u2019 ability to deliver services timely, at anticipated costs, and in accordance with project requirements. If subcontractors fail to meet expectations, ACN may face delivery inefficiencies, increased costs, or contractual penalties, which could materially affect its profitability. On the other hand, Texas Instruments (TXN) uses subcontractors selectively to supplement its internal manufacturing capacity, particularly for wafer fabrication, assembly, and testing. While TXN maintains control over the majority of its production internally, reliance on subcontractors introduces risks related to quality, delivery timelines, and cost predictability. The shared dependency on subcontractors exposes both companies to operational risks, though the financial impact differs: ACN faces direct profitability risks due to performance-based contracts, while TXN risks potential disruptions in supply chain reliability and manufacturing efficiency.",

          "chunk_text": "Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs and optimize our business. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.\n\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. Our contract profitability  is highly  dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nMoreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy  these measures, it could significantly  reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms, any of which could significantly affect our profitability. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients' actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nWe are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business. The scale and complexity of these projects present risks in execution and profitability challenges as a result of the costs we incur and investments we make at the beginning of these transactions. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or provide anticipated productivity gains, or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. A ny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effectiv e tax  rate in the future could be adv ersely  affected by  challenges to our intercompany  transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change",

      "question": "How do environmental risk disclosures in ACN's and TXN's 2024 filings reflect different approaches to managing environmental liabilities, given ACN's exposure to client-related environmental risks in its contractual agreements and TXN's investments in emissions reduction technology at its 300mm wafer fabrication facilities?",
      "answer": "ACN's 2024 filing highlights its exposure to environmental risks through contractual agreements, noting that its services\u2014such as operational technology, digital manufacturing, and robotics\u2014could result in significant legal liability if client systems fail or cause environmental harm. This exposure arises from ACN's deep involvement in client operations, including managing critical functions and contributing to product design. Meanwhile, TXN's filing details its proactive investments in reducing emissions at its 300mm wafer fabrication facilities, such as RFAB2 in Texas and LFAB1 and LFAB2 in Utah, by installing state-of-the-art emissions reduction technology and retrofitting existing equipment. While ACN faces potential liabilities tied to client operations, TXN focuses on internal mitigation through facility upgrades and sustainable practices, reflecting two distinct strategies for managing environmental risk in the Information Technology sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from ACN's filing - ACN may face environmental liability if its services or solutions cause property damage or if client systems fail based on ACN's work, especially in areas like operational technology and digital manufacturing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from TXN's filing - TXN is investing in emissions reduction technology at its 300mm wafer fabrication facilities, including RFAB2 in Texas and LFAB1/LFAB2 in Utah, to address environmental risks.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While ACN's environmental risk stems from its contractual obligations and client-facing operations, TXN manages risk through internal manufacturing improvements, showing different approaches to environmental liability in the IT sector."

In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100% of the equity. This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing working capital adjustments. A lternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability  or competitiv e position in specific markets or serv ices.\n\nWe also periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and people, the diversion of management's attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. A fter reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability  with respect to the div ested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the div ested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. A ny divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.\n\nWe are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation inv olv ing current and former employees, clients, ecosystem partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management's attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties, debarment or injunctive relief against us. A ny claims or litigation, ev en if fully  indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\n\nWe could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, ecosystem partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients, or if our serv ices or solutions cause bodily injuries to our people, clients, or the public or property damage. For example, by taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients' businesses, including functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, by contributing to the design, development, manufacturing and/or engineering of client products, or by providing various operational technology, digital manufacturing and robotics or other industrial automation equipment solutions, and advisory, management and engineering services for infrastructure projects, we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational, regulatory, reputational or other risks specific to these areas, including risks related to data security, product liability, health and safety, hazardous materials and other environmental risks. A  failure of a client's sy stem, product or infrastructure based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn order to remain competitive, we increasingly enter into agreements based on our clients' contract terms after conducting an assessment of the risk of doing so, which may expose us to additional risk. In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the industry. We may commit to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability  is not adequately  limited through the terms of our agreements, liability  limitations are not enforced or a third party  alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. M oreover, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas.",

In contrast, Texas Instruments (TXN) faces risks related to third-party patent claims and potential indemnification obligations, particularly in jurisdictions with less predictable intellectual property laws. While ACN's risk centers on protecting its internally developed IP, TXN's exposure involves external IP conflicts, which could lead to legal liabilities, injunctions, or reputational damage.

If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.\n\n## If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.\n\nAs of A ugust 31, 2024, we had approximately 774,000 employees worldwide. Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. A s our organization grows and evolves, it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge or to effectively change the strategy, operations or culture of our Company in a timely manner. It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectiv ely  manage and monitor our people and operations, effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, and motivate, engage and retain our people, particularly given our world-wide operations, rate of new hires, and the significant percentage of our employees who have the option to work remotely. The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of sensitive or confidential information entrusted to us, or obtained inappropriately, or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data and proprietary information. Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites and unapproved technologies, such as public-facing, free generative A I tools, by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.\n\n## We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.\n\nWe expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. We have increased and may again in the future increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities. These acquisitions and other transactions and investments involve challenges and risks, such as that we may not succeed in completing targeted transactions, including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive, or achieve desired results of operations. To the extent that we increase the capital invested in such opportunities, as we did in fiscal 2024, the risks associated with such investments, further described below, also increase.\n\nFurthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire, and these risks may be magnified by the size and number of transactions we have executed. Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management's attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently  integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. The loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses. Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, enhancing controls, procedures and policies including those related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability as these costs and expenses grow along with the increased capital invested in such acquisitions and joint ventures. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.\n\nIn some cases, we have failed to, and may in the future fail to fully realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company's known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties. In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities, or from an acquisition's controls related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security environment. The number of transactions we execute annually may increase this risk. If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected regulatory or legal exposure, including litigation with new or existing clients, unfavorable accounting treatment,",

Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on our management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  Ex change Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  'Ex change Act')),  are  effective  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities  and  Ex change  Commission  rules  and  forms  and  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  principal  ex ecutive  officer  and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement's report on our internal control over financial reporting and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting are set forth, respectively, on page 57 under the caption 'Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting' and on page 54 of this report.\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission staff, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to ex ceed one year from the date of the acquisition. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 27, 2024 did not include the internal controls of Splunk, which we acquired on March 18, 2024. We have included the  financial  results  of  Splunk  in  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  since  the  date  of  acquisition.  Total  assets  and  total  revenues  of  Splunk  represented approximately 3 percent of each of our total consolidated assets and total consolidated revenue as of and for the year ended July 27, 2024.\n\n## Item 9B. Other Information\n\n## Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) informed us of the adoption or termination of a 'Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement' or 'non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,' each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\n\n## Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n\nNot applicable.",

      "answer": "As of the end of their respective fiscal years in 2024, AMD held $116 million and Cisco held $371 million in Non-U.S. government and agency securities, totaling $487 million. In 2023, AMD held $135 million and Cisco held $363 million in these securities, totaling $498 million. Therefore, the combined value decreased by $11 million from 2023 to 2024.",

      "answer": "The combined fair value of Non-U.S. government and agency securities held by AMD and CSCO is $558 million. This is calculated by adding AMD's $195 million in Non-U.S. government and agency securities (as of December 28, 2024) to CSCO's $363 million in the same category (as of July 29, 2024). Over the same period, AMD's U.S. government and agency securities decreased from $2,490 million (as of December 30, 2023) to $544 million (as of December 28, 2024), a decrease of $1,946 million.

        "Step 4: Calculate the combined fair value of Non-U.S. government and agency securities: $195 million (AMD) + $363 million (CSCO) = $558 million.",

      "answer": "AMD owns 1 million square feet of facilities out of a total global facilities space of 6 million square feet, meaning owned facilities comprise approximately 16.7% of AMD's total facilities. In comparison, Cisco explicitly states that it owns facilities in the surrounding areas of San Jose, California, but does not provide exact square footage. However, Cisco notes that it leases office space in many U.S. locations, suggesting a more mixed ownership strategy with a focus on leasing outside of key owned sites like those in San Jose.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AMD's 10-K, extract total global facilities space (6 million square feet) and owned space (1 million square feet) to calculate the percentage of owned facilities.",
        "Step 2: From Cisco's 10-K, extract the statement that it owns facilities in the surrounding areas of San Jose, California, but does not provide exact square footage.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities\n\n## Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities\n\nWe utilize T aiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of wafers for our HPC, FPGA and Adaptiv e SoC products and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF), with respect to wafer purchases for our HPC products at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes. Additionally, we utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the production of our ICs in the form of programmable logic dev ices.\n\n## Other Third-Party Manufacturers\n\nWe outsource board-lev el graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.\n\n## Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities\n\nWafers for our products are either sorted by the foundry or deliv ered by the foundry to our assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) partners or subcontractors located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two ATMP joint v entures (collectiv ely,  the  AT MP  JVs)  with  T ongfu  Microelectronics  Co.,  Ltd.  T he  ATMP  JVs,  Siliconware  Precision  Industries  Ltd.  (SPIL)  and  King  Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) provide ATMP services for our products.\n\n## Intellectual Property and Licensing\n\nWe rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 7,500 patents in the United States and approximately 1,900 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we hav e filed  corresponding  applications  in  foreign  jurisdictions.  Including  United  States  and  foreign  matters,  we  hav e  approximately  18,800  patent  matters worldwide consisting of approximately 13,200 issued patents and 5,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inv entions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believ e that any indiv idual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we hav e numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements  with  other  companies  under  which  we  both  transfer  and  receiv e  technology  and  intellectual  property  rights.  We  hav e  acquired  v arious licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and dev ices. T hese licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We hav e also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.\n\n## Backlog\n\nSales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current deliv ery or agreements cov ering purchases ov er a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide v isibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicativ e of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be rev ised or canceled without penalty.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur operating results tend to v ary seasonally. Historically, our net rev enue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs  of  December  28,  2024,  we  had  approximately  28,000  employees  in  our  global  workforce.  We  believ e  we  are  at  our  best  when  our  culture  of innov ation, creativ e minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open env ironment. Areas of focus for us include the following:\n\n## Mission, Culture, and Engagement\n\nOur History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products.

Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nWe rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary software in electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The manufacturing process also uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to International Organization for Standardization 9001 standards.\n\nOur arrangements with contract manufacturers generally  provide  for  quality,  cost,  and  delivery  requirements,  as  well  as  manufacturing  process  terms,  such  as inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-term contracts with any contract manufacturers. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis. These arrangements with contract manufacturers generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time.\n\n## Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing\n\nWe seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.\n\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.\n\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent  and  other  intellectual  property  rights.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  patents  and  other  proprietary  rights  will  not  be  challenged,  invalidated,  or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' including the risk factors entitled 'Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,' 'We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others,' and 'We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.'\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous regulations and laws in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business. Many of these regulations and laws are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by courts and regulators, remain uncertain. These regulations and laws involve a variety of matters including  privacy,  data  protection  and  personal  information,  cybersecurity,  operational  resilience,  artificial  intelligence,  tax ,  trade,  encryption  technology, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human rights, product certification, and national security.",

Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A  decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results.\n\n## Our business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\n\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents.

Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk management and strategy\n\nWe have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively address circumstances that arise when unexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These include processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard for Information Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk management and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.\n\nIdentify ing,  assessing,  and  managing  cybersecurity  risk  is  integrated  into  our  overall  risk  management  systems  and  processes,  and  we  have  in  place cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy and cybersecurity laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.\n\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the supplier and data they process on our behalf, the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the supplier and data they process on our behalf. We routinely assess our high-risk suppliers' conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), and we evaluate them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements.\n\nRefer to 'Item 1A .

Business\n\n## Our Company\n\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems.  NVIDIA  is now a full-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\n\nOur full-stack includes the foundational CUDA  programming model that runs on all NVIDIA  GPUs, as well as hundreds of domain-specific software libraries, software development kits, or SDKs, and A pplication Programming Interfaces, or APIs. This deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance and eases the deployment of NVIDIA  accelerated computing for computationally intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, or A I, model training and inference, data analytics, scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimizations to address industries ranging from healthcare and telecom to automotive and manufacturing.\n\nOur  data-center-scale  offerings  are  comprised  of  compute  and  networking  solutions  that  can  scale  to  tens  of  thousands  of  GPU-accelerated  servers interconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture and scale is needed for the development and deployment of modern A I applications.\n\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. T oday , it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep learning algorithms. This form of A I, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots, and selfdriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative A I, which can create new content such as text,  code,  images,  audio,  video,  molecule  structures,  and  recommendation  systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as products, services, media, or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user's preferences.\n\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy , bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and networking and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\n\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $58.2 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way for the emergence of modern AI. In 2012, the A lexNet neural network, trained on NV IDIA  GPUs, won the ImageNet computer image recognition competition, marking the 'Big Bang' moment of AI. We introduced our first T ensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of A I, and our first autonomous driving system-on-chips, or SoC, in 2018. Our acquisition of M ellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking, enabled our platforms to be data center scale, and led to the introduction of a new processor class - the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past 5 years, we have built full software stacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA  to bring AI to the world's largest industries, including NV IDIA  DRIV E stack for autonomous driving, Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for industrial digitalization; and introduced the NV IDIA  A I Enterprise software - essentially an operating system for enterprise A I applications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center CPU, Grace, built for giant-scale A I and high performance computing, or HPC. With a strong engineering culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technology innovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking, software and algorithms. M ore than half of our engineers work on software.\n\nThe world's leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale accelerated computing platforms to enable, accelerate, develop, or enrich the services and offerings they deliver to billions of end users, including A I solutions and assistants, A I foundation models, search, recommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, and translation.\n\nEnterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new generative and agentic A I-enabled products and services, and/or to dramatically accelerate and reduce the costs of their workloads and workflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new A I assistants, chatbots, and agents; the transportation industry for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for accelerated and computer-aided drug discovery; and the financial services industry for customer support and fraud detection.",

      "answer": "Broadcom faces financial risk because its semiconductor customers are not obligated to purchase specific quantities of products, and even when they do, pricing is often fixed regardless of volume. This uncertainty is amplified for AI-related products like custom AI accelerators or XPUs, where design wins require significant resource allocation and may not result in revenue. NVIDIA, on the other hand, emphasizes that obtaining design wins for its accelerated computing platforms is a lengthy process that does not guarantee revenue and may delay or prevent future design wins. Both companies highlight that failure to secure design wins could harm financial results, but Broadcom\u2019s risk is more tied to inventory and resource strain, while NVIDIA\u2019s is tied to ecosystem expansion and long-term monetization.

Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From ti me to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, i ncluding ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins.' These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess i nventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and i mplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.",

We compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools, breadth and synergy of offerings, our platform and hardware independence, our global reach, and our deep customer relationships and industry experience.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had 17,035 U.S. and other patents and 618 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.\n\nWe focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.\n\nWe and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop noninfringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.\n\nWith respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products.

The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' including the risk factor  entitled  'If  we  do  not  successfully  manage  our  strategic  alliances,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  from  such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.'\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity  in  newer  product  areas,  and  in  key  priority  and  growth  areas.  As  we  continue  to  expand  globally,  we  may  see  new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.\n\nOur  competitors  (in  each  case  relative  to  only  some  of  our  products  or  services)  include: Amazon  Web  Services  LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.; Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Ubiquiti Inc.; VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.\n\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.  As  we  expand  into  new  markets,  we  will  face  competition  not  only  from  our  existing  competitors  but  also  from  other competitors,  including  existing  companies  with  strong  technological,  marketing,  and  sales  positions  in  those  markets.  We  also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that  previously  were  segregated.  Due  to  several  factors,  including  the  availability  of  highly  scalable  and  general  purpose microprocessors,  application-specific  integrated  circuits  (ASICs)  offering  advanced  services,  standards-based  protocols,  cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\n\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with  price-performance  advantages;  the  ability  to  reduce  production  costs;  the  ability  to  provide  value-added  features  such  as security, reliability,  and  investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.\n\nWe  also  face  competition  from  customers  to  which  we  license  or  supply  technology  and  suppliers  from  which  we  transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.",

These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity  in  newer  product  areas,  and  in  key  priority  and  growth  areas.  As  we  continue  to  expand  globally,  we  may  see  new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.\n\nOur  competitors  (in  each  case  relative  to  only  some  of  our  products  or  services)  include: Amazon  Web  Services  LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.; Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Ubiquiti Inc.; VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.\n\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.  As  we  expand  into  new  markets,  we  will  face  competition  not  only  from  our  existing  competitors  but  also  from  other competitors,  including  existing  companies  with  strong  technological,  marketing,  and  sales  positions  in  those  markets.  We  also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that  previously  were  segregated.  Due  to  several  factors,  including  the  availability  of  highly  scalable  and  general  purpose microprocessors,  application-specific  integrated  circuits  (ASICs)  offering  advanced  services,  standards-based  protocols,  cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\n\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with  price-performance  advantages;  the  ability  to  reduce  production  costs;  the  ability  to  provide  value-added  features  such  as security, reliability,  and  investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.\n\nWe  also  face  competition  from  customers  to  which  we  license  or  supply  technology  and  suppliers  from  which  we  transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.",

(f/k/a Cree, Inc.), GlobalFoundries Inc., Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Heidenhain Corporation, HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd., iC-Haus GmbH, Intel Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., MaxLinear, Inc., Marvell Technology, Inc., MediaTek Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Microchip Technology Incorporated, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, OSRAM Licht AG, Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Sumitomo Corporation, Synaptics Incorporated, TDK-EPC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc. and II-VI Incorporated. We compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise, FBAR technology, amplifier design, module integration, proprietary materials processes, multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design, our broad product portfolio, support of key industry standards, reputation for quality products, and our customer relationships.\n\nIn the infrastructure software market, we compete with large enterprise software vendors who continue to expand their product and service offerings and consolidate offerings into broad product lines, and smaller, niche players focused on specific markets. Our primary competitors are Atlassian Corporation, Plc, BMC Software Inc., BeyondTrust Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk Software, Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation, Micro Focus International plc, Microsoft Corporation, New Relic, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Proofpoint, Inc., Rocket Software, Inc., SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc., ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds Corporation, Splunk, Inc. and Zscaler, Inc. We compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools, breadth and synergy of offerings, our platform and hardware independence, our global reach, and our deep customer relationships and industry experience.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had 17,035 U.S. and other patents and 618 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.\n\nWe focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.\n\nWe and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop noninfringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.\n\nWith respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow",

Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\n\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with  price-performance  advantages;  the  ability  to  reduce  production  costs;  the  ability  to  provide  value-added  features  such  as security, reliability,  and  investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.\n\nWe  also  face  competition  from  customers  to  which  we  license  or  supply  technology  and  suppliers  from  which  we  transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.",

      "answer": "Adobe's approach to unrecognized tax benefits involves recording interest and penalties in income tax expense and regularly assessing potential outcomes of tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax provision and reserves. This directly affects its financial reporting accuracy by ensuring that liabilities are recognized based on the likelihood of outcomes. Qualcomm, on the other hand, focuses on the accuracy of its tax provision by assessing potential outcomes of examinations related to special deductions, transfer pricing, and realizability of deferred tax assets. Additionally, Qualcomm reduces common stock and paid-in capital for share repurchases, which impacts retained earnings and equity presentation. Both companies' approaches influence their financial reporting accuracy and tax liability exposure in different ways: Adobe through direct income tax expense adjustments, and Qualcomm through equity and tax liability adjustments.",

To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.\n\nWe amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists. Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent.\n\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, leases and intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year.  In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for tax loss and credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\n\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our interpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations  to  determine  the  adequacy  of  our  provision  for  income  tax es  and  associated  reserves.  Our  policy  is  to  record  interest  and  penalties  related  to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\n\n## Taxes Collected from Customers\n\nWe net  taxes  collected  from  customers  against  those  remitted  to  government  authorities  in  our  financial  statements. Accordingly,  tax es  collected  from customers are not reported as revenue.\n\n## Treasury Stock\n\nPrepayments made for repurchases of our common stock are classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and only shares physically delivered to us by each period end are excluded from the computation of net income per share.\n\nWe account for treasury stock under the cost method.  When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital to the extent that there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses.  If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in capital, the losses upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Advertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $1.04 billion, $970 million and $1.04 billion, respectively.",

While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions we have taken or that we plan to take on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by taxing authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign tax es may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax  liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax  liabilities. For tax  years prior to fiscal 2021, we are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return.\n\nStock Repurchases. To reflect share repurchases in the consolidated balance sheet, we (i) reduce common stock for the par value of the shares, (ii) reduce paid-in capital for the amount in ex cess of par to zero during the quarter in which the shares are repurchased and (iii) record the residual amount, if any, to retained earnings.\n\nEarnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted-average number of dilutive common share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under our share-based compensation plans, during the reporting period, using the treasury stock method.

      "question": "What specific business model vulnerabilities are highlighted in Adobe's and Qualcomm's 2024 filings that could limit their ability to commercialize AI-related innovations, and how do these vulnerabilities directly relate to their respective revenue and growth risks as described in each filing?",
      "answer": "Adobe faces business model vulnerabilities tied to its inability to fully protect intellectual property, particularly in relation to generative AI technologies. The filing explicitly states that 'due to challenges in detecting patent infringement pertaining to generative AI technologies, it may be more difficult to protect our generative AI and related innovations with patents.' This limitation directly affects Adobe's ability to commercialize AI innovations and could lead to lost revenue from unauthorized copying or inability to assert IP rights. Additionally, Adobe notes that 'if we use generative AI in the creation of our source code, we may not be able to rely on copyright to protect such intellectual property,' further undermining its competitive differentiation and monetization potential. \n\nQualcomm, on the other hand, highlights vulnerabilities in transitioning its business model to support new product areas beyond mobile handsets, stating 'in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models or transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.' This directly affects its ability to commercialize AI-related innovations in new markets, with the filing noting that 'if we are not successful... our business and revenues may not grow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.'\n\nTogether, these vulnerabilities highlight how Adobe's IP protection challenges and Qualcomm's business model transformation risks directly constrain their ability to monetize AI innovations, with Adobe facing competitive threats from unprotected IP and Qualcomm encountering structural barriers to market expansion.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nto material cybersecurity incidents and the reasonably likely impact of such an incident on Form 8-K. Determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable may not be straightforward and any such mandatory disclosures could be costly and lead to negative publicity, loss of customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, diversion of management's attention and governmental investigations.\n\nWhile we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirements, the dynamic and evolving nature of these laws, regulations and codes, as well as their interpretation by regulators and courts, may affect our ability (and our enterprise customers' ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction and deletion of their personal information), to implement our business models effectively and to adequately address disclosure requirements. These laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (for example, AI and machine learning) and may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Perception of our practices, products, services or solutions, even if unfounded, as a violation of individual privacy, data protection rights or cybersecurity requirements, subjects us to public criticism, lawsuits, investigations, claims and other proceedings by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and reputation and expose us to increased liability, fines and other punitive measures including prohibition on sales of our products, services or solutions, restrictive judicial orders and disgorgement of data. Additionally, we collect and store information on behalf of our business customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.\n\n## Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.\n\nOur  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  copyrights  and  other  intellectual  property  are  valuable  assets  to  us.  Infringement  or  misappropriation  of  such intellectual property could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the United States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures and contractual restrictions. Despite our efforts, protecting our intellectual property rights and preventing unauthorized use of our intellectual property are inherently difficult. For instance, we actively combat software piracy, but we continue to lose revenue due to illegal use of our software. Third parties may illegally copy and sell counterfeit versions of our products. To the extent counterfeit installations and sales replace otherwise legitimate ones, our operating results could be adversely affected. We apply for patents in the United States and in foreign countries, but we are not always successful in obtaining patent protection or in obtaining such protection timely to meet our business needs. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, due to challenges in detecting patent infringement pertaining to generative AI technologies, it may be more difficult to protect our generative AI and related innovations with patents. Additionally, if we use generative AI in the creation of our source code, we may not be able to rely on copyright to protect such intellectual property. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection as U.S. laws and courts and could fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for that source code. Such loss could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying, use, or other misappropriation, our business could be harmed.\n\n## Changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. Tax  laws in the United States as well as other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business are subject to change as new laws are passed and/or new interpretations are made available, which may have a material impact on our business. These countries, governmental bodies, such as the European Commission of the European Union, and intergovernmental economic organizations, such as the Organization for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development,  have  made  or  could  make  unprecedented  assertions  about  how  taxation  is  determined  and,  in  some  cases,  have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied.\n\nChanges in our operating landscape, such as changes in laws or interpretations of tax rules, could adversely affect our effective tax rates and/or cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax  rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits. An increase in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability.",

We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from, these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns.\n\nFor example, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs. Additionally, certain customers have adopted, and other customers may adopt, policies that require us to achieve certain sustainability, climate or other environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related targets, such as our 2040 net-zero global GHG emissions commitment and our interim GHG emissions reduction goals. If we fail to achieve ESG-related targets that meet our customers' requirements or expectations, these customers may not purchase products or services from us.\n\nIf our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality or regulatory standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry) or other standards (including sustainability or other ESG-related standards) of a particular industry or application, we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited.\n\nIn addition, in order to successfully ex tend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models or transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.\n\nIf we are not successful in ex tending our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, if our new technologies and products are not successful, or if we are not successful in the time frames we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business and revenues may not grow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed.\n\n## We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\n\nWe engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business. We routinely acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies, supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and furthering our growth and diversification strategy in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not be successful, generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership or variable interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.\n\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from acquired technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may become subject to liabilities, including liabilities arising as a result of litigation, that are not covered by any indemnification protection that we may obtain. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.",

      "question": "What is the combined fair value of U.S. Agency Securities held by Apple (AAPL) and Adobe (ADBE) as reported in their respective 2024 10-K filings, and how does this allocation compare between current and non-current assets in Apple's portfolio?",
      "answer": "The combined fair value of U.S. Agency Securities held by Apple and Adobe is $5,147 million. Apple reports the fair value of its U.S. Agency Securities as $5,136 million, with $36 million classified as current and $4,829 million as non-current. Adobe reports $11 million in U.S. Agency Securities as part of its short-term investments. Therefore, Apple holds the vast majority (99.8%) of the combined U.S. Agency Securities, with nearly all of its holding classified as non-current.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AAPL's 10-K filing, extract the fair value of U.S. Agency Securities: $5,136 million, with $36 million as current and $4,829 million as non-current.",
        "Step 2: From ADBE's 10-K filing, extract the fair value of U.S. Agency Securities: $11 million, categorized under short-term investments (current).",
        "Step 3: Sum the fair values from both companies: $5,136 million (AAPL) + $11 million (ADBE) = $5,147 million total in U.S. Agency Securities.",
        "Step 4: Compare the allocation: AAPL holds 99.8% of the combined value, with 94% classified as non-current, while ADBE holds 0.2% as current."

      "question": "How does Apple's $5.159 billion investment in U.S. agency securities compare in risk profile to Adobe's investment portfolio, particularly given Adobe's disclosed exposure to market volatility and global economic conditions?",
      "answer": "Apple's investment in U.S. agency securities is quantified at $5.159 billion with a clear unrealized loss of $272 million, indicating a relatively transparent and specific risk profile for this asset class. In contrast, Adobe's 10-K highlights that its investment portfolio\u2014which includes U.S. agency securities\u2014is subject to broader market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, and global economic downturns that could lead to impairment charges. Unlike Apple\u2019s granular disclosure, Adobe emphasizes qualitative risks such as disruptions in global financial markets affecting its banking partners and customers' ability to pay, which introduces a higher degree of uncertainty in assessing the stability of Adobe\u2019s investment portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Apple's investment in U.S. agency securities is $5,159 million with an unrealized loss of $272 million, showing a specific and quantified risk profile.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Adobe discloses that its investment portfolio (which includes U.S. agency securities) is exposed to market, liquidity, credit, and interest rate risks, compounded by global economic conditions that may lead to impairment charges.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing both, Apple provides a precise risk-adjusted valuation, while Adobe highlights systemic and macroeconomic risks that affect its portfolio more broadly, introducing more uncertainty in evaluating its investment stability."

Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services and harm our business. Further, interruptions in our services caused by us or our third-party service providers may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions or contracts, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which may adversely affect our financial results. Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.\n\n## We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation, and global adverse economic conditions may harm our business and financial condition.\n\nWe derive a large portion of our total revenue from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to a number of risks, including from global adverse economic conditions, that are uncertain and beyond our control and that make forecasting operating results and decisions about future investments difficult, such as:\n\n- inflation and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation, including increasing interest rates;\n- international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad, such as uncertainty caused by economic sanctions, downturns and recessions, trade disputes, armed conflicts and wars;\n- tax laws (including U.S. tax es on foreign subsidiaries);\n- increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n- changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including antitrust and competition regulations;\n- changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;\n- inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n- costs, potential liability, delays or loss of sales resulting from trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other countries, as well as trade laws, including but not limited to economic sanctions and export controls;\n- costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages; and\n- operating in locations with a higher rate of corruption and fraudulent business practices.\n\nAdditionally, third parties we do business with and our customers have international operations and are also subject to the above risks. Adverse changes in global economic conditions have in the past resulted and may in the future result in our customers' and business partners' insolvency, inability to obtain credit to finance or purchase our products, services and solutions, or a delay in paying or an inability to pay their obligations to us. Other third parties, such as our service providers, suppliers and distributors, may be unable to deliver or be delayed in delivering critical services, products or technologies that we rely on, and our business and reputation may be harmed. Our customers' spending rate and demand for our products, services and solutions may also be adversely affected by the above risks. If our global sales are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above risks, our revenue may decline.\n\nFurther,  a  disruption  in  global  financial  markets  could  impair  our  banking  partners,  on  which  we  rely  for  operating  cash  management,  capital  market transactions and derivative programs. Such disruption could also negatively impact our customers' ability to pay us due to delays or inability to access their existing cash.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of money market funds, corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, time deposits, U.S. agency securities and asset-backed securities. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks as well as economic downturns or events that affect global or regional financial markets that may cause the value of our investments to decline, requiring impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n## Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which may increase our costs and make our sales cycles unpredictable.\n\nAs we continue to target enterprise customers for certain of our offerings, including Adobe Experience Cloud in our Digital Experience business and our Enterprise Term License Agreements in our Digital Media business, we may face increased costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing our sales.

Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services and harm our business. Further, interruptions in our services caused by us or our third-party service providers may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions or contracts, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which may adversely affect our financial results. Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.\n\n## We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation, and global adverse economic conditions may harm our business and financial condition.\n\nWe derive a large portion of our total revenue from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to a number of risks, including from global adverse economic conditions, that are uncertain and beyond our control and that make forecasting operating results and decisions about future investments difficult, such as:\n\n- inflation and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation, including increasing interest rates;\n- international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad, such as uncertainty caused by economic sanctions, downturns and recessions, trade disputes, armed conflicts and wars;\n- tax laws (including U.S. tax es on foreign subsidiaries);\n- increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n- changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including antitrust and competition regulations;\n- changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;\n- inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n- costs, potential liability, delays or loss of sales resulting from trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other countries, as well as trade laws, including but not limited to economic sanctions and export controls;\n- costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages; and\n- operating in locations with a higher rate of corruption and fraudulent business practices.\n\nAdditionally, third parties we do business with and our customers have international operations and are also subject to the above risks. Adverse changes in global economic conditions have in the past resulted and may in the future result in our customers' and business partners' insolvency, inability to obtain credit to finance or purchase our products, services and solutions, or a delay in paying or an inability to pay their obligations to us. Other third parties, such as our service providers, suppliers and distributors, may be unable to deliver or be delayed in delivering critical services, products or technologies that we rely on, and our business and reputation may be harmed. Our customers' spending rate and demand for our products, services and solutions may also be adversely affected by the above risks. If our global sales are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above risks, our revenue may decline.\n\nFurther,  a  disruption  in  global  financial  markets  could  impair  our  banking  partners,  on  which  we  rely  for  operating  cash  management,  capital  market transactions and derivative programs. Such disruption could also negatively impact our customers' ability to pay us due to delays or inability to access their existing cash.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of money market funds, corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, time deposits, U.S. agency securities and asset-backed securities. These investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks as well as economic downturns or events that affect global or regional financial markets that may cause the value of our investments to decline, requiring impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n## Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which may increase our costs and make our sales cycles unpredictable.\n\nAs we continue to target enterprise customers for certain of our offerings, including Adobe Experience Cloud in our Digital Experience business and our Enterprise Term License Agreements in our Digital Media business, we may face increased costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing our sales.

      "answer": "AMD discloses that its prepaid long-term supply agreements involve making payments to vendors, such as TSMC, to secure long-term supply capacity. This indicates a proactive financial commitment to ensure availability of critical components. In contrast, Apple does not explicitly disclose any specific financial mechanism or prepaid arrangement with TSMC; it only references TSMC as a key supplier without detailing any monetary commitments. Therefore, AMD provides a clear mechanism involving financial prepayment, while Apple's approach remains non-specific in terms of financial arrangements.",

If TSMC experiences supply constraints, both companies could face challenges: Apple may encounter difficulties in obtaining sufficient components on commercially reasonable terms, while AMD may be unable to recover prepaid amounts or secure the expected supply capacity.

          "chunk_text": "## Business Risks\n\n## To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually  introduce  new  products,  services  and  technologies,  enhance  existing  products  and  services,  effectively  stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the  availability  of  application  software  for  the  Company's  products,  the  effective  management  of  purchase  commitments  and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\n## The  Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company's supply  chain  require  considerable  time  and  resources  and  involve  significant  risks  and  uncertainties.  The  Company  has  also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  quality  or  quantity  of  products  manufactured  or  services  provided,  or  adversely  affect  the Company's  flexibility  to  respond  to  changing  conditions.  Although  arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for product  defect  expense  reimbursement,  the  Company  generally  remains  responsible  to  the  consumer  for  warranty  and  out-ofwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe  Company  relies  on  single-source  outsourcing  partners  in  the  U.S.,  Asia  and  Europe  to  supply  and  manufacture  many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure  the  supply  of  components  and  finished  goods,  if  these  outsourcing  partners  or  suppliers  experience  severe  financial problems  or  other  disruptions  in  their  business,  such  continued  supply  can  be  reduced  or  terminated,  and  the  recoverability  of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\n## Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation  within  a  particular  industry,  further  limiting  the  Company's  ability  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  of  components  on commercially  reasonable  terms  or  at  all.  The  effects  of  global  or  regional  economic  conditions  on  the  Company's  suppliers, described in ' The  Company's  operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on  global  and  regional  economic  conditions  and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, ' above, can also affect the Company's ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.",

      "question": "What does the difference in Apple and AMD's approaches to securing TSMC supply capacity through prepaid agreements suggest about their respective semiconductor supply chain strategies?",
      "answer": "Apple's strategy involves making significant, specific prepaid commitments to secure exclusive access to TSMC's advanced 5nm process technology for its custom-designed chips, indicating a focus on differentiated, high-margin products like the A15 Bionic and M1 Max. In contrast, AMD's more general reference to 'prepaid long-term supply agreements' without specifying amounts or technologies suggests a broader, capacity-focused approach to ensure stable production of its CPUs and GPUs. This implies that Apple prioritizes technological differentiation through custom silicon while AMD emphasizes securing sufficient manufacturing capacity across TSMC's various process nodes to meet volume demand for its computing and graphics products.",

      "answer": "TSMC plays a critical role in the semiconductor production strategies of both Apple and AMD by providing advanced manufacturing capabilities at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes. Apple depends on TSMC for the production of its chips, which are essential for maintaining performance and energy efficiency in its devices. AMD also relies on TSMC for the production of its wafers at 7 nm or smaller nodes, which are vital for its CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators used in machine learning and high-performance computing applications. This shared dependency on TSMC means that any disruptions in TSMC's production capacity or yield could simultaneously impact both companies' ability to develop and deliver next-generation products. Additionally, both companies may face similar supply chain risks, such as capacity constraints or technological delays, which could affect their competitive positioning and financial performance.",

Another area of focus is machine intelligence which is the platform for the growing field  of  machine  learning.  Our  CPUs,  GPUs,  accelerators,  and APUs  offer  the  computation  capability  and  flexibility required  for  various  machine  learning  deployments.  We  also  work  with  industry  leaders  on  process  technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage  research  and  development.  We  conduct  product  and  system  research  and  development  activities  for  our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams, located in Canada, China, India, Singapore and Taiwan, who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters.\n\n## Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities\n\n## Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities\n\nWe  have  foundry  arrangements  with  Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  Limited  (TSMC)  for  the production of wafers for our products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes.\n\nWe are also a party to a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF), with respect to wafer purchases at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes.\n\n## Other Third-Party Manufacturers\n\nWe outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.\n\n## Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities\n\nWafers  for  our  products  under  the  Computing  and  Graphics  and  the  Enterprise,  Embedded  and  Semi-Custom segments are delivered from third-party foundries to our assembly, test, mark and packaging partners located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two assembly, test, mark and pack (ATMP) joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs.\n\n## Intellectual Property and Licensing\n\nWe rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized thirdparty copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 25, 2021, we had approximately 4,000 patents in the United States and approximately 1,600 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 10,000 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 6,800 issued patents and 3,300 patent applications pending. We expect to  file  future  patent  applications  in  both  the  United  States  and  abroad  on  significant  inventions,  as  we  deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As  is  typical  in  the  semiconductor  industry,  we  have  numerous  cross-licensing  and  technology  exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.\n\n## Backlog\n\nSales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative  of  actual  sales  for  any  succeeding  period  as  some  of  these  orders  or  agreements  may  be  revised  or canceled  without  penalty.  With  respect  to  our  semi-custom  SoC  products,  our  orders  and  agreements  are  more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nWe focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model. Accordingly, we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. The majority of our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited ('TSMC'). We use third-party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, including TSMC, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. We use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes, such as our FBAR filters for wireless communications and our verticalcavity surface emitting laser and side emitting lasers based on GaAs and InP lasers for fiber optic communications, while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard CMOS. By doing so, we can protect our IP and accelerate time to market for our products. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the U.S. and Singapore.\n\nWe purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis. These purchases are generally on a purchase order basis and some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time and cost necessary for re-design or qualification. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of techniques, including redesigning products for alternative components, making incremental or 'lifetime' purchases, or qualifying more than one source of supply. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans, and to monitor our suppliers' financial health.\n\nWe also have a long history of operating in Asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials. We store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and our presence in Asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers' manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many i ndustries, as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, while others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors i mprove or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support.\n\nIn semiconductor solutions, we compete with integrated device manufacturers, fabless semiconductor companies and the internal resources of large i ntegrated OEMs, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Amlogic Inc., Analog Devices, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Coherent Corp., Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Heidenhain Corporation, iC-Haus GmbH, Intel Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Marvell Technology, Inc., MaxLinear, Inc., MediaTek Inc., Microchip Technology Incorporated, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., NVIDIA Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, OSRAM Licht AG, Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Sumitomo Corporation, Synaptics Incorporated, Texas Instruments, Inc., TDK-EPC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, and Wolfspeed, Inc. (f/k/a Cree, Inc.).\n\nIn infrastructure software, we compete with large enterprise software vendors who continue to expand their product and service offerings and consolidate offerings into broad product lines, and smaller, niche players focused on specific markets, such as Atlassian Corporation, Plc, BeyondTrust Corporation, BMC Software Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk Software, Ltd., Dino-Software Corporation, Fortinet, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, New Relic, Inc., OpenText Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Proofpoint, Inc., Rocket Software, Inc., SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc., ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds Corporation, Versa Networks, Inc., and Zscaler, Inc.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.",

      "answer": "AVGO implements ISO 27001 as part of its cybersecurity risk management program, which includes structured processes for identifying and mitigating risks, annual tabletop exercises, and mandatory employee training. This approach is integrated into its enterprise risk management system and overseen by experienced leadership, suggesting a proactive and formalized strategy for compliance. In contrast, CRM references ISO 27001 in the context of voluntary certifications expected by customers, and faces legal and reputational risks related to data processing, such as the ongoing Dutch Supreme Court appeal over GDPR compliance. These differences in implementation\u2014AVGO\u2019s internal governance versus CRM\u2019s customer-facing certification pressures\u2014could result in AVGO having stronger internal controls and fewer publicized compliance risks, while CRM may face greater external scrutiny and potential liabilities. This distinction in ISO 27001 application highlights varying risk profiles: AVGO\u2019s may be more operationally secure, while CRM\u2019s could be more exposed to regulatory and reputational challenges.",

CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical systems and information. Our program includes processes for identifying, assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats that are guided by the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology's Cyber Security Framework, the ISO 27001 international standard for information security and other applicable industry benchmarks.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management system and processes, and includes:\n\n- a team of professionals within our Global Technology Organization team who are responsible for identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks and managing our security controls and response activities;\n- risk assessment processes designed to identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n- an annual tabletop exercise to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident; and\n- mandatory training annually and upon hiring for all employees on data privacy and cybersecurity topics.\n\nWhen appropriate, we utilize independent, external service providers to assess, test or otherwise assist with certain aspects of our cybersecurity risk management program and related processes, including for penetration testing, threat monitoring and incident response. We also employ a vendor risk assessment process to mitigate risks presented by certain third-party service providers, and we require such providers to manage their cybersecurity risks in conformance to industry standards, notify us of relevant cybersecurity events and satisfy additional contractual requirements.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or fi nancial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, 'Cyber security threats or other security breaches, or any other impairment of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our cybersecurity-related risks.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nOur Board of Directors is actively involved in overseeing our cybersecurity risk management and shares oversight responsibility and processes with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the 'Audit Committee').\n\nOur management, including our Chief Information Officer ('CIO'), in consultation with our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), reviews with the Audit Committee at least quarterly our cybersecurity security policies, practices and protective measures, threat intelligence, cybersecurity incidents and related risks. At least quarterly, our CIO also provides the Audit Committee with an update on our enterprise security program that includes procedures and policies for testing vulnerabilities, responding to cybersecurity threats, and training and evaluating our employees. The Audit Committee and management also update our Board of Directors at least quarterly on our cybersecurity performance and risk profile and the effectiveness of our cybersecurity processes.\n\nOur management, including our CIO and CISO, are responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our CIO oversees our Global Technology Organization that has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program. Our CIO, who reports to our Chief Executive Officer, has over 20 years of experience managing global IT operations, including strategy, applications, infrastructure, information security, support and execution. Our CISO, who reports to the CIO, has approximately 30 years of cybersecurity experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs.\n\nOur management is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include, among other things, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, i ncluding external consultants engaged by us, and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment.\n\n## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nWe are headquartered in Palo Alto, California and our primary warehouse is located in Malaysia. We conduct our administration, manufacturing, research and development, sales and marketing in both owned and leased facilities. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are adequate for our present operations. We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. For example, in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch citizens that claims we violated the GDPR and Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our Audience Studio and Data Studio products. In December 2021, the Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective's claims against us inadmissible and dismissed the case, however, this ruling was appealed by the Privacy Collective. The appeal hearing took place in the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in February 2024 and the appellate court reversed the district court's judgment. We have appealed that appellate decision to the Dutch Supreme Court. We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK, which has subsequently been dismissed. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. In addition, a shift in consumers' data privacy expectations or other social, economic or political developments could impact the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and increase the cost of compliance with the imposed regulations.\n\nFurthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. In addition, new products we develop or acquire in connection with changing events may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\n\n## Industry-specific regulations and other requirements and standards are evolving and industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.\n\nOur customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing, AI services and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may ex pect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Any inability in the future to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers may harm our business and adversely affect our results.\n\nFurther, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized 'in country,' as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. This is also true with respect to the global proliferation of laws regulating the financial services industry, including its use of cloud services. In Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience Act ('DORA'), which aims to ensure the resilience of the EU financial sectors, including through mandatory risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and third-party outsourcing restrictions, went into effect in January 2025. The UK is advancing similar legislation and other countries may follow.\n\nFurther, countries and states are applying their data and consumer protection laws to AI, and particularly generative AI, and/or are enacting or considering legal frameworks on AI, such as the Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act and the draft CCPA regulations on automated decision-making technology. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.",

These risks could materially affect AVGO's business and financial condition. In contrast, CRM strategically promotes open-source software as a means to attract and enable an external developer community, supporting innovation and expanding its ecosystem.

Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.\n\n## Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nMany of our existing software customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts. These customers often do not have a contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions and often have termination for convenience clauses without payment of a substantive penalty. The failure or inability to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, or software license agreements without termination for convenience clauses could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\n\n## Our use of open source software in certain products and services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\n\nMany of our products and services incorporate open source software, the use of which may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available. Open source licenses are generally 'as-is' and do not provide warranties, support or assurance of title or controls on origin, which may expose us to potential liability if the software fails to work or has security vulnerabilities.\n\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions and security vulnerabilities, we may receive third-party claims regarding our compliance with the conditions of such open source licenses and we may be required to take steps to remedy an alleged i nfringement or noncompliance, including modifying or releasing our product code or paying damages.\n\n## Our sales to government customers subject us to uncertainties and governmental regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur contracts signed with the U.S. federal, state and local government and non-U.S. government agencies are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the government. Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely affect our sales, revenue and reputation. Additionally, our government contracts and our arrangements with channel partners who may sell directly to government customers are generally subject to requirements that may generally not be present in commercial contracts and/or may be complex, as well as audits and investigations. Failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties, and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\n\n## Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could harm our business.\n\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, customers are informed when products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. If these products or services remain subject to a service contract, the customer may transition to alternative products or services. Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n## Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this 'Risk Factors' section, these factors include, among others:\n\n- the timing of launches by our customers of new products in which our products are included and changes in end-user demand for our customers' products;\n- fl uctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers, which may lead to increased requests to delay shipment of our semiconductor products;\n- the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our semiconductor products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;\n- the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;\n- the timing of new software contracts and renewals, including the timing of software contracts that do not have termination for convenience clauses;",

With the launch of Agentforce, we've made it easier for customers to find answers by providing an even more intuitive experience on our Salesforce Help page. Agentforce can resolve customer issues swiftly and accurately because answers are grounded in our trusted unstructured content unified in Data Cloud. By automating simple and repetitive tasks, our support engineers will be able to augment and scale their time in a more valuable way.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nWe sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which comprises sales personnel based in regional hubs, field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers and selfservice offerings.\n\nTo a lesser extent, we also utilize a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and assist in selling to prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, SIs and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription services.\n\nWe use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities in the cities and countries with the largest market opportunities. Our primary marketing activities include:\n\n- multichannel marketing campaigns that span email, social media, the web, television and more, which align to a broader customer journey;\n- in-person and virtual customer events of all sizes to create customer and prospect awareness, including proprietary events such as Dreamforce and our virtual Dreamforce to You, World Tours and other virtual events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events;\n- live events and original programming on our Salesforce+ streaming service, which includes discussions about the future of technology in the AI-first, work anywhere world and educational content to learn new skills and pursue new career opportunities;\n- press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, brand, service offerings and value proposition;\n- partner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners;\n- customer testimonials and our community of Trailblazers: individuals who drive innovation, grow their careers and transform their businesses using the Salesforce Platform;\n- in-person and virtual technology event sponsorships; and\n- event partnerships with high-profile global brands and organizations.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the ex pected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally should be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms.\n\n## Human Capital Management\n\nSalesforce is committed to a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability. These core values are the foundation of our company culture, which we believe is fundamental to, and a competitive advantage in, our approach to managing our workforce. We believe our company culture fosters open dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of belonging, all of which allow us to attract and retain the best talent, which is critical for our continued success. For ex ample, our sales, engineering and customer success teams are critical to our ability to grow, innovate, and promote the trust and success of our customers.\n\nWe believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective. Our focus on our workplace environment and a strong company culture has led to recognition across the globe, as evidenced by the following awards: Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies (2024 and for the 15th time), One of America's Most JUST Companies from JUST Capital (2025 and for the eighth year in a row), Fortune World's Most Admired Companies (2025 for the 11th year in a row), Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For (2024 and for the 16th year in a row), Fortune World's Most Innovative Companies (2024, for the second year in a row), a Top 100 Employer of Choice on the American Opportunity Index (2024 and for the third year in a row), A Glassdoor Best Places to Work 2025, a 2024 Great Place to Work Best Workplace in: Japan, UK, South Korea, Argentina, France, Spain, Denmark, Canada, United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Ireland, The Netherlands, India, Portugal,",

      "question": "How do Broadcom and IBM's differing approaches to open-source software create distinct financial and operational risks for each company?",
      "answer": "Broadcom (AVGO) faces financial and operational risks related to its incorporation of open-source software, as described in its 2023 10-K filing. The company may be subject to obligations such as offering products for no cost or publicly releasing proprietary source code due to open-source licensing conditions. Additionally, the lack of warranties or support in open-source licenses exposes Broadcom to potential liabilities from software failures or security vulnerabilities. These risks could materially affect its business, financial condition, and cash flow. IBM, on the other hand, faces a different risk profile tied to its reliance on open-source software. Its offerings incorporate open-source components that are maintained by independent developer communities. If these communities stop maintaining or enhancing the code, IBM may struggle to develop new technologies or meet customer demands for innovation, quality, and price. This dependency on external open-source development creates a distinct operational risk that could hinder IBM's ability to deliver competitive products and services. Therefore, while both companies are exposed to risks from open-source software, Broadcom's risk centers on licensing and liability issues, whereas IBM's risk stems from dependency on external community-driven development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AVGO's 10-K - AVGO incorporates open-source software in its products and faces risks related to license compliance, including obligations to release proprietary code or offer products for free.",
        "Step 2: Extract from AVGO's 10-K - Open-source licenses lack warranties, support, or assurance of title, exposing AVGO to potential liabilities from security flaws or software failures.",
        "Step 3: Extract from IBM's 10-K - IBM utilizes open-source code maintained by independent communities, and if this code is no longer developed or maintained, IBM may be unable to enhance its technologies or meet customer innovation demands.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Both companies face risks tied to open-source software, but the nature of the risks differs: AVGO faces financial and compliance risks from licensing terms, while IBM faces operational risks tied to the sustainability of third-party open-source development."

      "question": "How do evolving customer requirements specifically affect the competitive positioning and gross margin risks of AVGO and IBM, given their differing market strategies?",
      "answer": "Evolving customer requirements pose distinct risks to both AVGO and IBM, impacting their competitive positioning and financial performance. For AVGO, the document states that changes in customer requirements are a key competitive factor that could prevent the company from growing its revenue. AVGO operates in industries characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving standards, and shifts in customer needs, all of which require timely development and introduction of new products. Failure to meet these evolving needs could result in lost market share or reduced gross margins. Additionally, AVGO\u2019s gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, and a shift away from higher-margin products due to changing customer preferences could further erode profitability. For IBM, the challenge lies in its strategic investments in growth areas such as hybrid cloud and AI, where client adoption rates and economic models are uncertain. If IBM fails to anticipate and respond to evolving customer and market preferences, demand for its products and services may decline, or its costs may increase. Furthermore, IBM\u2019s offerings that incorporate open-source software may struggle to meet customer innovation, quality, and pricing expectations if the open-source community no longer supports the code. While both companies face risks from evolving customer requirements, AVGO\u2019s exposure is more directly tied to product competitiveness and margin sustainability, whereas IBM\u2019s risk centers on its ability to adapt its strategic offerings and cost structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AVGO's 10-K - 'changes in customer requirements' are listed as a competitive factor that could prevent revenue growth and lead to margin erosion.",
        "Step 2: Extract from AVGO's 10-K - gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, and a shift away from higher-margin products could adversely affect future gross margin percentages.",
        "Step 3: Extract from IBM's 10-K - failure to anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences could lead to declining demand or increased costs.",
        "Step 4: Extract from IBM's 10-K - offerings incorporating open-source software may struggle to meet customer requirements if the relevant community no longer maintains the code.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Both companies face risks from evolving customer requirements, but the nature of those risks differs: AVGO is more exposed to competitive product shifts and margin pressure, while IBM faces uncertainty in strategic growth areas and potential limitations in open-source dependencies."

      "answer": "Intel's reliance on third-party foundries like TSMC puts it at a disadvantage compared to Apple, which designs its own ARM-based semiconductors and integrates them vertically with its software and hardware. Apple's strategy has allowed it to develop a competitive ecosystem that threatens Intel's market position, particularly in PCs and servers. Intel notes in its 2023 10-K that Apple's introduction of internally developed ARM-based chips in 2020 led to increased competition and ecosystem growth around ARM, which has weakened Intel's competitive standing. This shift has contributed to a decline in Intel's revenue and market share, particularly in the data center and client platform segments, as customers have moved toward alternatives like GPUs and ARM-based processors.",

      "question": "How does Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy, which includes building foundry capacity to compete with TSMC, potentially affect Apple's reliance on TSMC for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, especially considering TSMC's 59% market share and Apple's strategic use of TSMC's leading-edge nodes like 3nm and 5nm for its custom chips?",
      "answer": "Intel\u2019s IDM 2.0 strategy involves significant capital investments to build leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing capacity and establish IFS as a major foundry services provider. This strategy aims to compete directly with TSMC, which holds 59% of the global foundry market share. Apple, as a major consumer of advanced semiconductor technology, relies on TSMC for the production of its custom chips using leading-edge nodes such as 3nm and 5nm. If Intel successfully executes its IDM 2.0 strategy and offers competitive alternatives to TSMC\u2019s services, it could potentially diversify Apple\u2019s supplier base and reduce its dependency on TSMC. However, since TSMC currently leads in market share and advanced node availability, especially outside of Asia, Apple is likely to remain heavily reliant on TSMC in the near term unless Intel\u2019s offerings become technically and geographically competitive.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source B (INTC 10-K) - Intel is pursuing an IDM 2.0 strategy that includes building leading-edge foundry capacity and establishing IFS as a major provider of semiconductor manufacturing solutions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (INTC 10-K) - TSMC leads the foundry market with 59% share and currently does not offer its most advanced nodes outside of Asia, with limited U.S. capacity.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source A (AAPL 10-K) - Apple partners with TSMC and relies on its advanced process technologies, including 3nm and 5nm nodes, for the design and manufacture of custom chips used in its devices.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Intel\u2019s foundry ambitions could offer Apple an alternative supplier if Intel\u2019s advanced packaging and process technologies become competitive. However, TSMC\u2019s current dominance and geographic limitations mean Apple will likely remain dependent on TSMC unless Intel\u2019s strategy delivers viable alternatives."

      "answer": "Both NVDA and ORCL have disclosed that they have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in their technology-related agreements with third parties, but neither company has recorded any material liability for such obligations. NVDA states that maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. Similarly, ORCL notes that it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to its limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Therefore, the combined maximum potential financial exposure from these indemnifications remains unquantified and no liability has been recorded by either company.",

      "answer": "Juniper Networks, Inc. is listed as a direct competitor to both Cisco and NVIDIA in their respective 10-K filings, indicating that both companies face competitive pressure in overlapping market segments such as networking infrastructure. Cisco highlights that competition in the networking and communications equipment market is intense, with Juniper Networks, Inc. being one of several competitors that challenge Cisco\u2019s market position. Cisco emphasizes that its ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services is a key competitive factor. In contrast, NVIDIA\u2019s competitive strategy relies heavily on proprietary IP, patents, and strategic acquisitions to maintain its edge in accelerated computing. However, NVIDIA notes that Juniper Networks, Inc. is among the companies supplying interconnect, switch, and cable solutions, which are critical components in high-performance computing and data center infrastructure. This shared competitive threat implies that Juniper\u2019s advancements in these areas could undermine both Cisco\u2019s product breadth advantage and NVIDIA\u2019s reliance on proprietary acceleration technologies. Furthermore, NVIDIA\u2019s failed $1.36 billion acquisition of Arm due to regulatory challenges highlights the risks associated with strategic moves to strengthen competitive positioning, which could indirectly benefit competitors like Juniper Networks, Inc.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Cisco lists Juniper Networks, Inc. as a key competitor and emphasizes the importance of providing a broad range of networking and communications products and services as a competitive factor.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NVIDIA lists Juniper Networks, Inc. as a competitor in the interconnect, switch, and cable solutions market and highlights its reliance on proprietary IP and patents, as well as the $1.36 billion charge from the failed Arm acquisition.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Cisco and NVIDIA face competitive pressure from Juniper Networks, Inc., but their strategic responses differ: Cisco focuses on product breadth, while NVIDIA emphasizes IP and acquisitions. The failure of NVIDIA\u2019s acquisition could indirectly benefit Juniper, impacting both companies\u2019 market positions."

Risk Factors,' including the risk factor  entitled  'If  we  do  not  successfully  manage  our  strategic  alliances,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  from  such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.'\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity  in  newer  product  areas,  and  in  key  priority  and  growth  areas.  As  we  continue  to  expand  globally,  we  may  see  new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.\n\nOur  competitors  (in  each  case  relative  to  only  some  of  our  products  or  services)  include: Amazon  Web  Services  LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.; Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Ubiquiti Inc.; VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.\n\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.  As  we  expand  into  new  markets,  we  will  face  competition  not  only  from  our  existing  competitors  but  also  from  other competitors,  including  existing  companies  with  strong  technological,  marketing,  and  sales  positions  in  those  markets.  We  also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that  previously  were  segregated.  Due  to  several  factors,  including  the  availability  of  highly  scalable  and  general  purpose microprocessors,  application-specific  integrated  circuits  (ASICs)  offering  advanced  services,  standards-based  protocols,  cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\n\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with  price-performance  advantages;  the  ability  to  reduce  production  costs;  the  ability  to  provide  value-added  features  such  as security, reliability,  and  investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.\n\nWe  also  face  competition  from  customers  to  which  we  license  or  supply  technology  and  suppliers  from  which  we  transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.",

Since  our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled  by  the  sustained  demand  for  exceptional  3D  graphics  and  the  scale  of  the  gaming  market,  NVIDIA  has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.\n\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it  also  simulates  human  intelligence,  enabling  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  physical  world.  Its  parallel  processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding.\n\nNVIDIA  has  a  platform  strategy,  bringing  together  hardware  and  systems,  software,  algorithms  and  libraries,  and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse,  we  address  them  with  a  unified  underlying  architecture  leveraging  our  GPUs  and  software  stacks.  The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\n\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $29 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions  that  are  essential  to  modern  computing.  Our  invention  of  the  GPU  in  1999  defined  modern  computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model  in  2006,  we  opened  the  parallel  processing  capabilities  of  our  GPU  for  general  purpose  computing.  This approach  significantly  accelerates  the  most  demanding  high-performance  computing,  or  HPC,  applications  in  fields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs and networking accelerate many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the pace described by Moore's Law, we deliver GPU performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore's Law, giving the industry a path forward.\n\nGamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the world's  fastest  growing  spectator  sport,  eSports,  which  attracts  hundreds  of  millions  of  viewers  to  watch  top-quality gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding as a result of the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators.\n\nResearchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to climate forecasting. With support for more than 2,500 applications - including the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from climate prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers over 70%, and 8 of the top 10, supercomputers on the global TOP500 list.\n\nThe world's leading cloud service providers and consumer internet companies use our GPUs to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end-users, including search, recommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, translation, AI assistants, navigation, and cloud computing.\n\nA rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our GPUs and AI software to bring automation to the products and services they build. The transportation industry is turning to our platforms for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry is leveraging them for enhanced medical imaging and accelerated drug discovery; and the financial services industry is using them for fraud detection.\n\nProfessional  designers  use  our  GPUs  and  software  to  create  visual  effects  in  movies,  and  design  buildings  and products ranging from cell phones to commercial aircraft.",

The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.",

We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers  and  licensors  designing  discrete  and  integrated  GPUs,  custom  chips  and  other  accelerated computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\n- suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc.,  AMD,  Broadcom  Inc., Intel, Qualcomm  Incorporated, Renesas  Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\n- suppliers  of  interconnect,  switch  and  cable  solutions  such  as  AMD,  Applied  Optoelectronics,  Inc.,  Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe  rely  primarily  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  employee  and  third-party  nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;\n- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n- the  commercial  significance  of  our  operations  and  our  competitors'  operations  in  particular  countries  and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods.

      "question": "Given AMD's reliance on ODMs for motherboard design and manufacturing in its chipset business and IBM's competition with original device manufacturer (ODM) systems that are often re-branded, how do these two companies' relationships with ODMs differ in terms of strategic positioning and risk exposure?",
      "answer": "AMD strategically partners with ODMs to design and manufacture motherboards that incorporate its chipsets, which are then used by PC OEMs. This close collaboration helps AMD align product development with customer needs and improves time-to-market for its clients. In contrast, IBM competes with ODM systems that are often re-branded, positioning itself as a differentiated provider of hybrid cloud infrastructure solutions. This means IBM views some ODM-based offerings as competitive threats rather than partners. As a result, AMD benefits from ODMs as enablers of its product integration, while IBM faces market pressure from ODM-based systems that challenge its infrastructure offerings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AMD's 10-K, ODMs are integral to the chipset business, as they design and manufacture motherboards incorporating AMD's chipsets for OEMs.",
        "Step 2: AMD's collaboration with ODMs includes design support and engineering services, which enhances customer time-to-market and product differentiation.",
        "Step 3: IBM's 10-K states that it competes with original device manufacturer systems that are often re-branded, indicating that ODM-based systems are seen as market threats in the infrastructure segment.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the two perspectives: AMD leverages ODMs as partners to extend its reach and integration, while IBM must differentiate itself against ODM-based offerings in the infrastructure market."

          "chunk_text": "## Customers\n\nOur  microprocessor  customers  consist  primarily  of  original  equipment  manufacturers  (OEMs),  large  public  cloud service  providers,  original  design  manufacturers  (ODMs),  system  integrators  and  independent  distributors  in  both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).\n\nCustomers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers' needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers' time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.\n\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\n\nTwo customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe  focus  on  three  types  of  OEM  partners:  multi-nationals,  selected  regional  accounts  and  some  local  system integrators,  who  target  commercial  and  consumer  end  customers  of  all  sizes.  Large  multi-nationals  and  regional accounts  are  the  core  of  our  OEM  partners'  business;  however,  we  are  increasingly  focused  on  the  Value  Added Reseller  (VAR)  channel  which  resells  OEM  systems  to  the  mid-market  and  the  small  and  medium  business  (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with  their  software  and  services  solutions  into  Enterprise,  HPC  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  Customers.  Our  OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors  handle  a  wide  variety  of  products,  and  may  include  those  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our  agreements  with  distributors  protect  their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements  with  our  distributors  may  contain  standard  stock  rotation  provisions  permitting  limited  levels  of  product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.",

      "question": "How does AMD's dependency on Microsoft's operating system development, combined with IBM's competitive positioning in hybrid cloud infrastructure against Microsoft, influence the broader x86-based innovation landscape and competitive dynamics in the technology sector?",
      "answer": "AMD's ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel is partially dependent on Microsoft designing its operating systems to support AMD's x86-based microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to develop operating systems that work with AMD's x86 instruction sets, independent software providers may not design software to take advantage of AMD's innovations, potentially reducing market adoption of AMD-based systems. Meanwhile, IBM competes with Microsoft in the hybrid cloud infrastructure market, offering on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions tailored for mission-critical and regulated workloads. IBM differentiates itself through investments in security, scalability, and reliability, which could influence enterprise clients' preferences in infrastructure decisions. This dynamic creates a multi-layered impact: Microsoft's support (or lack thereof) for AMD's x86-based innovations affects software compatibility and system adoption, while its competition with IBM in cloud infrastructure influences broader platform choices in enterprise environments, thereby shaping the ecosystem in which x86-based technologies evolve.",

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs.

Another area of focus is machine intelligence which is the platform for the growing field  of  machine  learning.  Our  CPUs,  GPUs,  accelerators,  and APUs  offer  the  computation  capability  and  flexibility required  for  various  machine  learning  deployments.  We  also  work  with  industry  leaders  on  process  technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage  research  and  development.  We  conduct  product  and  system  research  and  development  activities  for  our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams, located in Canada, China, India, Singapore and Taiwan, who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters.\n\n## Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities\n\n## Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities\n\nWe  have  foundry  arrangements  with  Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  Limited  (TSMC)  for  the production of wafers for our products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes.\n\nWe are also a party to a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc.

We are party to two assembly, test, mark and pack (ATMP) joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs.\n\n## Intellectual Property and Licensing\n\nWe rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized thirdparty copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 25, 2021, we had approximately 4,000 patents in the United States and approximately 1,600 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 10,000 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 6,800 issued patents and 3,300 patent applications pending. We expect to  file  future  patent  applications  in  both  the  United  States  and  abroad  on  significant  inventions,  as  we  deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As  is  typical  in  the  semiconductor  industry,  we  have  numerous  cross-licensing  and  technology  exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.\n\n## Backlog\n\nSales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative  of  actual  sales  for  any  succeeding  period  as  some  of  these  orders  or  agreements  may  be  revised  or canceled  without  penalty.  With  respect  to  our  semi-custom  SoC  products,  our  orders  and  agreements  are  more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally.

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results.

      "answer": "AMD's product quality issues could arise from its reliance on third-party manufacturers like GF and ATMP JVs, where a lack of guaranteed capacity, potential delays, or poor yields could lead to supply disruptions and lost sales. Specifically, if GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation, AMD could face significant delays in product shipments. Additionally, AMD's dependency on third-party suppliers for critical manufacturing steps could result in quality issues that adversely impact its ability to meet customer demand and maintain gross margins. IBM, on the other hand, faces risks related to product quality stemming from its reliance on a global supply chain for hardware and software components, including single or limited suppliers for critical technologies like server processors. Defective components or inadequate services from suppliers could reduce the reliability of IBM's products and services, harming its reputation and operating results. Thus, while both companies face product quality risks, AMD's issues are more tied to manufacturing capacity and supply chain execution, whereas IBM's are linked to the integrity and reliability of components sourced from a complex supplier ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use or the value of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe Company's Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely or secure manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation.\n\nProduct and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company's operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results.\n\nThe Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations, financial results and reputation.\n\nThe Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers, independent software vendors, independent service providers, and other ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated ecosystem growth objectives. In addition, the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market.",

We seek to protect our R&amp;D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&amp;D initiatives by, from time-to-time, acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&amp;D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.\n\n## Areas Key to Product Competitiveness\n\nWe have intensified our focus and investment on areas key to product competitiveness. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.\n\nxPU. We believe the future is with xPU across a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, NPU, IPU, accelerators, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing:\n\n- Client CPUs. In 2024, we ramped sales of the Intel Core\u2122 Ultra Series 1, our first product with an integrated neural processing unit for efficient processing of AI workload. The Intel Core Ultra Series 1, manufactured on the Intel 4 process, introduced the first A I PCs to the market. We also launched the Intel Core Ultra 200V  Series, showcasing power efficiency and long-lasting battery life. The 200V  Series, manufactured by an external foundry, leverages our Xe2 GPU architecture, bringing improved efficiency, second-generation ray tracing units and X M X  A I acceleration to thin and light notebooks. During 2024, a significant majority of our client sales consisted of our 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core processors, manufactured on Intel 7, which allow us to serve the breadth of customer and computing needs in the client market. \u00ae\n- Data center CPUs. We launched our Intel Xeon  6 processors for the data center, utilizing the Intel 3 process, including our first Intel X eon processor using Efficient cores (E-cores). The Intel X eon 6 family is designed to address the growing diversity in workloads and deployments in the data center environments. Our 5th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processors, based on Intel 7, were launched in 2023, and continued to ramp throughout 2024. \u00ae \u00ae\n- Discrete client GPUs. The Intel Arc\u2122 graphics family offers modern GPU features to power immersive games, creator applications, and A I workloads. In 2024, we launched the Intel A rc B-Series based on the latest X e2 GPU architecture. The compute engine of the Intel A rc B-Series is our secondgeneration X -core, which delivers 70% more performance per core and is 50% more power efficient than the Intel A rc A 750. \u00ae e\n- Edge computing. We recently launched a suite of processors for edge computing. This includes the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series, bringing the NPU IP to desktops and reducing package power. These hybrid designs utilize our most advanced performance cores and power-efficient cores, as well as the latest packaging technology.\n- Datacenter AI accelerators and GPUs. In 2024, we launched the Intel Gaudi 3 A I accelerators offering significant price-performance advantages for A I inference applications. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nSoftware. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures.\n\nWe aim to optimize AI frameworks and middleware, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, vLLM , Hugging Face and WebNN to run efficiently on our hardware. Our OpenVINO\u2122 toolkit is an open source toolkit that accelerates deep learning inference on our processors across various use cases, such as generative A I, computer vision, audio, and language with industry standard models. It is used in domains from edge to A I PC to cloud and is the leading inferencing library on our silicon.\n\nIn 2024 we launched the Open Platform for Enterprise A I under the Linux Foundation to accelerate deployment of generative A I use cases through industry standard modular microservice architecture. Since launch, the ecosystem has been actively engaged, with an expanding network of partners enhancing features and developing new capabilities.\n\nMost of these frameworks and middleware are built from our oneAPI, which enables developers to create performant cross-architecture applications using a single code base across CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators. We contributed our oneAPI specifications and implementations to the UXL Foundation under the Linux Foundation. By doing so, oneAPI delivers an open and multi-vendor programming model enabling choice and code re-use across the accelerator hardware ecosystem.\n\nThis software stack is designed to preserve the usability of existing tools and software while accommodating future developments, enabling continuity for users and developers.\n\n## Areas Key to Process and Packaging Competitiveness\n\nOur leading-edge process and packaging technology continues to be key to the success of our strategy.\n\n- Intel 7 process node continues in production for our 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core processors. Intel 7 was utilized for a significant majority of our processor production and products in 2024, and is expected to continue to be utilized for a significant portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n\nOur Capital\n\n7",

Our i nfrastructure technologies are designed to be flexible, cost-effective, standards-based, secure and highly-performant to facilitate the development, deployment, i ntegration, management and extension across an organization's cloud-based, on-premise and hybrid IT environments.\n\nOur cloud and license business' infrastructure technologies include the Oracle Database and MySQL Database, the world's most popular database management systems; Java, the computer industry's most widely-used language by professional software developers; and middleware, including development tools, among others. These infrastructure technologies are available through a subscription to our OCI offerings or through the purchase of a license and related license support, at the customer's option, to run within the Oracle Cloud as a part of a customer's cloud based, on-premise or other IT environments. Our OCI offerings also include cloud-based compute, storage and networking capabilities, application development and cloud native services, among others, and new and i nnovative services such as AI Infrastructure offerings and emerging technologies such as generative AI, IoT and blockchain.\n\nOur hardware business' infrastructure technologies consist of hardware products and certain unique hardware-related software offerings, including Oracle Engineered Systems, enterprise servers, storage solutions, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, management software and related hardware support services. Our customers use Oracle hardware products and related offerings in their cloud-based, on-premise or hybrid environments to run their internal business operations and to deliver products and services to their customers.\n\nWe design our infrastructure technologies to work in our customers' on-premise IT environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. Our flexible and open approach also provides Oracle customers with a choice as to how they can utilize and deploy Oracle infrastructure technologies: through the use of Oracle Cloud offerings; on-premise in our customers' data centers; or a hybrid combination of these two deployment models, such as in the Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer deployment models (described further below). We focus on the operation and integration of Oracle i nfrastructure technologies to make them easier to deploy, extend, interconnect, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve computing performance relative to our competitors' offerings. For example, the Oracle Exadata Database Machine integrates multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance, availability, scalability, security and operational efficiency of Oracle Database workloads relative to our competitors' products.\n\n## Oracle Infrastructure Technologies - Cloud and License Business Offerings\n\nOracle infrastructure technologies are marketed, sold and delivered through our cloud and license business. Our infrastructure cloud services and license support revenues represented 54%, 53% and 58% of our total cloud services and license support revenues during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)\n\nOCI offerings are based upon Oracle's Next-Generation Cloud Infrastructure and are designed to deliver our infrastructure technologies, including compute, storage and networking services, as a service. OCI offerings include our Oracle Autonomous Database offerings, among others, that Oracle runs, manages, upgrades and supports on behalf of the customer. We typically charge a prepaid fee that is decremented as the OCI services are consumed by the customer over a stated time period. By utilizing OCI, customers can leverage the Oracle Cloud for enterprise-grade, high performance, scalable, cost-effective and secure i nfrastructure technologies that are designed to be rapidly deployable and provide real-time elasticity while reducing the amount of time and resources normally consumed by IT processes within on-premise environments. OCI is designed to be differentiated from other cloud vendors to provide better security by separating cloud control code computers from customer compute nodes. Customers use OCI to build and operate new applications ranging from low-code to AI powered cloud-native",

Our customers primarily include OEM s, ODM s, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM  channels throughout the world. We market and sell these products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We manufacture our products at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities located throughout the world. We seek to expand our Intel Foundry business as a third-party foundry for external customers.\n\n## A Year in Rev iew\n\n2024 revenue was $53.1 billion, down $1.1 billion, or 2%, from 2023 due to lower all other revenue and lower Intel Foundry revenue, partially offset by higher Intel Products revenue. All other revenue decreased 32% from 2023, driven by lower A ltera revenue due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and lower M obileye revenue as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories of EyeQ products. Intel Foundry external revenue decreased 60% from 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales. Intel Products revenue increased 3% from 2023 due primarily to higher CCG and DCAI revenue. CCG revenue increased 4% from 2023 primarily due to higher notebook volume compared to 2023 and was partially  offset by  lower other CCG rev enue, which decreased from 2023 due to the exit of legacy businesses, and lower desktop revenue, which decreased on lower demand compared to 2023. DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2024 were meaningfully impacted by non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, restructuring charges resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan, non-cash impairments of goodwill and certain other assets, as well as non-cash charges related to a valuation allowance recognized against our US deferred tax assets. In 2024, we invested $16.5 billion in R&amp;D, made gross capital investments of $25.1 billion, and had $8.3 billion in cash from operations and negative $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow . 1\n\nOur 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. In 2024, our previously announced internal foundry operating model took effect, creating a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and the Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry M anufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of our internal foundry operating model, we began separately reporting the financials for our Intel Products and Intel Foundry businesses in Q1 2024 and, in Q3 2024, we announced our intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We also made meaningful progress on our previously announced plan to operate Altera  as a standalone business beginning in Q1 2024, readying the business and paving the way for value capture opportunities in early 2025. \u00ae\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn 2024, we announced our intention to implement a series of cost and capital reduction initiatives designed to adjust our spending to current business trends while enabling our new operating model and continuing to fund investments in our core strategy-returning to product and process competitiveness. These initiativ es, which we refer to as our 2024 Restructuring Plan, include reducing headcount, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio rev iews of our businesses under a \"clean sheet\" view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. The headcount actions in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in an approximate 15% decrease in our core Intel workforce by early 2025. A s a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in 2024.\n\nOur 2024 consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:\n\n- \u25a0 $3.3 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;\n- \u25a0 $3.1 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and\n- \u25a0 $9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Segments and Prior Year Results\n\nDuring 2024, we managed our business through the operating segments that are presented below and have included the 2024, 2023, and 2022 segment financial results and related discussions of our segments' results of operations. Our segments' results of operations presented below exclude the $7.0 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our CODM s receive, view, and use information for decision-making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.\n\nMD&amp;A\n\n13",

      "question": "How do Intel's and Oracle's 2024 Restructuring Plans differ in their approaches to cost-saving initiatives, particularly regarding Intel's $14.0 billion capital expenditure commitment for 2025?",
      "answer": "Intel's 2024 Restructuring Plan focuses on reducing operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales through measures such as headcount reductions, aiming to create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing competitiveness. This includes a $14.0 billion capital expenditure commitment for 2025, primarily directed toward expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, as well as investing in a new leading-edge facility in Ohio. In contrast, Oracle's 2024 Restructuring Plan centers on improving operational efficiency in support of its cloud-based offerings, with cost savings being partially offset by targeted investments in cloud infrastructure and delivery capabilities, such as its second-generation cloud infrastructure. While Intel's restructuring involves significant physical capital investment, Oracle's approach emphasizes strategic reallocation of resources toward digital infrastructure, reflecting divergent strategic priorities in their respective sectors.",

          "chunk_text": "## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the table below, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken, including our Ireland SCIP transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2024 that resulted in $11.0 billion of net cash inflows to us (see \"Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; investments in our product roadmap; working capital requirements, including cash outlays associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan; partner distributions to our non-controlling interest holders; and strategic investments. We expect reductions in operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales after implementing our 2024 Restructuring Plan and related cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount, which are designed to enable further operational efficiency and agility and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing competitiveness. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, New M exico, and Oregon, and investing in a new leading-edge manufacturing facility in Ohio. They may also include longer-term projects, certain of which we have currently put on hold or slowed the completion of, including a new leading-edge manufacturing facility, a new assembly and test facility, and a new advanced packaging facility, among others.\n\nWe entered into government incentive arrangements with the US federal government pursuant to the CHIPS Act. In September 2024, we were awarded up to $3.0 billion in direct funding for the Secure Enclave program to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives pursuant to the CHIPS Act, and we received $1.1 billion of cash in 2024 and have received an additional $1.1 billion of cash in 2025. We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives, though recent US government actions create uncertainty as to the receipt of awards under our existing CHIPS A ct agreements and the potential for future awards in the US. These incentives typically require that we make significant capital investments in new facilities or expand existing facilities and our related workforce. To the extent we delay or cancel any such projects or otherwise are unable or fail to comply with the terms of the agreements, there may be a delay in our receipt of, or we may forfeit or be required to repay, the associated government incentives.\n\nWe expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. A s of December 28, 2024, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $14.0 billion for 2025 and had $6.0 billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term. A s of December 28, 2024, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2025 under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $2.1 billion, with an additional $4.9 billion committed in the long term.\n\nWe have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see: \"Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our SCIP arrangements and variable distribution payments that we expect to make to our co-investment partners, including liquidated damage provisions should we fail to meet certain construction milestones or operational metrics; \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply agreements structured as leases; \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our tax obligations, including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings; and \"Note 13: Borrowings\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by v endors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.\n\nWhen assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total cash and short-term investments as follows:\n\n",

In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous  driving  -  such  as  perception,  localization,  and  planning  -  are  too  complex  for  legacy  hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally safe AIbased hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment,  as  well  as  to  re-simulate  their  operation  prior  to  any  over-the-air  software  updates.  We  believe  our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\n\nLeveraging  our  intellectual  property,  or  IP. We believe  our  IP  is  a  valuable  asset  that  can  be  accessed  by  our customers  and  partners  through  license  and  development  agreements  when  they  desire  to  build  such  capabilities directly  into  their  own  products,  or  have  us  do  so  through  a  custom  development.  Such  license  and  development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nOur  worldwide  sales  and  marketing  strategy  is  key  to  achieving  our  objective  of  providing  markets  with  our  highperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network.

      "answer": "Adobe utilizes its ISV relationships as part of its distribution network to deliver products and services to end users, enabling broader market reach beyond direct sales and app stores. This distribution strategy allows Adobe to integrate its software into various third-party solutions and ensures availability across multiple channels. NVIDIA, on the other hand, engages with ISVs as part of its broader ecosystem approach to platform adoption, particularly for its GPU technologies. By working closely with ISVs, NVIDIA ensures that its platforms are supported by a wide range of software applications, enhancing the value and utility of its hardware for developers and end users. Both companies thus rely on ISVs to extend their market influence, though Adobe focuses on distribution efficiency while NVIDIA emphasizes platform integration and developer enablement.",

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Operations\n\nFounded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified  software  companies  in  the  world. We  offer  a  line  of products and services used by creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats.\n\nWe market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service ('SaaS') model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors,  value-added  resellers  ('V ARs'),  systems  integrators  ('SIs'),  independent  software  vendors  ('ISVs'),  retailers, software  developers  and  original  equipment  manufacturers  ('OEMs').  In  addition,  we  license  our  technology  to  hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ('EMEA'); and Asia-Pacific ('APAC').\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP') and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC').\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stockbased  compensation,  determining  the  fair  value  of  acquired  assets  and  assumed  liabilities,  litigation  and  income  taxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\n## Fiscal Year\n\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans,  consulting  services,  training  and  technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\n\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or  services  to  customers  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  in  exchange  for  those  products  or services.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nWe may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.\n\nWe enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting  arrangements.  We  also  enter  into  collateral  security  agreements  with  certain  of  our  counterparties  to  exchange  cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted  is  included  in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  and  collateral  received  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  on  our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nIn  countries  outside  the  United  States,  we  transact  business  in  U.S.  Dollars  and  in  various  other  currencies. We  may  use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These  foreign  exchange  contracts,  carried  at  fair  value,  have  maturities  of  up  to  twelve  months. As  of  December  3,  2021  and November 27, 2020, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $2.06 billion and $1.53 billion, respectively, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars.\n\nIn  June  2019,  we  entered  into  Treasury  lock  agreements  with  large  financial  institutions  which  fixed  benchmark  U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedged the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and were settled upon debt issuance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We incurred a loss related to the settlement of the instruments which is amortized to interest expense over the term of our debt due February 1, 2030. See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.\n\nAs of December 3, 2021, we had net derivative gains on our foreign exchange option contracts expected to be recognized within the next 18 months, of which $56 million of gains are expected to be recognized into revenue within the next 12 months. In addition,  we  had  net  derivative  losses  on  our Treasury  lock  agreements,  of  which  $4  million  is  expected  to  be  recognized  into interest expense within the next 12 months.\n\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency and Treasury lock cash flow hedges to revenue and interest expense, respectively. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge  from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  to  the  same  income  statement  line  item  as  the  hedged  item.  We evaluate  hedge  effectiveness  at  the  inception  of  the  hedge  prospectively,  and  on  an  ongoing  basis  both  retrospectively  and prospectively. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.\n\nEffective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, all changes in fair value of our foreign currency cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Prior to this, we recorded the time value of purchased contracts in other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The impact of the de-designation of our hedges due to the change in methodology in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was not material.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no net gains or losses recognized in income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\n\n## Non-Designated Hedges\n\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

          "chunk_text": "position.  Our AI  technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are almost 3 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and almost 10,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the  latest  techniques  on  how  to  design,  train,  and  deploy  neural  networks  in  applications  using  our  accelerated computing platform.\n\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics is fundamental  to  the  continued  expansion  and  evolution  of  computing.  We  apply  our  research  and  development resources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications, and create new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our computer graphics platforms  leverage  not  only  our  industry-leading  GeForce  and  NVIDIA  RTX  GPUs,  but  also optimized software stacks. For example, GeForce Experience enhances each gamer's experience by optimizing their PC's settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, designers and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed  by  almost  any  device,  almost  anywhere,  through  our  cloud  platforms  such  as  vGPU  for  enterprise  and GeForce NOW for gaming.\n\nAdvancing  the  leading  autonomous  vehicle  platform. We  believe  the  advent  of  AV  will  soon  revolutionize  the transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous  driving  -  such  as  perception,  localization,  and  planning  -  are  too  complex  for  legacy  hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally safe AIbased hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment,  as  well  as  to  re-simulate  their  operation  prior  to  any  over-the-air  software  updates.  We  believe  our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\n\nLeveraging  our  intellectual  property,  or  IP. We believe  our  IP  is  a  valuable  asset  that  can  be  accessed  by  our customers  and  partners  through  license  and  development  agreements  when  they  desire  to  build  such  capabilities directly  into  their  own  products,  or  have  us  do  so  through  a  custom  development.  Such  license  and  development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nOur  worldwide  sales  and  marketing  strategy  is  key  to  achieving  our  objective  of  providing  markets  with  our  highperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, addin  board  manufacturers,  or  AIBs,  retailers/distributors,  ISVs,  internet  and  cloud  service  providers,  automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.\n\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers and solution architects to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network's time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.\n\nTo  encourage  the  development  of  applications  optimized  for  our  platforms  and  software,  we  seek  to  establish  and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with  key  software  developers  to  promote  and  discuss  our  platforms,  as  well  as  to  ascertain  individual  product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game titles  that  are  optimized  for  our  platforms.  Our  Deep  Learning  Institute  provides  in-person  and  online  training  for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.",

      "answer": "IBM adjusts its allowance for credit losses, which directly affects its consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made, particularly when dealing with major customers or unexpected default rates. In contrast, NVIDIA recognizes allowances for credit losses and write-downs in the 'other income (expense), net' section of its Consolidated Statements of Income, which also impacts its net income but is tied to the valuation of marketable securities and accounts receivable. Therefore, while both companies account for credit losses, IBM's adjustments are tied to customer-specific creditworthiness and broader receivables performance, whereas NVIDIA's are more closely linked to financial instruments and customer receivables evaluated under its investment policy.",

      "answer": "The Infrastructure segment from IBM lists Intel as one of its principal competitors, alongside Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), NetApp, and Pure Storage. Meanwhile, NVDA\u2019s 10-K filing identifies Intel as one of its competitors in the accelerated computing processors market, which includes GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, and other AI computing products. Intel's presence in both competitor lists demonstrates its competitive positioning across two distinct but related markets: hybrid cloud infrastructure (where it competes with IBM) and accelerated computing (where it competes with NVDA). This dual presence suggests that Intel operates across multiple layers of the computing ecosystem\u2014both in foundational infrastructure hardware and in specialized AI/compute processors\u2014positioning it as a broad-based competitor in the broader IT and AI technology landscape.",

This increases compliance costs and could reduce revenue if product changes are required. Cisco, in turn, highlights that changes in telecommunications regulations could impact its service provider customers' purchasing decisions and its own regulated offerings, potentially harming product sales.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly. In addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of data, including for regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers' ability to  use,  and  our  ability  to  sell,  our  products  and  services.  The  interpretation  and  application  of  these  laws  in  some  instances  is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes. For example, the European Union's ('EU') General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU and imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Additionally, we are subject to California's Consumer Privacy Act and other laws, regulations and obligations that relate to the handling  of  personal  data.  Our  actual  or  perceived  failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  or  other  obligations relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could subject us to liability to  our  customers,  data  subjects,  suppliers,  business  partners,  employees,  and  others,  give  rise  to  legal  and/or  regulatory  action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n## Our  business,  operating  results  and  financial  condition  could  be  materially  harmed  by  evolving  regulatory  uncertainty  or obligations applicable to our products and services.\n\nChanges in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate, in the United States and in other countries, could  materially  affect  the  sales  of  our  products  and  services.  In  particular,  economic  sanctions  and  changes  to  export  control requirements,  have  impacted  and  may  continue  to  impact  our  ability  to  sell  and  support  our  products  and  services  in  certain jurisdictions. In addition, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service provider customers' purchase of our products and services, and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offerings. Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact  sales  of  our  products  and  services  include  laws  and  regulations  related  to  encryption  technology,  environmental sustainability  (including  climate  change),  human  rights,  product  certification,  and  national  security  controls  applicable  to  our supply chain. For example, new laws and regulations in response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency requirements for our products and increased compliance and energy costs. Changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\n\n## Our stock price may be volatile.\n\nHistorically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial  results  and  the  published  expectations  of  analysts  and  as  a  result  of  announcements  by  our  competitors  and  us. Furthermore,  speculation  in  the  press  or  investment  community  about  our  strategic  position,  financial  condition,  results  of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  in  the  future. Additionally,  volatility,  lack  of  positive  performance  in  our  stock  price  or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\nOther regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position  that  our  offerings  such  as  Microsoft  Teams  and  Skype  are  covered  by  existing  laws  regulating  telecommunications services,  and  some  new  laws,  including  EU  Member  State  laws  under  the  European  Electronic  Communications  Code,  are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. Regulators may assert that our  collection,  use,  and  management  of  customer  data  and  other  information  is  inconsistent  with  their  laws  and  regulations, including  laws  that  apply  to  the  tracking  of  users  via  technology  such  as  cookies.  Legislative  or  regulatory  action  relating  to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative and regulatory  action  is  emerging  in  the  areas  of  AI  and  content  moderation,  which  could  increase  costs  or  restrict  opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments' approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\n\nWe strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally  relies  increasingly  on  the  movement  of  data  across  national  boundaries.  Legal  requirements  relating  to  the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States. This  ruling  continues  to  generate  uncertainty  about  the  legal  requirements  for  data  transfers  from  the  EU  under  other  legal mechanisms and has resulted in some EU data protection authorities blocking the use of U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. The U.S. and the EU in March 2022 agreed in principle on a replacement framework for the Privacy Shield, called the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. A failure of the U.S. and EU to finalize the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework  could  compound  that  uncertainty  and  result  in  additional  blockages  of  data  transfers.  Potential  new  rules  and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand  for  our  offerings  if  we  are  unable  to  engineer  products  that  meet  our  legal  duties  or  help  our  customers  meet  their obligations under the GDPR and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties (of up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling or transfer of personal data.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States  requires  us  to  make  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Note  2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  describes  the  significant accounting  policies  and  methods  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  accounting  policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions,  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  and  actual  results  could  differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\n\nThe  inputs  into  certain  of  our  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  considered  the  economic  implications  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, including the associated impact of supply constraints, on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2022. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together  with  other  resources  that  are  readily  available  and  whether  our  commitment  to  transfer  the  product  or  service  to  the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\n\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  in  exchange  for  those  products  or  services.  Transfer  of  control  occurs  once  the customer  has  the  contractual  right  to  use  the  product,  generally  upon  shipment,  electronic  delivery  (or  when  the  software  is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control,  with  the  associated  software  maintenance  revenue  recognized  ratably  over  the  contract  term  as  services  and  software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\n\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to  for  the  promised  goods  or  services  based  on  standalone  selling  prices  (SSP).  SSP  is  estimated  for  each  distinct  performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n\nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.",

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Nature of Products and Services\n\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer.  Customers  may  purchase  perpetual  licenses  or  subscribe  to  licenses,  which  provide  customers  with  the  same functionality  and  differ  mainly  in  the  duration  over  which  the  customer  benefits  from  the  software.  Revenue  from  distinct  onpremises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we  allocate  revenue  to  software  updates,  primarily  because  the  updates  are  provided  at  no  additional  charge,  revenue  is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\n\nCertain  volume  licensing  programs,  including  Enterprise  Agreements,  include  on-premises  licenses  combined  with  Software Assurance ('SA'). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and  training  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  products  more  efficiently.  On-premises  licenses  are  considered  distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers  simultaneously  consume  and  receive  benefits,  given  that  SA  comprises  distinct  performance  obligations  that  are satisfied over time.\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is  recognized  based  on  the  customer  utilization  of  such  resources.  When  cloud  services require  a  significant  level  of  integration  and  interdependency  with  software  and  the  individual  components  are  not  considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nRevenue  from  search  advertising  is  recognized  when  the  advertisement  appears  in  the  search  results  or  when  the  action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\n\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.\n\n## Significant Judgments\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a  customer.  Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.",

      "question": "Considering ACN's $22 million net gain from designated cash flow hedges and ADBE's strategic investments in privately held companies, how do their respective financial exposures and strategic intents differ in managing investments in private firms, and what might this indicate about their risk tolerance and market positioning in the IT sector?",
      "answer": "ACN's financial exposure to investments in privately held companies is minimal, as stated in their 10-K filing, with a $22 million net gain expected to be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. This indicates that ACN's investments are more aligned with hedging and managing operational costs rather than seeking substantial financial returns. In contrast, ADBE strategically invests in privately held firms to gain insights into technological developments and expand opportunities for their product ecosystem, suggesting a more proactive and innovation-driven approach. This difference in strategic intent implies that ADBE may have a higher tolerance for risk in exchange for potential market leadership in emerging technologies, while ACN focuses on mitigating risk and maintaining operational efficiency.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utiliz ed as counterparties.\n\nCertain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Chinese yuan, U.S. dollar/A ustralian dollar and U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair v alue of these deriv ativ es are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements. A dditionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, typically have maturities not exceeding three years and are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nFor designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. A s of A ugust 31, 2024, it was anticipated that approximately $22 million of net gains, net of tax, currently  recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.\n\nWe use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity  of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A  10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $655 million and $856 million as of A ugust 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of A ugust 31, 2024 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.\n\n## Equity Investment Risk\n\nOur non-marketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments.\n\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluations of privately held companies are based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of A ugust 31, 2024.",

Solution-specific skills assessments help our enterprise customers objectively assess the knowledge and competencies within their marketing teams and tailor their learning priorities accordingly.\n\n## Investments\n\nFrom time to time, we make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  technological  developments  in  the  industry  and  ex pand  our  opportunities  to  provide Adobe products, services, and solutions.\n\n## RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT\n\nWith the speed of innovation and technological change that characterizes the software industry, a continuous high level of investment is required for the research and development of the cutting-edge technologies that lead to the development of new products, services and solutions and the continual enhancement of existing products, services and solutions. Our Adobe Research team of research scientists, engineers, artists and designers help turn ideas into technologies that power the future of our products, services and solutions.

In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe  protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign  intellectual  property  laws, confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and  pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile Apps to users and customers under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  and  customers  under  'click  through'  or  signed  agreements containing  restrictions  on  access  and  use.  Our  enterprise  customers  license  our  hosted  offerings  as  SaaS  or  Managed  Services  via  agreements  based  on  our enterprise licensing terms.\n\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop Apps with the same functionality as our Apps. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.",

M ethodologies for reporting ESG data may be updated and previously reported ESG data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances. Our processes and controls for reporting ESG matters across our operations are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required by the SEC, European and other regulators, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.\n\n## Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.\n\nOur clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract A udit A gency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost A ccounting Standards and the Federal A cquisition Regulation. These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting, information technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries, or failure to comply with applicable IT security or supply chain requirements, could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time, or result in other adverse consequences described in the following paragraphs. In addition, if the U.S. gov ernment concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work. Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. A s a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.\n- If a gov ernment client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, or alleges that such conduct occurred, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims A ct, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.\n- U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and heightened disclosure obligations. From time to time we have made required or voluntary disclosures to the government in connection with our government contracting work. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of 'credible evidence' of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters may also lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including those described above. For example, after A ccenture Federal Services ('A FS') made a voluntary disclosure to the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of Justice ('DOJ') initiated a civil and criminal investigation concerning whether one or more employees provided inaccurate submissions to an assessor who was evaluating on behalf of the U.S. government an AFS service offering and whether the service offering fully implemented required federal security controls. This matter could subject to us to adverse consequences, including those described in this risk factor.\n- Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity , regardless of its accuracy , may  adv ersely  affect our reputation.\n- Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate. For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.\n- Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these",

We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. While we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.\n\nWe provide products, services and solutions, directly and indirectly, to a variety of domestic and foreign government entities, which introduces certain risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements, including varying governmental budgeting processes, fluctuations due to government spending cuts and shutdowns, highly competitive and lengthy bidding process that may be subject to political influence and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. We incur significant up-front time and costs without any assurance that we will win a contract. Operating within a highly regulated industry, we have been and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in termination of contracts and various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results. We have made, and may continue to make, significant investments to support future sales opportunities in various government sectors, including to obtain various security authorizations and certifications. Such processes are complex, lengthy and can often be delayed. Furthermore, requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more government authorizations or certifications, which could affect our ability to sell to government entities until we meet any new or revised requirements.\n\n## Risks Related to Financial Performance\n\n## If there is a change in subscriptions or renewals in a reporting period, this could cause our financial results to suffer and may not be immediately reflected in our revenue and financial results for that period because we recognize revenue over the subscription term.\n\nOur offerings are typically subscription-based, pursuant to product and service agreements. We generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Lower sales and subscriptions, reduced demand for our products, services and solutions, and increases in our attrition rate in any given period may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers' level of satisfaction, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, reliability of our offerings, prices of ours and competitors' offerings, the actual  or  perceived  information  security  of  our  systems  and  services,  decreases  in  the  size  of  our  customer  base,  changes  as  a  result  of  regulatory  or  legal requirements, changes in the composition of our customer base and reductions in our customers' spending levels or declines in customer activity. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline. Further, such impact on our revenue may not be immediately reflected in our financial results in the period in which our renewal rates changed and may adversely affect our financial results in future periods. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may suffer and vary from those anticipated.\n\n## We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.\n\nOur  operating  results  and  performance  metrics  are  subject  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates  due  to  the  global  scope  of  our  business. Geopolitical and economic events, including war, trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market volatility, and associated uncertainty have caused, and may in the future cause, currencies to fluctuate. Accordingly, amounts reported as annualized recurring revenue, a performance metric which we measure at currency rates that are set at the beginning of each fiscal year and held constant throughout the year, may vary from actual revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\n\nWe attempt to mitigate a portion of these foreign currency exchange risks to our operating results through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments that we believe are appropriate. Our hedging activities have not, and may not in the future, offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact, including on our actual revenue recognized, resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition, business performance or results of operations.",

Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability.

      "answer": "Apple faces inventory write-down risks due to service outages because defects or performance issues in its products can lead to poor market acceptance, reduced demand, and delays in new product introductions. This directly impacts Apple's financial exposure as it records write-downs for obsolete or excess inventory, with manufacturing purchase obligations covering up to 150 days of forecasted component needs. On the other hand, Accenture's exposure from service outages is tied to reputational damage that could lead to client loss and difficulty in retaining talent. A service outage could undermine client confidence in Accenture\u2019s ability to deliver reliable IT services and consulting, potentially leading to contract non-renewals or reduced demand for its services, especially in a competitive market where clients may shift to global capability centers or more integrated solution providers. While Apple's financial risk is tied to tangible asset write-downs, Accenture's is linked to intangible assets like brand equity and client relationships.",

Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company , often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury . These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. A s a result, from time to time the Company's services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user's device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory , property , plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\n\n## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews longliv ed assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. A lthough the Company believes its inventory , capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments.  M anufacturing  purchase obligations cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\n## The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company's products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.

Our competitors may also team together to create competing offerings.\n\nEven if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients. Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these markets more challenging. Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive pricing or contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the markets we currently serve. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers, acquisitions or teaming arrangements. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours. New services or technologies offered by competitors, ecosystem partners or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternativ es, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The technology companies described above, including many of our ecosystem partners, are increasingly able to offer services related to their software, platform, cloud migration and other solutions, or are developing software, platform, cloud migration and other solutions that require integration services to a lesser extent or replace them in their entirety. These more integrated services and solutions may represent more attractive alternatives to clients than some of our services and solutions, which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.\n\n## Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.\n\nWe believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients or competitors, cybersecurity incidents or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery or solution failures, compliance violations, government investigations or legal proceedings. We may also experience reputational damage from employees, advocacy groups, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer, the clients or markets that we serve, or the ways in which we operate our business. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, ecosystem partners, joint v enture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers and advocacy groups.\n\nThere is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about A ccenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, ex pensiv e and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements or could negatively impact our relationships with ecosystem partners, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the A ccenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\n\nOur brand and reputation are also associated with our public commitments to various corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. Our disclosures on these matters and any failure or perceived failure to achieve or accurately report on our commitments, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our client relationships or our recruitment and retention efforts, as well as expose us to potential legal liability. In addition, positions we take or do not take on these issues may be unpopular with some of our employees, our clients or potential clients, our investors, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the media, or advocacy groups, which may impact our ability to attract or retain employees or the demand for our services. We also may choose not to conduct business with potential clients or discontinue or not expand business with existing clients due to these positions.",

      "answer": "Apple's indemnification exposure is described qualitatively as potentially significant due to its involvement in numerous legal proceedings, including patent claims, and its contractual obligations to indemnify third parties. This broad exposure could materially affect its financial condition if claims exceed expectations or insurance coverage. In contrast, Accenture quantifies its indemnification liabilities, reporting $2,370,000 in aggregate potential liability as of August 31, 2024, with only $61,000 unrecoverable from third parties, indicating a more defined and limited exposure. Accenture's structured approach, including contractual recourse and limited liability guarantees, suggests a more controlled risk management strategy compared to Apple's less predictable and potentially larger exposure. These differences highlight how Accenture's use of defined liability caps and recourse provisions may lead to more predictable financial outcomes, while Apple's broader indemnification commitments align with its larger scale and more complex legal environment, which may be perceived as riskier by investors.",

In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party . The number of claims, legal proceedings and government  investigations  involving  the  Company ,  and  the  alleged  magnitude  of  such  claims,  proceedings  and  government  investigations,  has  generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges.  There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.  These agreements can also significantly increase the Company's cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to offer certain products and services.\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company , and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\n## The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company's business.\n\nThe Company's global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy , data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability  of third-party  software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions;  anti-money  laundering;  foreign  ownership  and  investment;  tax;  and  environmental,  health  and  safety ,  including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company's business by increasing the Company's costs, limiting the Company's ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company's products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company's products and services, and requiring changes to the Company's business or supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company's products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company's employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company's policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.",

Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Indemnifications and Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.\n\nTypically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments we made in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the client's claim. Payments we made under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.\n\nAs of A ugust 31, 2024 and 2023, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $2,370,000 and $1,793,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $61,000 and $51,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.\n\nAs of A ugust 31, 2024 and 2023, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $1,758,783 ($1,609,046 net of recourse provisions) and $1,294,653 ($1,213,375 net of recourse provisions) respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\n\nTo date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.\n\n## Legal Contingencies\n\nAs of A ugust 31, 2024, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, except as otherwise noted below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n\nOn July 24, 2019, A ccenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of M arriott International, Inc. ('M arriott') in the U.S. District Court for the District of M ary land. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys' fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. ('Starwood'), which was acquired by M arriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On M ay 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, which we appealed. On A ugust 17, 2023, the appeals court vacated the class certification and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of, among other things, the class action waiver signed by Starwood customer plaintiffs. On November 29, 2023, the district court reinstated the classes previously certified by the court in M ay 2022. We are appealing the district court's decision. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. A t present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company , often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury . These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. A s a result, from time to time the Company's services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user's device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory , property , plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\n\n## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews longliv ed assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. A lthough the Company believes its inventory , capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments.  M anufacturing  purchase obligations cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\n## The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company's products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property , or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100% of the equity. This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing working capital adjustments. A lternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability  or competitiv e position in specific markets or serv ices.\n\nWe also periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and people, the diversion of management's attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. A fter reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability  with respect to the div ested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the div ested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. A ny divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.\n\nWe are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation inv olv ing current and former employees, clients, ecosystem partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management's attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties, debarment or injunctive relief against us. A ny claims or litigation, ev en if fully  indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\n\nWe could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, ecosystem partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients, or if our serv ices or solutions cause bodily injuries to our people, clients, or the public or property damage. For example, by taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients' businesses, including functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, by contributing to the design, development, manufacturing and/or engineering of client products, or by providing various operational technology, digital manufacturing and robotics or other industrial automation equipment solutions, and advisory, management and engineering services for infrastructure projects, we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational, regulatory, reputational or other risks specific to these areas, including risks related to data security, product liability, health and safety, hazardous materials and other environmental risks. A  failure of a client's sy stem, product or infrastructure based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn order to remain competitive, we increasingly enter into agreements based on our clients' contract terms after conducting an assessment of the risk of doing so, which may expose us to additional risk. In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the industry. We may commit to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability  is not adequately  limited through the terms of our agreements, liability  limitations are not enforced or a third party  alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. M oreover, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas.",

This affects its hardware and software offerings, including key products like iPhones, iPads, and proprietary services such as the App Store and Apple Music. Accenture, on the other hand, discloses that it could face substantial financial exposure due to indemnification clauses in its contracts, where it agrees to cover clients' legal costs if third-party intellectual property rights are allegedly infringed by Accenture\u2019s services, including AI and software solutions.

Elections, changes in government or political developments, including government closures or shutdowns, budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.\n\n- Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.\n- Our ability to work for the U.S. government is impacted by the fact that we are an Irish company. We elected to enter into a proxy agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense that enhances the ability of our U.S. federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the U.S. government. The proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of, and limits the control we can exercise over, this subsidiary. In addition, legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could place additional limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations. Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While A ccenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects A ccenture.\n\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.\n\n## If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platforms, methodologies, processes, software, hardware and other solutions. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection. For example, the intellectual property legal landscape relating to A I (including generative A I) is ex pected to continue to evolve in many countries in which we operate. A s a result, there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for A I models, software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. Even where we obtain intellectual property protection, our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors, former employees, or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.\n\nIn addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our A I, software and hardware solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property  rights of third parties (including competitors as well as non-practicing holders of intellectual property assets), and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Furthermore, although we have established policies and procedures to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property, we may not be aware if our employees have misappropriated and/or misused intellectual property, and their actions could result in claims of intellectual property misappropriation and/or infringement from third parties. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. A ny  related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.

If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:\n\n- general economic and political conditions;\n- our clients' desire to reduce their costs;\n- the competitive environment in our industry;\n- our ability to accurately estimate our service delivery costs, upon which our pricing is sometimes determined, including our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery costs over long-term contracts; and\n- the procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.\n\nOur profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive . The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics. In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer. Competitors may be willing, at times, to take on more risk or price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.\n\nOur profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.\n\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nMoreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms, any of which could significantly affect our profitability. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients' actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.",

      "answer": "Oracle believes that blockchain is a key advanced technology natively incorporated into its Cloud SaaS offerings, enhancing productivity and business processes by providing secure data isolation, flexible upgrades, and self-service access controls. In contrast, Accenture identifies blockchain as part of a set of evolving technologies that expose the company to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, and technological risks, which could negatively affect its reputation and demand for services.

Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. Risks in this section are grouped in the following categories: (1) Business Risks; (2) Financial Risks; (3) Operational Risks; and (4) Legal and Regulatory Risks. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Business Risks\n\nOur results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients' businesses and levels of business activity.\n\nGlobal macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect us, our clients' businesses and the markets they serve. Volatile, negative and uncertain economic and political conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, and resulting in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which negatively affects our business. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOngoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns, changes in global trade policies, global health emergencies and their impact on us, our clients and the industries we serve, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nOur business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nOur financial results depend in part on the demand for our services and solutions, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering, intelligent connected products, digital engineering and manufacturing, and robotics solutions. As we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.",

During  the  year  ended December  25,  2021,  the  Company  repurchased  16.7  million  shares  of  its  common  stock  under  the  Repurchase Program for $1.8 billion. As of December 25, 2021, $2.2 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this  program.  This  Repurchase  Program  does  not  obligate  the  Company  to  acquire  any  common  stock,  has  no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company's employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company's stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 2004 Plan). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company introduced the 2017 ESPP, as amended and restated (the 2017 Plan).\n\nUnder the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire within seven years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards.\n\nUnder the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs.\n\nStock Options. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.\n\nTime-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company's common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied.\n\nPRSUs. PRSUs  can  be  granted  to  certain  of  the  Company's  senior  executives.  The  performance  metrics  can  be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company's financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives  at  the  end  of  the  period  may  range  from  0%  to  250%  of  the  Target  Shares  granted,  depending  upon  the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award.",

At the time an investment is made, investments  in  commercial  paper  of  industrial  firms  and  financial  institutions  are  rated  A1,  P1,  F1  or  better.  The Company invests in tax-exempt securities including municipal notes and bonds and bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.\n\nThe Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company's customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. The Company's top three customers with the highest accounts receivable balances each accounted for approximately 20%, 15% and 9% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 25, 2021 and 18%, 17% and 6%, of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 26, 2020. However, the Company does not believe  the  receivable  balance  from  these  customers  represents  a  significant  credit  risk  based  on  past  collection experience and review of their current credit quality.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are large global institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.\n\n## NOTE 10 - Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.\n\nDiluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company's stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants.  Potentially  dilutive  shares  issuable  upon  conversion  of  the  2.125%  Convertible  Senior  Notes  due  2026 (2.125% Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method.\n\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share:\n\n",

      "question": "Both Apple and Oracle mention risks related to component constraints in their 2022 10-K filings. Apple notes that it orders components up to 150 days in advance and faces risks of inventory write-downs due to forecast inaccuracies, while Oracle states that supply chain shortages have led to increased inventory purchases and higher inventory excess and obsolescence risk. What is the combined impact of these inventory risk strategies on their respective operating cash flows, and how do component constraints specifically drive this financial outcome for each company?",
      "answer": "Apple faces inventory write-down risks due to its 150-day component ordering strategy, which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory if forecasts are incorrect. Oracle has increased inventory purchases to secure manufacturing capacity due to supply chain shortages, which has elevated its inventory excess and obsolescence risk. Both companies experience negative impacts on operating cash flows as a result of these inventory risk strategies, with Oracle explicitly noting this impact. Component constraints drive Apple's forecast inaccuracy risk and Oracle's need to secure manufacturing capacity, leading to increased financial exposure in both cases.",

        "Step 3: Extract from source B - Oracle has responded to supply chain shortages by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity, which has in some instances increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and adversely impacted operating cash flows.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Component constraints specifically drive inventory risk strategies for both companies: Apple faces write-down risks due to its long forecasting window and potential forecast inaccuracies, while Oracle increases inventory purchases to secure capacity, both leading to negative impacts on operating cash flow."

          "chunk_text": "The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained,  or  when  an  outsourcing  partner  has  delayed  shipments  of  completed  products  to  the  Company,  the  Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected  depending  on  the  time  required  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  from  the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\n## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe  Company  offers  complex  hardware  and  software  products  and  services  that  can  be  affected  by  design  and  manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company's services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues  and  defects  in  the  hardware,  software  and  services  it  offers.  Failure  to  do  so  can  result  in  widespread  technical  and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and/or  intangible assets,  and  significant  warranty  and  other  expenses,  including  litigation  costs  and  regulatory  fines.  Quality  problems  can  also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market  acceptance,  reduced  demand  for  products  and  services,  delay  in  new  product  and service introductions and lost sales.\n\n## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe  Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Although  the  Company  believes  its  inventory,  capital  assets,  inventory  prepayments  and  other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments. Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  cover  the  Company's  forecasted  component  and  manufacturing  requirements,  typically  for periods  up  to  150  days.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are  volatile,  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid  technology  and  price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\n## The  Company  relies  on  access  to  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  may  not  be  available  to  the  Company  on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in  the  future  may  compete,  current  extensive  patent  coverage  and  the  rapid  rate  of  issuance  of  new  patents,  the  Company's products  and  services  can  unknowingly  infringe  existing  patents  or  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  From  time  to  time,  the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

Any  failure  to  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  or  a  market perception  that  we  do  not  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  our  ability  to  sell  and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.\n\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the sourcing  of  technologies  and  components,  the  results  of  these  businesses  will  suffer. We  depend  on  suppliers  to  develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could also be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest,  other  public  health  crises,  changes  to  trade  policies,  port  stoppages  or  other  transportation  disruptions  or  slowdowns,  or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers. We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products  to  a  variety  of  companies,  many  of  which  are  located  outside  the  U.S.  From  time  to  time,  these  partners  experience production problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created, and likely will continue to create, delays in our supply chain. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused delays in the manufacturing and fulfilment of certain customer orders during fiscal 2022. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\n\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline. Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:\n\n- our focus on certain of our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and certain other hardware products we consider strategic and the de-emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products;\n- changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products;\n- decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives; and\n- general supply chain material shortages worldwide, which were further exacerbated globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity, which has in some instances increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and adversely impacted our operating cash flows.\n\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive.

      "answer": "Apple's gross margins are subject to volatility due to factors such as supply shortages, potential increases in the cost of components, and manufacturing services. These risks are directly tied to its reliance on manufacturing partners, and any disruptions could materially affect its results of operations and financial condition. Oracle, on the other hand, reported that its hardware business, which accounted for 7% of total revenues in fiscal 2022, is particularly affected by global supply chain constraints, especially for large hardware transactions. These constraints have made quarterly hardware revenues more difficult to predict and have affected cost and operating margins. While Apple faces margin pressure from component and manufacturing cost increases, Oracle's hardware revenue performance is directly impacted by the ability of manufacturing partners to deliver large transactions on time, showing distinct but supply-chain-related financial risks for each company.",

Changes to the Company's business practices  to  comply  with  new  laws  and  regulations  or  in  connection  with  other  legal  proceedings  could  negatively  impact  the reputation  of  the  Company's  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the Company's products and services, and result in  harm  to  the  Company's  reputation,  loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\n## The  Company's  business  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  and  international  laws,  rules,  policies  and  other  obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data  and  biometric  data.  Health  data  and  financial  data  are  subject  to  additional  privacy,  security  and  breach  notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations.  If  the  Company  fails  to  adequately  comply  with  these  rules  and  requirements,  or  if  health  data  or  financial  data  is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures  and  product  pricing  actions  that  the  Company  may  take  in  response  to  such  pressures;  increased  competition;  the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its  product  and  service  offerings;  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates;  inflation  and  other  macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand  for  that  product  could  significantly  impact  quarterly  net  sales.  The  Company  could  also  be  subject  to  unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service introductions,  information  technology  system  failures  or  network  disruptions,  or  failure  of  one  of  the  Company's  logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.",

Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent  and  interrelated  and  are  accounted  for  as  a  combined  performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to  the  customer  and  ownership  is  transferred  to  the  customer.  We  expect  to  make  investments  in  research  and  development  to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.\n\nWe generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.\n\nOur quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners' abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, with this factor becoming more pronounced in recent periods due to global supply chain constraints for certain  technology  components;  our  strategy  for  and  the  position  of  our  hardware  products  relative  to  competitor  offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n\n## Services Business\n\nOur services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2022 and 2021, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are  differentiated  based  on  our  focus  on  Oracle  technologies,  extensive  experience,  broad  sets  of  intellectual  property  and  best practices.  Our  services  offerings  include  consulting  services  and  advanced  customer  services.  Our  services  business  has  lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions;",

      "question": "How do Apple and Oracle's financial risks from reseller distribution channels differ, given Apple's concentration of trade receivables among resellers and Oracle's global reseller marketing strategy?",
      "answer": "Apple faces significant credit risk from its reseller distribution channel, as a substantial majority of its outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance, with exposure concentrated among cellular network carriers and other resellers globally. As of September 24, 2022, Apple's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few vendors in Asia. In contrast, Oracle markets its products and services to resellers through the Oracle Partner Network but does not disclose any specific credit risk concentrations or financial exposure related to its reseller channel. This means Apple explicitly reports financial risk tied to resellers, while Oracle's filing does not quantify such risk despite its reseller-focused distribution strategy.",

        "Step 3: From Oracle's 10-K, extract the fact that it distributes products through resellers via the Oracle Partner Network but does not disclose any financial risk concentrations or credit exposure related to this channel.",
        "Step 4: Compare the explicit financial risk Apple discloses versus the absence of such risk quantification from Oracle, despite both using resellers as a key distribution channel."

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated  sales  and  earnings,  and  generally  leads  the  Company  to  raise  international  pricing,  potentially  reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\n\nConversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and  resellers.  The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  services  directly  to  small  and  mid-sized  businesses  and  education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables  can  be  concentrated  within  cellular  network  carriers  or  other  resellers.  The  Company's  exposure  to  credit  and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade  and  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  as  well  as  long-term  prepayments,  there  can  be  no  assurance  such  procedures  will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\n## The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16",

Our products and services include  enterprise  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  that  are  delivered  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and interoperable  IT  deployment  models.  These  models  include  on-premise  deployments,  cloud-based  deployments,  and  hybrid deployments  (an  approach  that  combines  both  on-premise  and  cloud-based  deployment)  such  as  our  Oracle  Cloud@Customer offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer's  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our customers  and  facilitate  the  product,  service  and  deployment  combinations  that  best  suit  our  customers'  needs.  Our  customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build,  deploy,  run,  manage  and  support  their  internal  and  external  products,  services  and  business  operations  including,  for example, a global cloud applications developer that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to power its software-as-a-service (SaaS)  offerings;  a  multi-national  financial  institution  that  runs  its  banking  applications  using  the  Oracle  Exadata  Database Machine;  and  a  global  consumer  products  company  that  leverages  Oracle  Fusion  Cloud  Enterprise  Resource  Planning  for  its accounting processes, consolidation and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle Cloud Services offerings, which include Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings, provide comprehensive and integrated applications and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models.  Oracle  Cloud  Services  integrate  the  IT  components, including software, hardware and services, on a customer's behalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for the customer and that a customer may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.\n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standardsbased and reliable.\n\nOracle  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n\nOracle  hardware  products  include  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage  and  industry-specific  products,  among  others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n\nOracle also offers services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.\n\nProviding  choice  and  flexibility  to  Oracle  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and  better  addresses  customer  needs  relative  to  our  competitors,  many  of  whom  provide  fewer  offerings,  more  restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer's transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we invested $7.2 billion, $6.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another including through the use of OCI to power our Oracle Fusion SaaS Applications, which we and our customers use to run internal business processes. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings",

      "question": "How does the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom (AVGO) and Microsoft's (MSFT) competitive positioning against Cisco Systems reflect on their respective infrastructure software and cloud strategies, especially considering Broadcom's focus on bolstering its infrastructure software through acquisitions and Microsoft's emphasis on Azure and cloud services?",
      "answer": "Broadcom's acquisition of VMware for $84.2 billion (including $30.8 billion in cash and $53.4 billion in stock) demonstrates its strategic intent to strengthen its infrastructure software portfolio, aligning with its broader business strategy of leveraging acquisitions to deliver comprehensive infrastructure technology solutions. Meanwhile, Microsoft competes directly with Cisco Systems in enterprise communications and cloud services, particularly through its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure\u2014a comprehensive cloud platform that enables businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications across a global network of data centers. Microsoft's focus on Azure's AI-optimized infrastructure and cloud-based services contrasts with Cisco's position in enterprise communications equipment, as Microsoft seeks to provide integrated, secure, and flexible productivity tools. Thus, while Broadcom's acquisition of VMware directly enhances its infrastructure software capabilities, Microsoft's competitive stance against Cisco is rooted in its cloud-first strategy through Azure and its ecosystem of integrated cloud services.",

      "question": "How do Cisco and Intel differ in their financial statement treatment of shares withheld for tax purposes, and what is the resulting impact on each company's reported share counts?",
      "answer": "Cisco treats shares withheld for tax purposes as common stock repurchases in its financial statements, even though they are not included in the official repurchase program table. This reduces the number of shares issued upon vesting and effectively lowers the company's reported share count. Intel, on the other hand, issues shares net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements, meaning it withholds shares to cover taxes but does not treat these withholdings as repurchases under its program. Instead, Intel pays the tax obligation in cash. As a result, Intel's withheld shares do not directly reduce its reported share count in the same way as Cisco's approach does.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Cisco's filing, we learn that shares withheld for tax purposes are treated as common stock repurchases in the financial statements, even though they are not counted in the official repurchase program table. This directly reduces the number of shares issued upon vesting and thus lowers the reported share count.",
        "Step 2: From Intel's filing, we see that shares issued upon RSU vesting are netted against the minimum statutory withholding requirements, but the company pays the tax obligation in cash. These withheld shares are not treated as repurchases under the stock repurchase program, and therefore do not reduce the share count in the same way as Cisco's approach.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both approaches, Cisco's treatment results in a more direct reduction of its reported share count through financial statement repurchases, while Intel's method does not formally reduce the share count under its repurchase program, even though shares are withheld."

      "answer": "Cisco incorporates sovereign risk into its internal credit risk ratings when assessing the collectibility of financing receivables. If Cisco were to extend financing to customers in China purchasing Intel products, it would evaluate the sovereign risk of operating in China, including geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions. Intel reported that $3.2 billion (6%) of its 2023 revenue depended on U.S. government export control authorizations. If Cisco applied its sovereign risk assessment methodology to these Chinese customers, it could assign a higher risk rating due to the uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade tensions and export controls. This would increase Cisco\u2019s estimated credit loss exposure and could result in higher financing costs, reduced credit availability, or even denial of financing for these customers. Consequently, this could limit Intel\u2019s ability to sell to those customers, directly impacting the $3.2 billion portion of Intel\u2019s revenue that relies on export authorizations.",

      "question": "How do the collateral security arrangements of Cisco and Intel differently affect their credit risk exposure in derivative transactions, particularly considering the amounts of cash collateral provided and the credit exposure limits described?",
      "answer": "Cisco's collateral security arrangements involve posting cash collateral based on the fair market value of derivative instruments, with $11 million and $40 million provided as of July 27, 2024, and July 29, 2023, respectively. These arrangements are designed to reduce credit risk by allowing net settlement with counterparties. Intel also uses collateral security arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions, limiting exposure to $1.6 billion as of December 30, 2023, with cash collateral exchanged included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Both companies use master netting and collateral arrangements to reduce credit risk; however, Cisco specifies exact cash collateral amounts, while Intel emphasizes exposure limits and the classification of collateral within specific balance sheet accounts. This indicates that while both companies aim to reduce credit risk through similar mechanisms, their specific approaches and reporting granularity differ.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Cisco's collateral security arrangements involve cash postings of $11 million and $40 million as of July 2024 and July 2023, respectively, to reduce credit risk in derivative transactions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Intel limits credit exposure to $1.6 billion as of December 30, 2023, through collateral security arrangements, with collateral classified in specific asset and liability line items.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Cisco and Intel use collateral security arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions, but Cisco provides specific cash collateral figures, while Intel focuses on exposure limits and classification of collateral."

      "answer": "ACN highlights that their business depends on maintaining client demand for their services, which could be negatively affected by developments in areas such as robotic process automation (RPA). MSFT's investment in RPA through the Microsoft Power Platform, which includes low-code/no-code tools and automation capabilities, could enable clients to develop internal automation solutions, reducing reliance on external service providers like ACN. This aligns with ACN's stated risk that an inability to respond to evolving technologies could materially affect their results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. Risks in this section are grouped in the following categories: (1) Business Risks; (2) Financial Risks; (3) Operational Risks; and (4) Legal and Regulatory Risks. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Business Risks\n\nOur results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients' businesses and levels of business activity.\n\nGlobal macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect us, our clients' businesses and the markets they serve. Volatile, negative and uncertain economic and political conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, and resulting in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which negatively affects our business. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOngoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns, changes in global trade policies, global health emergencies and their impact on us, our clients and the industries we serve, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nOur business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nOur financial results depend in part on the demand for our services and solutions, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering, intelligent connected products, digital engineering and manufacturing, and robotics solutions. As we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.",

We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\n## The Ambitions That Drive Us\n\nTo achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:\n\n- Reinvent productivity and business processes.\n- Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.\n- Create more personal computing.\n\n## Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes\n\nAt Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment. Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.\n\nOur growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and  services,  including  Office  365,  Dynamics  365,  and  LinkedIn.  Microsoft  365  brings  together  Office  365,  Windows,  and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase collaboration,  and  fuel  innovation,  all  the  while  enabling  compliance  coverage  and  data  protection.  Microsoft  Teams  is  a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience  platform  that  brings  together  communications,  knowledge,  learning,  resources,  and  insights  powered  by Microsoft  365.  Together  with  the  Microsoft  Cloud,  Dynamics  365,  Microsoft  Teams,  and  Azure  Synapse  bring  a  new  era  of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. In a dynamic labor market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired.\n\n## Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform\n\nAs  digital  transformation  accelerates,  organizations  in  every  sector  across  the  globe  can  address  challenges  that  will  have  a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. Microsoft has a proven track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets.\n\nWe continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while offering  openness,  improving  time  to  value,  reducing  costs,  and  increasing  agility.  Being  a  global-scale  cloud, Azure  uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices,  from  Internet  of  Things  ('IoT')  sensors  to  gateway  devices  and  edge  hardware  to  build,  manage,  and  secure  edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge.",

      "answer": "Accenture leverages its strong ecosystem relationship with SAP, among other leading technology providers, to enhance its service offerings and deliver distinctive business value to clients. This partnership enables Accenture to integrate SAP's enterprise software capabilities into its consulting and technology services, supporting clients in areas like digital transformation, intelligent operations, and cloud integration. In contrast, Microsoft directly competes with SAP in key areas such as database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions. This competitive dynamic drives Microsoft to differentiate its enterprise offerings by emphasizing advantages in performance, total cost of ownership, and productivity through superior applications and development tools. As a result, Accenture's strategy centers on collaboration and integration within a broad tech ecosystem, while Microsoft focuses on outperforming SAP through innovation and platform superiority in enterprise computing.",

This segment primarily comprises:\n\n- Windows,  including  Windows  OEM  licensing  ('Windows  OEM')  and  other  non-volume  licensing  of  the  Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.\n- Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.\n- Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games  and  in-game  content),  Xbox  Game  Pass  and  other  subscriptions,  Xbox  Cloud  Gaming,  third-party  disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.\n- Search and news advertising.\n\n## Windows\n\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:\n\n- The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.\n- Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.\n- Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.\n- Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.\n- Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.\n- Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.\n- Constraints in the supply chain of device components.\n- Piracy.",

      "answer": "Oracle disclosed 6 distinct debt instruments, including the 2040 Note, with maturity years spanning from 2022 to 2047. NVIDIA disclosed 1 distinct debt instrument, the 2040 Note, with only one maturity year. Therefore, Oracle demonstrated a broader range of debt instrument maturities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, NVIDIA's exhibit list (Exhibit 4.10 specifically) shows the Form of 2040 Note as one distinct debt instrument among several others, but only the 2040 Note is relevant to this question.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Oracle's exhibit list includes the Form of New 2040 Note (Exhibit 4.07) and five additional debt instruments (Exhibits 4.08 through 4.14) with maturity years ranging from 2022 to 2047.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the distinct debt instruments from both companies: NVIDIA lists the 2040 Note (1 instrument), while Oracle lists the 2040 Note plus five other notes maturing in different years (6 instruments total), with a broader maturity range."

In contrast, ORCL quantifies the financial impact of regulatory compliance, specifically noting a $118 million revenue reduction in fiscal 2022 due to the withdrawal of operations from Russia and Belarus following sanctions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. While NVDA highlights the uncertainty and complexity of compliance in a global regulatory environment, ORCL demonstrates a concrete financial consequence of such compliance challenges.",

Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.\n\n## Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\n\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business operations negatively. For  example,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  other  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations  prohibit  us  from engaging  in  certain  business  practices.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  employees,  contractors,  suppliers,  or agents  will  not  violate  policies,  controls,  and  procedures  that  we  have  designed  to  help  ensure  compliance  with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or  our  employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws,  rules  and  regulations  be  amended  or  expanded,  or  new  ones  enacted,  we  could  incur  materially  greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative  rule  making,  and  enforcement  activity  resulting  from  growing  public  concern  over  concentration  of economic power in corporations.\n\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such  as  tariffs,  import  or  export  regulations,  including  deemed  export  restrictions,  trade  and  economic  sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce's U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally  fulfill  our  contractual  obligations  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business.  For  example,  in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions or export control measures, which have and could in the  future  result  in,  among  other  things,  severe  or  complete  restrictions  on  exports  to  and  other  commerce  and business dealings involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular entities and individuals. Such actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products, services and support into Russia  or  other  regions  determined  to  be  supporting  Russia,  and  restrict  access  by  our  Russian  or  Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our systems, negatively impacting productivity. Given these  recent  sanctions  and  export  restrictions  imposed  by  the  United  States  and  foreign  government  bodies,  we recently ceased product sales to Russia. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions  and  trade  restrictions,  our  employees,  contractors,  partners,  and  agents  may  take  actions  in  violations  of such  policies  and  applicable  law,  for  which  we  may  be  ultimately  held  responsible.  If  we  were  ever  found  to  have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\nGeopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export controls, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact  our  operating  strategies,  product  demand,  access  to  global  markets,  hiring,  and  profitability.  The  increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target products",

If enacted, these proposals would materially increase the level of income tax on our international profits.\n\nOur future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase if any of the foregoing potential tax changes are implemented or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  fluctuations  in  our  stock  price  and  level  of  stock-based  compensation  expense, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.\n\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges.  Any  such  violations  could  result  in  prohibitions  on  our  ability  to  offer  our  products  and  services  in  one  or  more countries,  could  delay  or  prevent  potential  acquisitions  and  could  also  materially  damage  our  reputation,  our  brand,  our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. These laws can require  suspension  or  termination  of  business,  including  financial  transactions,  in  certain  countries,  territories  or  with  certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example,  in  response  to  the  current  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  have  announced  extensive  sanctions against Russia and could impose broader sanctions or take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Oracle recorded fiscal 2022 revenues of $248 million from these two countries, a reduction of $118 million relative to fiscal 2021. No revenues are expected to be recognized from these two countries prospectively. Compliance with these laws also requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management's attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate  allegations  of  improprieties  relating  to  transactions  and  the  way  in  which  such  transactions  are  recorded.  Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information. No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.\n\nWe are  also  subject  to  a  variety  of  other  risks  and  challenges  in  managing  an  organization  operating  globally,  including  those related to:\n\n- general economic conditions in each country or region;\n- political  unrest,  terrorism,  war  and  the  potential  for  other  hostilities,  including  but  not  limited  to,  the  current  RussiaUkraine  conflict,  the  economic  impact  thereof  and  the  potential  to  subject  our  business  to  materially  adverse consequences  should  the  situation  escalate  beyond  its  current  scope,  including,  among  other  potential  impacts,  the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the rest of Europe, where a material portion of our business is carried out;\n- public  health  risks,  social  risks  and  supporting  infrastructure  stability  risks,  particularly  in  areas  in  which  we  have significant operations;",

      "answer": "IBM faces currency risks that could impact its revenue and business due to its significant international operations and the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve counterparty risk. Oracle, on the other hand, actively manages its foreign currency transaction risks using foreign currency forward contracts to offset potential volatility, with realized gains or losses included in non-operating expenses or income.

      "answer": "IBM explicitly states that it could be impacted by compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements as part of broader regulatory risks, which may affect its operations and growth objectives. Oracle, on the other hand, highlights that compliance with international data privacy requirements increases its cost of doing business and could lead to enforcement actions, reputational damage, and prohibitions on offering products in certain jurisdictions. While IBM focuses on how data privacy regulations could hinder operational agility and growth, Oracle emphasizes the financial penalties, legal risks, and reputational consequences tied to non-compliance.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - IBM mentions being impacted by compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements as part of broader regulatory risks that may affect its operations and growth objectives.",

      "question": "How does IBM's risk of human error in internal controls relate to Oracle's design focus on reducing human error in Oracle Autonomous Database, and what financial or operational benefits does Oracle claim its automation provides in response to such risks?",
      "answer": "Oracle claims that its Autonomous Database is engineered to lower labor costs and reduce human error through automation of routine database administration tasks such as maintenance, tuning, patching, scaling, security, and backup. This automation is supported by machine learning-driven diagnostics for fault prediction and error handling. In contrast, IBM acknowledges that human error is a risk within its internal controls, which could lead to misstatements or failure in financial reporting. Oracle's design directly addresses this risk by minimizing manual intervention, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood of errors that could impact financial and operational outcomes. While no specific dollar figure is cited for Oracle's cost savings, the document emphasizes consumption-based pricing and on-demand scaling as mechanisms to lower costs, paying only for resources used.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, IBM identifies 'human error' as a risk factor that could impact its internal controls and financial reporting.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Oracle explicitly states that its Autonomous Database is designed to 'lower labor costs and reduce human error' through automation and machine learning.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that Oracle's Autonomous Database addresses a risk factor IBM explicitly acknowledges, creating a direct thematic and functional connection between the two companies' 10-K disclosures."

      "question": "How does Adobe's investment strategy in applications and tools development compare with Qualcomm's strategic focus on expanding technologies into new industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, based on their respective risk and opportunity disclosures?",
      "answer": "Adobe emphasizes the importance of investments in research and development, particularly in recruiting software developers, to maintain competitiveness and support the timely development of new and enhanced offerings, including applications and tools. This reflects a strategy centered on innovation in software solutions to capitalize on long-term market opportunities. Qualcomm, on the other hand, highlights its focus on extending technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, industries, and applications beyond mobile handsets. Qualcomm acknowledges significant risks associated with these efforts, including the potential for high costs, failure to realize anticipated benefits, and challenges in integrating acquisitions. While both companies prioritize innovation and expansion, Adobe\u2019s strategy is more internally focused on developing competitive software offerings, whereas Qualcomm\u2019s approach involves higher risk through external strategic investments and acquisitions to drive growth in new markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Adobe\u2019s investment in R&D, including recruiting software developers, is critical to remaining competitive and developing new offerings, applications, and tools.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Qualcomm focuses on expanding technologies into new industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, involving acquisitions and strategic investments, which carry risks such as high costs and failure to achieve expected benefits.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies prioritize innovation, but Adobe focuses on internal R&D for software applications, while Qualcomm pursues external strategic investments with higher risk to expand into new markets."

We routinely acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and for industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not be successful, generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership or variable interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.\n\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, and we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.\n\nIf we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.\n\nMany of our acquisitions and other strategic investments require approval by the United States and/or foreign government agencies. Certain agencies in the past have, and may in the future, deny the transaction or fail to approve in a timely manner, resulting in us not realizing the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction. Future acquisitions or other strategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisitions has been or is in the future harmed. Further, if U.S./China relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency(ies) in China may be severely impacted. In addition, acquisitions that we have completed could subsequently be reviewed and/or challenged by government agencies, which could result in fines, penalties or other liability, or requirements to divest all or a portion of an acquired business.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\n\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nWe primarily utilize a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF (radio frequency) filter products, we rely on third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. There are a limited number of such third-party suppliers, and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology nodes or who are willing to operate at older process technology nodes necessary for certain of our integrated circuit products.

Adobe's deferred compensation plan assets are entirely classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, indicating they are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, we designated $235 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, of foreign currency-denominated liabilities, excluding accrued interest, related to the fine(s) imposed by the European Commission as hedges of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiary(ies). Gains and losses arising from the portion of these balances that are designated as net investment hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation adjustments. During fiscal 2022, we discontinued the net investment hedge related to one of the fines previously recorded related to the European Commission (EC) Investigation (Note 7). The associated foreign currency gains related to this fine previously recorded will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point it will be reclassified into earnings.\n\nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n\n- Level 1 includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active markets.\n- Level 2 includes financial instruments for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the instrument.\n- Level 3 includes financial instruments for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including our own assumptions.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. We recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal month in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer to occur.\n\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: We obtain pricing information from quoted market prices, pricing vendors or quotes from brokers/dealers. We conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendors to determine whether the inputs used in the vendor's pricing processes are deemed to be observable. Contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring the fair value of marketable equity securities. The fair value for interest-bearing securities includes accrued interest. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes and common stock is generally determined using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, quoted market prices, matrix pricing, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets and/or benchmark securities. The fair value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities is derived from the use of matrix pricing (prices for similar securities) or, in some cases, cash flow pricing models with observable inputs, such as contractual terms, maturity, credit rating and/or securitization structure to determine the timing and amount of future cash flows.\n\nDerivative Instruments: Derivative instruments that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market prices and are included in Level 1. Derivative instruments that are not traded on an exchange are valued using conventional calculations/models that are primarily based on observable inputs, such as foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rates, and therefore, such derivative instruments are included in Level 2.\n\nOther Investments and Other Liabilities: Other investments and other liabilities included in Level 1 are comprised of our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets, which consist of mutual funds and are included in other current assets and other assets. Gains and losses on the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan assets are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. Corresponding offsetting amounts related to the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities are included in operating expenses. Other investments included in Level 3 are comprised of contingently issuable equity instruments and warrants issued in connection with certain mergers and initial public offerings of",

      "answer": "Adobe reports $151 million in deferred compensation plan assets classified entirely in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, indicating they use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Qualcomm reports its deferred compensation plan liabilities are also classified in Level 1, but does not disclose the exact dollar amount in the provided evidence. Adobe provides a specific figure for its related assets while Qualcomm focuses on the valuation methodology without quantifying the liability, revealing different levels of disclosure granularity despite similar classification approaches.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Adobe's 10-K, identify the specific amount of $151 million for deferred compensation plan assets and their Level 1 classification.",
        "Step 2: From Qualcomm's 10-K, note the Level 1 classification for deferred compensation plan liabilities but observe that no specific dollar amount is disclosed.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two approaches, noting that while both companies use Level 1 for deferred compensation plans, only Adobe provides a quantified figure, highlighting differences in disclosure practices."

          "chunk_text": "\nOther Hedging Activities. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, we designated $235 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, of foreign currency-denominated liabilities, excluding accrued interest, related to the fine(s) imposed by the European Commission as hedges of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiary(ies). Gains and losses arising from the portion of these balances that are designated as net investment hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation adjustments. During fiscal 2022, we discontinued the net investment hedge related to one of the fines previously recorded related to the European Commission (EC) Investigation (Note 7). The associated foreign currency gains related to this fine previously recorded will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point it will be reclassified into earnings.\n\nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n\n- Level 1 includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active markets.\n- Level 2 includes financial instruments for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the instrument.\n- Level 3 includes financial instruments for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including our own assumptions.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. We recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal month in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer to occur.\n\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: We obtain pricing information from quoted market prices, pricing vendors or quotes from brokers/dealers. We conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendors to determine whether the inputs used in the vendor's pricing processes are deemed to be observable. Contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring the fair value of marketable equity securities. The fair value for interest-bearing securities includes accrued interest. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes and common stock is generally determined using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, quoted market prices, matrix pricing, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets and/or benchmark securities. The fair value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities is derived from the use of matrix pricing (prices for similar securities) or, in some cases, cash flow pricing models with observable inputs, such as contractual terms, maturity, credit rating and/or securitization structure to determine the timing and amount of future cash flows.\n\nDerivative Instruments: Derivative instruments that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market prices and are included in Level 1. Derivative instruments that are not traded on an exchange are valued using conventional calculations/models that are primarily based on observable inputs, such as foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rates, and therefore, such derivative instruments are included in Level 2.\n\nOther Investments and Other Liabilities: Other investments and other liabilities included in Level 1 are comprised of our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets, which consist of mutual funds and are included in other current assets and other assets. Gains and losses on the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan assets are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. Corresponding offsetting amounts related to the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities are included in operating expenses. Other investments included in Level 3 are comprised of contingently issuable equity instruments and warrants issued in connection with certain mergers and initial public offerings of",

Our one technology roadmap delivers the latest network technologies across multiple product tiers and devices. This roadmap is the result of extensive collaboration with manufacturers, operators, developers, systems integrators, cloud providers, tool vendors, service providers, governments and industry standards organizations, as well as our years of research into emerging network standards and the development of integrated circuits. Our roadmap takes advantage of new standards, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing standards. We have leveraged and expect to continue to leverage the foundational technologies initially developed and commercialized for use in mobile handset devices, such as our core baseband modem and processor technologies and our other wireless connectivity products including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning technologies, to extend into product categories, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT (which includes the industries and applications of consumer, industrial and edge networking).\n\nThe Snapdragon family of highly integrated, system-based solutions include the Snapdragon mobile, compute, sound and automotive platforms. Each platform consists of application processors and wireless connectivity capabilities, including our cellular modem that provides core baseband modem functionality for voice and data communications, non-cellular wireless connectivity (such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) and global positioning functions. Our Snapdragon application processor functions include CPU, security, graphics, display, audio, video, camera and AI. Our CPUs are designed to deliver high levels of compute performance with optimized power consumption. Our Qualcomm Hexagon\u2122 processors are designed to support a variety of signal processing applications, including AI, audio and sensor processing. Our Qualcomm Adreno\u2122 graphics processing units are designed to deliver high quality graphics performance for visually rich 3D gaming and user interfaces. In addition to the highly integrated core SoC, we also design and supply supporting components, including the RF transceiver, PM (power management), audio, codecs, speaker amps and additional wireless connectivity integrated circuits. These supporting components, in addition to our cellular modems and application processors comprising our core SoC, are also sold as individual components. The combination of the Snapdragon SoC, system software and supporting components provide an overall platform with optimized performance and efficiency, enabling manufacturers to design and deliver powerful, slim and power-efficient devices ready for integration with the complex cellular networks worldwide. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOur portfolio of RF products includes Qualcomm RFFE components that are designed to simplify the RF design for 5G frontend, LTE multimode and multiband mobile devices, including sub-6 GHz and mmWave devices, to reduce power consumption and to improve radio performance. We provide comprehensive RFFE product offerings with system level performance from the modem and transceiver to the antenna that include complex 4G/5G transmit and receive modules, power tracking, tuning systems, multimode-multiband power amplification, low noise amplifiers and mmWave antenna solutions, in addition to discrete filtering products, for devices and applications across the mobile handsets, automotive and IoT industries.

These products help enable home and business networks to support the growing number of connected devices, digital media and data services.\n\nOther than for certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products, QCT utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Therefore, we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers also are responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. The semiconductor package supports the electrical contacts that connect the integrated circuit to a circuit board. Die cut from silicon wafers are the essential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third parties for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements. The primary foundry suppliers for our various digital, analog/mixed-signal, RF and PM integrated circuits are Global Foundries, Samsung Electronics, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Our primary semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Amkor Technology, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATSChipPAC. The majority of our foundry and semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are located in the Asia-Pacific region.",

We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

          "chunk_text": "products in a broad range of devices, from low-tier, entry-level devices primarily for emerging regions to premium-tier devices, including but not limited to mobile devices, wireless networks, devices used in IoT, broadband gateway equipment, consumer electronic devices and automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and advanced driver assistance and automated driving. Our one technology roadmap delivers the latest network technologies across multiple product tiers and devices. This roadmap is the result of extensive collaboration with manufacturers, operators, developers, systems integrators, cloud providers, tool vendors, service providers, governments and industry standards organizations, as well as our years of research into emerging network standards and the development of integrated circuits. Our roadmap takes advantage of new standards, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing standards. We have leveraged and expect to continue to leverage the foundational technologies initially developed and commercialized for use in mobile handset devices, such as our core baseband modem and processor technologies and our other wireless connectivity products including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning technologies, to extend into product categories, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT (which includes the industries and applications of consumer, industrial and edge networking).\n\nThe Snapdragon family of highly integrated, system-based solutions include the Snapdragon mobile, compute, sound and automotive platforms. Each platform consists of application processors and wireless connectivity capabilities, including our cellular modem that provides core baseband modem functionality for voice and data communications, non-cellular wireless connectivity (such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) and global positioning functions. Our Snapdragon application processor functions include CPU, security, graphics, display, audio, video, camera and AI. Our CPUs are designed to deliver high levels of compute performance with optimized power consumption. Our Qualcomm Hexagon\u2122 processors are designed to support a variety of signal processing applications, including AI, audio and sensor processing. Our Qualcomm Adreno\u2122 graphics processing units are designed to deliver high quality graphics performance for visually rich 3D gaming and user interfaces. In addition to the highly integrated core SoC, we also design and supply supporting components, including the RF transceiver, PM (power management), audio, codecs, speaker amps and additional wireless connectivity integrated circuits. These supporting components, in addition to our cellular modems and application processors comprising our core SoC, are also sold as individual components. The combination of the Snapdragon SoC, system software and supporting components provide an overall platform with optimized performance and efficiency, enabling manufacturers to design and deliver powerful, slim and power-efficient devices ready for integration with the complex cellular networks worldwide. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOur portfolio of RF products includes Qualcomm RFFE components that are designed to simplify the RF design for 5G frontend, LTE multimode and multiband mobile devices, including sub-6 GHz and mmWave devices, to reduce power consumption and to improve radio performance. We provide comprehensive RFFE product offerings with system level performance from the modem and transceiver to the antenna that include complex 4G/5G transmit and receive modules, power tracking, tuning systems, multimode-multiband power amplification, low noise amplifiers and mmWave antenna solutions, in addition to discrete filtering products, for devices and applications across the mobile handsets, automotive and IoT industries.

These products help enable home and business networks to support the growing number of connected devices, digital media and data services.\n\nOther than for certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products, QCT utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Therefore, we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers also are responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. The semiconductor package supports the electrical contacts that connect the integrated circuit to a circuit board. Die cut from silicon wafers are the essential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third parties for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements. The primary foundry suppliers for our various digital, analog/mixed-signal, RF and PM integrated circuits are Global Foundries, Samsung Electronics, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Our primary semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Amkor Technology, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATSChipPAC. The majority of our foundry and semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are located in the Asia-Pacific region.",

      "answer": "Adobe's revenue recognition model includes perpetual software licenses as part of its diverse offerings, allowing enterprise customers to purchase either cloud subscriptions or perpetual licenses, which influences how revenue is recognized over time or upfront. Microsoft's volume licensing programs, such as Enterprise Agreements and Microsoft Products and Services Agreements, give large organizations the flexibility to purchase perpetual licenses (often with Software Assurance) or cloud subscriptions under one agreement. Together, these approaches enable organizations to strategically manage software acquisition by balancing long-term ownership through perpetual licenses with scalable cloud solutions across both Adobe and Microsoft.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Adobe's revenue is derived from 'term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses' and includes them in contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Microsoft offers volume licensing programs like Enterprise Agreements and Microsoft Products and Services Agreements that allow organizations to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to cloud services.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Adobe and Microsoft provide perpetual licensing options within broader enterprise licensing frameworks, enabling organizations to strategically manage software acquisition across both vendors."

      "answer": "Adobe's 2023 R&D section highlights their investment in the 'next generation of AI, machine learning, and deep learning-driven tools and features' aimed at solving problems in content understanding and generation, recommendations, and personalization. These efforts are part of Adobe's broader strategy to enhance their Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud offerings through cutting-edge AI technologies. In contrast, Microsoft's 2023 filing emphasizes AI tools in two specific business units: Office Consumer, where AI features are added to increase personal productivity and creativity, and LinkedIn, where AI-enabled insights and services are used to improve talent solutions, marketing, and sales offerings. While Adobe focuses on content and experience-driven AI tools, Microsoft integrates AI to boost productivity and professional networking outcomes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Adobe's R&D section explicitly mentions investment in AI, machine learning, and deep learning-driven tools to enhance Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud offerings.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Microsoft highlights AI tools in two business units: Office Consumer (for productivity and creativity) and LinkedIn (for AI-enabled insights and productivity solutions like Talent and Sales Solutions).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Adobe and Microsoft are investing in AI tools, but their strategic applications differ: Adobe focuses on content and digital experience enhancement, while Microsoft integrates AI into productivity and professional networking platforms."

Microsoft targets SMBs through Dynamics 365, a unified cloud-based platform offering ERP, CRM, and AI solutions, with revenue driven by user licenses and application consumption.

Apple specifically notes that complying with emerging and changing requirements causes substantial costs and may require changes to its business practices. IBM highlights that the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations globally will result in increased compliance costs, which could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing or maintaining offerings to market. Together, these disclosures suggest that both companies may face margin pressure, reduced operational efficiency, and potential limitations on international growth due to the complexity and cost of complying with inconsistent regulatory frameworks.",

      "question": "How does Apple's portfolio of subscription-based services contrast with Salesforce's transition strategy in shifting customers from term software licenses to subscription-based services, and what financial impact is Salesforce projecting from this shift?",
      "answer": "Apple already operates multiple established subscription-based services such as Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, and Apple TV+, which are designed to provide recurring revenue streams. In contrast, Salesforce is in the process of transitioning its Integration and Analytics offering from term software licenses to subscription-based services. Salesforce projects that this shift will result in less revenue recognized upfront in the period of transition, as revenue will now be recognized ratably over the contract term rather than at a point in time. However, it expects potentially increasing revenues over the remaining contract term due to the recurring nature of subscription revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Apple offers several subscription-based services including Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, and Apple TV+.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Salesforce is transitioning its Integration and Analytics offering from term software licenses to subscription-based services.",
        "Step 3: Extract financial impact from evidence_source_b - Salesforce expects less revenue in the transition period but potentially increasing revenues over the remaining contract term due to ratable recognition.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Apple already leverages subscription-based services for recurring revenue, while Salesforce is actively shifting its model, projecting a short-term revenue dip with long-term gains."

      "answer": "Apple's indemnification provisions expose the company to specific risks related to patent litigation involving its cellular-enabled products, with potential outcomes including significant monetary damages, injunctive relief, and changes to business practices that could materially affect its operations. The company faces an increasing number of such claims, which could lead to higher operating expenses and limitations on product offerings. In contrast, Salesforce's indemnification provisions are tied to its enterprise cloud computing services and primarily cover liabilities arising from intellectual property infringement by its products or services. While Salesforce acknowledges these provisions exist, it has not incurred any material costs related to them to date, indicating lower immediate financial exposure compared to Apple's more active legal challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Apple faces increasing patent claims related to its cellular-enabled products, with potential outcomes including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and changes to business practices.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Salesforce includes indemnification provisions for intellectual property infringement related to its enterprise cloud computing services but has not incurred any material costs from them.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Apple's indemnification risks are tied to active litigation with tangible financial consequences, while Salesforce's provisions have not yet resulted in material liabilities, showing differing levels of financial risk exposure."

      "answer": "AMD depends on ODMs to manufacture custom servers and hardware for hyperscale data centers, which are critical to its data center-focused product strategy. IBM, on the other hand, competes in the hybrid cloud infrastructure market against ODMs who rebrand and sell systems. IBM emphasizes differentiation through higher-value capabilities like security and scalability, which are also key factors in AMD's competitiveness. This creates a potential conflict in market positioning, as AMD relies on ODMs to deliver products that must meet the same high standards of performance and security that IBM is marketing as its competitive advantage.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial and consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

Our  technologies  adv ance  the  future  of  data  centers,  powering  the  cloud  serv ices  that  hav e  become  an  essential  part  of  how  we  work,  game,  and connect  to  network,  PCs,  edge  computing,  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  We  driv e  innov ation  through  high-performance  and  adaptiv e  computing technology, software and product leadership.\n\nWith our high-performance product portfolios, we deliv er differentiated solutions, such as our semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoCs), Adaptiv e SoCs, and accelerated processing units (APUs), and platform lev el client computing dev ices, embedded platforms and serv ers for our customers. We offer a deep portfolio of data center computing solutions including AI accelerators, microprocessors (CPUs), graphic processing units (GPUs), data processing units (DPUs),  Smart  Network  Interface  Cards  (SmartNICs),  and  field  programmable  gate  arrays  (FPGAs),  to  meet  the  v ast  computing  performance requirements  of  today's  data  centers,  supercomputers, AI  and  Machine  Learning  (ML)  data  center  env ironments  and  cloud  env ironments.  We  driv e innov ation  with  our  line-up  of  CPUs, APUs  and  chipsets  for  desktops  and  notebooks,  to  bring  performance,  efficiency, AI  capabilities  and  modern security features to gamers, creators, consumers and enterprises. AMD was the first company to integrate a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) on the same SoC as an x86 CPU for AI PCs. Our GPUs, including discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services, work together with software to power immersiv e gaming experiences for PCs, game consoles and cloud gaming serv ices. We are a leader in embedded computing, where we deliv er high-performance and scalability across a full portfolio of CPUs, APUs, FPGAs, system on modules (SOMs) and Adaptiv e SoCs that are  used  in  a  v ariety  of  markets,  including  automotiv e,  industrial,  healthcare,  storage  and  networking.  We  also  incorporate  dedicated AI  processing capabilities into our embedded portfolio.\n\nWe  develop  world-class  software  stacks  that  are  used  to  enable  our  high-performance  products.  Our  software  stacks  include  dev elopment  tools, compilers, and driv ers for our CPUs, APUs, GPUs and FPGAs. We work closely with our customers to define and dev elop customized solutions to precisely match their requirements. We enable this by combining our broad portfolio of high-performance IP with our leadership design and packaging to deliv er world-class customized solutions to our customers. We inv est in innov ativ e technology and solutions such as our custom-ready chiplet platform and AMD Infinity Architecture to maintain our leadership position as a custom-design silicon prov ider of choice.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nWe believe that AI is defining the next era of computing and that the full potential of AI will be realized when the technology is perv asiv e across cloud, edge and end devices. We believ e AMD has the compute engines, intellectual property, software capabilities and expertise to be a leader in this next computing era with a broad, portfolio of high-performance compute engines spanning across supercomputing, cloud, edge, embedded and end dev ices. We believe we hav e a unique opportunity to make AMD the end-to-end AI leader based on the breadth of our technology and product portfolios.\n\nOur AI strategy is focused on three priorities. T he first is deliv ering a broad portfolio of high-performance adaptiv e hardware and software solutions. T he second is expanding the deep and collaborativ e partnerships we hav e established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD based AI solutions at scale. And the third is prov iding compelling user experiences to extend the open and prov en software platform we hav e established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed more broadly and easily.\n\nOne of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our Data Center segment. The demand for our data center AI accelerator products was v ery strong as large hyperscaler customers, OEMs and ODMs deployed our AMD Instinct\u2122 MI300X  GPUs. During the year, we announced that we have accelerated our AMD AI accelerator roadmap to deliv er an annual cadence of leadership AMD  Instinct solutions.  We announced our 5th  Gen AMD EPYC\u2122 family of server processors, prov iding leadership performance and capabilities for a wide range of data center workloads.\n\nDuring the year, we completed the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI expanded our capability to accelerate dev elopment and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has also dev eloped a software stack used to train multiple state-of-theart large language models (LLMs) on AMD Instinct accelerators that can accelerate the dev elopment of highly-performant AMD training solutions.",

We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, new and ev olv ing industry standards, changing customer preferences and requirements, and frequent introductions by our competitors  or  new  competitors  of  products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance/experience  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our products comparativ ely less competitiv e.\n\nIn addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies.  For  example,  the AI  market  is  subject  to  rapid  technological  change,  product  obsolescence,  frequent  new  product  introductions  and feature enhancements, changes in end-user requirements and ev olv ing industry trends and legal standards. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete  successfully  against  current  or  new  competitors  who  may  hav e  stronger  positions  in  these  new  markets  or  superior  ability  to  anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. While we see significant opportunity in AI, we expect intense competition from companies such as Nvidia in the supply of GPUs and other accelerators for the AI market. We may face competition from some of our customers who internally dev elop the same products as us. Increased adoption of Arm-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and dev elopment of the Arm ecosystem. We may also face delays or disruptions in research and dev elopment efforts, or we may be required to inv est significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. In addition, the semiconductor industry has seen sev eral mergers and acquisitions ov er the last number of years. Further consolidation could adv ersely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry.",

Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate.  We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or  whenever  events  or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&amp;D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, and international realignments. Our effective tax rate was 15.6%, 17.7%, and 18.4% in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax  outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in  which  such  determination  is  made.  The  provision  for  income  tax es  includes  the  impact  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are  considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\n\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. If we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreignderived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and amortization, and corporate alternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of ex penses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The OECD, an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes, including a Pillar Two framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction, and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.",

A s a result of our assessment in the third quarter of 2024, we determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recoverable based upon our three-year cumulative historical loss position as of the third quarter of 2024, largely resulting from the asset impairment and restructuring and other charges incurred during 2024.
