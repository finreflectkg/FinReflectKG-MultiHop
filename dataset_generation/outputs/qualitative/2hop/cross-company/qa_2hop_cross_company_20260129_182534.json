      "question": "How does the talc litigation exposure described in both CVS and Johnson & Johnson's 2023 10-K filings reflect different aspects of legal risk management, and what specific audit procedures did Johnson & Johnson undertake that CVS did not disclose in evaluating the potential financial impact of these claims?",
      "answer": "CVS discloses that it is a defendant in hundreds of litigation proceedings related to the sale of products containing talc, which could significantly affect its businesses, operating results, and financial condition. However, CVS does not provide specific audit procedures or financial estimates related to these claims. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson disclosed detailed audit procedures performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, including testing controls around loss probability assessment, reviewing settlement agreements, consulting with legal counsel, and evaluating disclosure sufficiency. These procedures indicate a structured financial and legal evaluation process that CVS did not explicitly reveal in its filing, suggesting differing levels of transparency and formalized risk quantification between the two companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CVS's 10-K, extract the mention of being a defendant in 'hundreds of litigation proceedings' related to talc products and the potential for significant adverse effects on business and financial condition.",
        "Step 2: From Johnson & Johnson's 10-K, extract the specific audit procedures performed regarding talc litigation, including controls testing, settlement agreement evaluation, legal counsel discussions, and disclosure assessments.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two disclosures to identify that while both companies face similar litigation risks, JNJ provides detailed financial audit procedures and controls, whereas CVS does not disclose such mechanisms.",
        "Step 4: Conclude that the question of legal risk management differs between the two firms, with JNJ showing a more structured and audited approach to evaluating and disclosing potential financial impacts."

      "question": "How does the Medicare Program's regulatory changes under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), specifically impacting JNJ's drug pricing strategy, compound the financial and operational risks faced by CVS through its Medicare-related business units such as Oak Street Health and Signify Health?",
      "answer": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which imposes government-established pricing on selected drugs like JNJ's XARELTO and STELARA in the Medicare program starting in 2026 and 2028, introduces significant uncertainty in JNJ's revenue projections and pricing strategies. This regulatory pressure could reduce JNJ's profitability on key products and increase exposure to penalties for non-compliance. Meanwhile, CVS faces operational and financial risks through its Medicare-related businesses, Oak Street Health and Signify Health, which rely heavily on Medicare reimbursements and are sensitive to changes in Medicare program rules. If the IRA leads to reduced provider reimbursements or tighter cost controls, Oak Street Health's capitated agreements and Signify Health's ACOs could face increased financial risk due to fixed-fee structures and potential underpayment if service costs exceed reimbursement rates. Therefore, the IRA's regulatory impact on JNJ's drug pricing strategy indirectly affects CVS's Medicare-linked operations by potentially altering the broader reimbursement environment and cost structures within which these units operate.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - JNJ's drugs XARELTO and STELARA are on the IRA's Selected Drug list, which subjects them to government-established pricing starting in 2026 (Part D) and 2028 (Part B).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - JNJ is challenging the IRA's constitutionality due to its impact on drug pricing and potential profitability.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - CVS's Oak Street Health and Signify Health businesses are heavily dependent on Medicare reimbursements and are subject to risks from changes in Medicare program rules.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The IRA's pricing controls on JNJ drugs could signal a broader shift in Medicare reimbursement policies, which may affect payment models used by CVS's Medicare-linked businesses, increasing their financial risk under fixed-fee arrangements."

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2023, there were 8 Physiomesh-related cases still pending in the MDL and New Jersey MCL combined (5 in MDL and 3 in MCL). These were not included in the master settlement agreement (MSA) entered in September 2021, which covered 3,729 cases.

      "question": "What was the total financial impact on both CVS and JNJ from talc-related litigation as disclosed in their respective 2023 10-K filings, and how did each company attempt to manage this liability?",
      "answer": "The total financial impact from talc-related litigation on both companies was approximately $2.5 billion for JNJ, as disclosed in the JNJ 2023 10-K filing, while CVS did not specify a dollar amount but acknowledged being a defendant in hundreds of litigation proceedings related to talc. JNJ attempted to manage the liability through a corporate restructuring in 2021, transferring all talc-related liabilities to a new subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to stay litigation and consolidate claims. CVS, on the other hand, indicated that its ability to manage such liabilities depends on insurance coverage and indemnification from third parties, which may not be sufficient to cover potential claims.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (CVS) - CVS is a defendant in hundreds of litigation proceedings relating to the sale of products containing talc, and the coverage available under its insurance programs and indemnification from third parties may not be adequate.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (JNJ) - JNJ paid approximately $2.5 billion related to the Ingham talc verdict, and implemented a 2021 corporate restructuring to isolate talc liabilities within LTL Management LLC, which subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face talc-related litigation, but their financial exposure and mitigation strategies differ: JNJ quantified its payout and used legal restructuring, while CVS emphasized insurance limitations without specifying costs."

      "question": "Considering the specific coverage limitations described in both Abbott's and Amgen's 2023 10-K filings, how do these regulatory pressures influence their respective pricing strategies in both U.S. and international markets?",
      "answer": "Abbott faces U.S. coverage limitations such as the DRG and PPS systems, which fix reimbursement based on diagnosis or procedure rather than actual costs, incentivizing healthcare facilities to limit expenditures on health care products. Additionally, the competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment, including diabetes products, and the federally funded WIC program's cost containment measures through competitive bidding and rebates further constrain Abbott\u2019s pricing power. These pressures lead Abbott to expect increasing challenges in maintaining pricing levels and higher rebate obligations. In contrast, Amgen is affected by U.S. state-level PDABs in Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington, which have authority to set upper payment limits on certain drugs, and by international price control mechanisms such as mandatory price controls, price referencing, and therapeutic-reference pricing in many countries. These international pressures, combined with health technology assessments that determine coverage and reimbursement based on cost-effectiveness, lead Amgen to focus on pricing that reflects product value, developing biosimilars for affordability, and engaging in risk-sharing partnerships with payers. Both companies are adapting to these regulatory constraints by adjusting pricing strategies and focusing on value-based pricing, rebate management, and alternative access models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott faces DRG and PPS systems that fix reimbursement based on diagnosis or procedure, and competitive bidding systems for diabetes products and WIC rebates.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face regulatory-driven coverage limitations that constrain pricing power in the U.S. and internationally, leading them to adopt different but related strategies to manage market access and pricing pressures."

      "answer": "ABT recognizes a $70 million gain in 2023 from foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedges, while its interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges that offset the effect of marking fixed-rate hedged debt to market. In contrast, AMGN experiences incomplete offsetting between gains on hedged items and losses on related hedging instruments due to the amortization of cumulative fair value hedging adjustments on hedged debt from discontinued hedging relationships, which increases earnings volatility. This means ABT's hedging strategy stabilizes earnings more directly, whereas AMGN faces greater earnings variability from its hedging approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - ABT reports that interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges, and the hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - AMGN reports that gains on hedged items do not completely offset losses on related hedging instruments due to amortization of fair value hedging adjustments on hedged debt from discontinued relationships.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - ABT\u2019s hedging strategy results in a more stable earnings impact due to full offsetting, while AMGN experiences earnings volatility because of incomplete offsetting from amortized hedging adjustments."

      "answer": "CVS faces product liability risks primarily through its proprietary brand retail products and pharmacy services, which could lead to adverse effects on customer loyalty, supplier relationships, and operating results. These risks are tied to supply chain disruptions, product recalls, and shifts in consumer preferences. In contrast, Medtronic (MDT) faces product liability risks due to the inherent dangers in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices, especially those used in intensive care or implanted in the body long-term. These risks could lead to recalls, lawsuits, reputational harm, and material adverse effects on MDT's business and financial condition. While both companies face product liability exposure, MDT's risks are more directly tied to patient safety outcomes and regulatory scrutiny, which could result in more severe financial and operational consequences such as exclusion from government reimbursement programs or costly settlements, compared to CVS's more market-driven risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (CVS) - CVS mentions that product liability risks from proprietary brand products and pharmacy services could adversely affect customer relationships, supplier relationships, and operating results due to supply chain disruptions, recalls, or shifts in consumer preferences.",

      "answer": "Amgen (AMGN) could face up to $8.7 billion in additional federal tax ($3.6 billion for 2010\u20132012 and $5.1 billion for 2013\u20132015) from unresolved IRS notices. This is significantly larger than Thermo Fisher\u2019s (TMO) 2024 decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to foreign tax positions, which amounted to $240 million due to the settlement of international audits for tax years 2009 through 2016. Both companies are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years ended on or before 2009 (AMGN) and 2018 (TMO), respectively, but the scale of AMGN\u2019s potential tax exposure far exceeds TMO\u2019s settled liabilities.",

Our income tax returns are routinely ex amined by tax authorities in those jurisdictions. Significant disputes can arise and have arisen with tax  authorities involving issues regarding the timing and amount of deductions, the use of tax credits and allocations of income and expenses among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws, regulations and relevant facts. Tax  authorities, including the IRS, are becoming more aggressive and are particularly focused on such matters.\n\nIn 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010-2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010-2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010-2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax  that could be imposed for the years 20102012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.\n\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013-2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010-2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013-2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013-2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax  that could be imposed for the years 2013-2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.\n\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in the U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022. The trial began on November 4, 2024 and concluded on January 17, 2025. With the conclusion of the trial, the parties will file post-trial briefs and make closing arguments in 2025. The Company expects a decision from the Tax Court no earlier than 2026.\n\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016-2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. We believe that the IRS may also seek to continue to audit similar issues related to the allocation of income between the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico for years beyond 2018. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.\n\nFinal resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the nex t 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax  law , application of the tax  law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax  authorities; however, due to the complex ity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years ended on or before December 31, 2009.",

Considering Amgen's stated dependency and Thermo Fisher's regulatory exposure, what would be the potential financial and operational impact on Amgen if Thermo Fisher failed a critical FDA inspection related to the production of materials used in Amgen's product supply chain?",
      "answer": "If Thermo Fisher failed a critical FDA inspection related to the production of materials used in Amgen's product supply chain, Amgen could face significant operational and financial disruptions. Amgen explicitly states that if its third-party contract manufacturers or service providers violate regulations, the FDA could mandate corrective actions, issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend, or revoke prior approvals, which could halt Amgen\u2019s ability to manufacture, conduct clinical trials, or sell products. Amgen further notes that alternative qualified third-party providers may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. Thermo Fisher's 10-K confirms its exposure to regulatory inspections and the potential consequences, including product recalls, monetary sanctions, injunctions, and withdrawal of approvals. A failure by Thermo Fisher could directly disrupt Amgen\u2019s supply chain, leading to delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs, and potentially a material adverse effect on Amgen\u2019s business and financial results, especially given Amgen\u2019s reliance on a small number of vendors and the lengthy time (up to three years) required to qualify a new contract manufacturer.",

It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant, and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes, or at all.\n\nWe are expanding our manufacturing capabilities to support current and anticipated demand for our products and product candidates. Our expansion efforts, in certain circumstances, rely on a single or small number of vendors or suppliers, and finding alternative suppliers may not be feasible or could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the requirements of our facilities. Construction or quality assurance challenges at the facilities we are building or expanding, labor shortages, contractual disputes with our suppliers, negative outcomes from agency officials or other delays or challenges in operationalizing additional manufacturing capacity could limit our ability to capitalize on demand for our products and product candidates.\n\nIn  addition,  regulatory  agencies  conduct routine monitoring and inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations, they may mandate corrective actions and/or issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls  of  our  products. Additionally,  we  distribute  a  substantial  volume  of  our  commercial  products  through  our  primary  distribution  centers  in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, labor unrest, natural disasters and geopolitical security threats.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations with respect to the use and/or presence of certain chemicals in our products or the components used in the research, development, manufacture and/or packaging of our products could also disrupt or restrict our ability to develop, produce or sell our products in the affected jurisdictions. For example, the  EU,  the  U.S.  Congress,  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection Agency,  and  several  U.S.  states  are  considering  legislation  and/or  policies  to  address  the  reporting, presence, and/or use, of certain chemicals in certain of the components used in the manufacture or packaging of commercial products, including chemicals known as perand  polyfluorinated  substances  (PFAS).  In  July  2024,  Canada  (through  Environment  and  Climate  Change  Canada)  issued  a  notice  requiring  reporting  on  PFAS manufacture, import, and use in Canada. In addition, proposed legislation in several jurisdictions are under consideration to prohibit or otherwise regulate the importation, manufacture, or distribution of goods containing PFAS, and some such proposals do not provide exemptions for drug products, medical devices, their packaging, or the materials used in the research, development, or manufacture of such products or devices. For example, the EU is considering a ban on PFAS in the manufacturing and packaging of pharmaceutical products that could affect pharmaceutical research and development activities and commercial distribution. Some proposals, if enacted without exemptions for pharmaceutical products, and materials used in their research, development, and manufacture, or without adequate time to research and develop or otherwise identify alternative materials or suppliers, may cause significant disruptions to our ability to manufacture and supply products to the affected jurisdictions, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.",

Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that ex plosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. In addition, patients involved in our clinical services trials conducted by our clinical development services business or taking drugs approved on the basis of those trials may also bring personal injury claims against us. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers' operators and the training of such operators.\n\nAny such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities subject to insurance policy exclusions where insurance would not respond or in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability and errors and omissions insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.\n\nWe are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.

In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of, the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.\n\nThe manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices, and our pharma and clinical development services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could ex pose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or personal injury, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers.\n\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, business partners or other third parties.

Therefore, results of our operations are reported on a consolidated basis for purposes of segment reporting, consistent with internal management reporting.\n\nThe human therapeutics segment is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing and delivery of innovative medicines to fight some of the world's toughest diseases.  The  Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer  has  been  identified  as  the  chief  operating  decision  maker  (CODM).  The  CODM  manages  and  allocates resources on a consolidated basis. The determination of a single segment is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of evaluating performance and allocating resources, which is reviewed on a consolidated basis.\n\nAs the Company's CODM evaluates the financial performance of the Company's human therapeutics segment on a consolidated basis, the measure of segment performance is net income, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The CODM uses net income to allocate resources on a consolidated basis, which enables the CODM to assess both the overall level of resources available and optimize distribution of resources across functions, therapeutic areas, regions and research and development programs in line with our long-term corporate-wide strategic goals. In addition, the CODM may also evaluate financial performance based on net income adjusted for certain items that are unusual and non-recurring. As the Company manages its assets on a consolidated basis, the measure of segment assets is total assets, as reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10, Investments, for further information regarding equity method investments, and Net cash used in investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further information regarding capital expenditures.",

      "answer": "The increased utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program negatively affects both J&J and Merck by reducing their revenues from drug sales. Specifically, Merck notes that this expanded use of the program, along with restrictions on identifying inappropriate discounts, is having a negative impact on company performance. Additionally, Merck highlights that government price setting under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which builds on the pricing pressures from the 340B Program, will affect key products such as Januvia (effective 2026), Janumet and Janumet XR (effective 2027), and Keytruda (effective 2028), leading to expected declines in U.S. sales for these products.",

        "Step 3: Extract specific financial impact from evidence_source_b - Merck identifies specific drugs (Januvia, Janumet, Janumet XR, Keytruda) that are subject to government price setting under the IRA, which compounds the negative impact of the 340B Program.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Both companies are negatively impacted by the 340B Program\u2019s pricing pressures, and Merck provides concrete examples of how this regulatory environment affects its revenue outlook for major products."

          "chunk_text": "Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company's intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party  and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.\n\n## Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.\n\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured - often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites - as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.\n\nThe industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\n\n## Global health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such incident(s), a health crisis or health crises). The spread of health crises have caused and may cause the Company to modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners under such circumstances. Impacts to the Company have included and may include adverse impacts to results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. While the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network designed to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected in the event of a health crisis. Health crises could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, thirdparty suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. A ny of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\n\n## Risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings\n\nGlobal sales in the Company's Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.\n\nSales of the Company's Innovative M edicine and M edTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payors such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of M edicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny on pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the Inflation Reduction A ct of 2022 (IRA ) has changed M edicare Part D benefit design and has subjected certain of the Company's products to governmentestablished pricing beginning in 2026 and may subject additional products in the future. Failure to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law pending ongoing litigation may expose the Company to penalties. In addition, change to M edicare Part D could have a negative impact on U.S. Innovative M edicine sales. Further, increased third-party utiliz ation of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program from expanded interpretations of the statute and program abuse may have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company's products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.\n\n## 10",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn  addressing global cost containment pressures, the  Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens' access to appropriate health care, including medicines.\n\nOperating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company's business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.\n\n## United States\n\nThe Company faces increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company's sales and profit margins, including, through (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to M edicare and M edicaid, including the M edicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization A ct of 2003, the Patient Protection and A ffordable Care A ct of 2010 (A CA ), the A merican Rescue Plan A ct of 2021 (A merican Rescue Plan A ct), and the Inflation Reduction A ct of 2022 (IRA ). A dditionally , increased utiliz ation of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program and restrictions on the Company's ability to identify  inappropriate discounts are having a negative impact on Company performance.\n\nIn the U.S., federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay . For example, federal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by M edicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain state and federal entities such as the Department of Defense, V eterans A ffairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.\n\nAdditionally in the U.S., consolidation and integration among health care entities is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products.  Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for M erck's products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been increasing the cost-sharing required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies, as well as governments, also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in  treatment  areas  in  which  the  payor  has  taken  the  position  that  multiple  branded  products  are  therapeutically  comparable.  A s  the  U.S.  payor  market concentrates further, the Company may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors.\n\n## Legislative Changes\n\nIn 2022, Congress passed the IRA , which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the M edicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the M edicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits, which has taken effect in 2025, and government price setting for certain M edicare Part D drugs, starting in 2026, and  M edicare  Part  B  drugs  starting  in  2028.  Government  price  setting  may  also  impact  pricing  in  the  private  market  negatively  affecting  the  Company's performance. In A ugust 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for M edicare &amp; M edicaid Services (CM S), selected Januvia for the first y ear of the IRA 's 'Drug Price Negotiation Program' (Program). Pursuant to the IRA 's Program, a government price was set for Januvia , which will become effective on January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS announced that Janumet and Janumet XR have been selected for government price setting, which will become effective on January 1, 2027. In addition, the Company expects that Keytruda will be selected in 2026 for government price setting, which would become effective on January 1, 2028 and the Company expects that, as a result, U.S. sales of Keytruda will decline after that time. The Company has sued the U.S.  government  regarding  the  IRA 's  Program  (see  Item  8  'Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,'  Note  10.  'Contingencies  and  Environmental Liabilities' below). Furthermore,",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson discloses that when a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted in Superfund proceedings, a liability is initially accrued based on estimated transaction costs to manage the site, and these accruals are adjusted as site investigations and feasibility studies progress. Merck similarly accounts for Superfund liabilities by initially accruing based on estimated remediation costs and adjusts as more information becomes available, including the extent to which other potentially responsible parties can contribute. Johnson & Johnson reported $225 million in legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2024, which includes costs related to environmental proceedings, while Merck capitalizes $412 million in inventories produced in preparation for product launches, which could be impacted by environmental liabilities if they affect production or regulatory compliance.",

Discovery is underway.\n\n## General litigation\n\nThe Company or its subsidiaries are also parties to various proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  A ct, commonly  known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the Company's agreement to implement remediation activities at designated hazardous waste sites or to reimburse the government or third parties for the costs they have incurred in performing remediation as such sites.\n\nIn October 2017, certain United States service members and their families brought a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries in United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the defendants violated the United States A nti-Terrorism A ct. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi M inistry of Health. In July 2020, the District Court dismissed the complaint. In January 2022, the United States Court of A ppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court's decision. In June 2023, defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. In June 2024, the Supreme Court vacated the D.C. Circuit's decision and remanded the case to the D.C. Circuit. Oral argument was held in November 2024.\n\nIn February 2024, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the Pension &amp; Benefits Committee of Johnson &amp; Johnson (Committee), and certain named officers and employees, in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In M ay 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the Company and the Committee. The complaint alleges that defendants breached fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by allegedly mismanaging the Company's prescription-drug benefits program. The complaint seeks damages and other relief. In January 2025, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss.\n\n## MedTech\n\nIn October 2020, Fortis A dvisors LLC (Fortis), in its capacity as representative of the former stockholders of A uris Health Inc. (A uris), filed a complaint against the Company, Ethicon Inc., and certain named officers and employees (collectively, Ethicon) in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The complaint alleges breach of contract, fraud, and other causes of action against Ethicon in connection with Ethicon's acquisition of A uris in 2019. The complaint seeks damages and other relief. In December 2021, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss certain causes of action. A ll claims against the individual defendants were dismissed. The trial occurred in January 2024. In September 2024, the court found liability with respect to certain claims and no liability  with respect to other claims. The Company has appealed the decision.\n\nIn October 2019, Innovative Health, LLC filed a complaint against Biosense Webster, Inc (BWI) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleges that certain of BWI's business practices and contractual terms violate the antitrust laws of the United States and the State of California by restricting competition in the sale of High Density M apping Catheters and Ultrasound Catheters. Trial is scheduled for A pril 2025.\n\n## Innovative Medicine\n\nIn June 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Civil Investigative Demand to the Company and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in connection with its investigation of whether Janssen's REM ICA DE contracting practices violate federal antitrust laws. The Company has produced documents and information responsive to the Civil Investigative Demand. Janssen is in ongoing discussions with the FTC staff regarding its inquiry.\n\nIn February 2022, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued Civil Investigative Demands to Johnson &amp; Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectiv ely , Janssen) in connection with its inv estigation of whether advertising practices for REM ICA DE violate federal law. Janssen has produced documents and information responsive to the Civil Investigative Demands. In January 2025, the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection informed Janssen that it was closing its investigation.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n103",

Outside of the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nMerck's payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are ty pically  30 day s from receipt of inv oice; howev er, certain products hav e longer pay ment terms, including Keytruda , which has payment terms of 90 days. Payment terms for vaccine sales in the U.S. typically range from 30 days to 60 days. Outside of the U.S., payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer payment terms.\n\nThrough its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. The terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. Information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns.\n\n## Inventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches\n\nThe Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Capitalization of such inventory does not begin until regulatory approval is considered by the Company to be probable. The Company monitors the status of each respective product during the research and regulatory approval process. If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety , efficacy , manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are capitaliz ed, anticipated future sales and shelf liv es support the realiz ation of the inv entory  v alue as the inv entory  shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $412 million and $790 million, respectively.\n\n## Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\n\nThe Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability , intellectual property , commercial litigation and securities litigation, as well as certain additional matters, including governmental and environmental matters (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. Generally , for product liability  claims, a portion of the ov erall accrual is actuarially  determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nLegal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $225 million and $210 million, respectively , represents the Company's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company . The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.\n\nThe  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  parties  to  a  number  of  proceedings  brought  under  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, Compensation and Liability A ct, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability  is initially  accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. A ccruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.",

A lliance rev enue is recorded net of cost of sales and includes an adjustment to share commercialization costs between the partners in accordance with the collaboration agreement. The adjustment is determined by comparing the commercialization costs M erck has incurred directly and reported within Selling, general and administrative expenses with the costs the collaborative partner has incurred. Research and development costs M erck incurs related to collaborations  are  recorded  within Research and development ex penses.  Cost reimbursements to the collaborative partner or payments received from the collaborative partner to share these costs pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreements are recorded as increases or decreases to Research and development expenses.\n\nIn  addition,  the  terms  of  the  collaboration  agreements  may  require  the  Company  to  make  payments  based  upon  the  achievement  of  certain developmental, regulatory approval or commercial milestones. Upfront and milestone payments payable by M erck to collaborative partners prior to regulatory approval are expensed as incurred and included in Research and development ex penses.  Payments due to collaborative partners upon or subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized to Cost of sales over the estimated useful life of the corresponding intangible asset, provided that future cash flows support the amounts capitalized. Sales-based milestones payable by M erck to collaborative partners are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined by the  Company to be probable of being achieved based on future sales forecasts.  The amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the first regulatory approval for products that were unapproved at the time the collaboration was formed or, for new indications of approved products, from the time of the formation of the collaboration. The related intangible asset that is recognized is amortized to Cost of sales ov er its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.\n\nShare-Based Compensation The Company expenses all share-based payments to employees over the requisite service period based on the grantdate fair v alue of the awards.\n\nRestructuring Costs The Company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. In accordance with existing benefit arrangements, future employee termination costs to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary separations are accrued when such separations are probable and estimable. When accruing these costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period.\n\nContingencies and Legal Defense Costs The Company records accruals for contingencies and legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\n\nTaxes on Income Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely  than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of Taxes on Income . The Company accounts for the tax effects of the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of certain foreign subsidiaries in the income tax provision in the period the tax arises. The Company's policy for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from AOCL is to utiliz e the item-by -item approach.\n\nReclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GA A P) and, accordingly , include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily IPR&amp;D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. A dditionally , estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts, rebates and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-",

(1)\n\n## Competition and the Health Care Environment\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company's competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company's operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the  Company's  products  mature,  as  well  as  technological  advances  of  competitors,  industry  consolidation,  patents  granted  to  competitors,  competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors' branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. A n adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products.\n\nPharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively . With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations, and has been refining its sales and marketing  efforts  to  address  changing  industry  conditions.  However,  the  introduction  of  new  products  and  processes  by  competitors  may  result  in  price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease ty pically  increases ov er time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales of the Company's products in that therapeutic category.\n\nThe highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company's products as well as competitors' products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.\n\n## Health Care Environment and Government Regulation\n\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of M edicare, M edicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company's sales performance in 2024 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. In the U.S., the Executive Branch and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect sales and profits.",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson faces potential revenue losses due to the risk of generic and biosimilar versions of its key pharmaceutical products entering the market if patent lawsuits are not successfully defended. This could also result in non-cash impairment charges for associated intangible assets. Additionally, J&J has accrued liabilities for legal contingencies related to ongoing litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flows in any given reporting period. Merck, similarly, faces revenue declines due to the early entry of generic and biosimilar products, especially following the loss of patent protection, and anticipates continued negative effects on sales and profits from global cost-containment efforts. Merck also notes the risk of new legislation accelerating generic approvals, which could further reduce its market share and revenues. Both companies face increased legal exposure and potential impairment charges due to these competitive pressures.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - Both companies face similar threats from generic and biosimilar competition, which could lead to revenue declines and increased legal exposure. Their disclosures indicate that these risks have a direct impact on financial projections, legal accruals, and potential impairment charges."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAs discussed above in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment,' global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide.  Changes to the  U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of M edicare, M edicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company's sales performance in 2024 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs, including in the U.S., the expansion of the Federal 340B Drug Discount Program. The Company anticipates all of these actions, and additional actions in the future, will continue to negatively affect sales and profits.\n\nIf credit and economic conditions worsen, the resulting economic and currency impacts in the affected markets and globally could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results.\n\n## The Company faces intense competition from both lower cost generic and biosimilar products and competitors' products.\n\nIn general, the Company faces increasing competition from lower-cost generic and biosimilar products. The patent rights that protect its products are of varying strengths and durations. In addition, in some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the U.S. or in the EU. In the U.S. and the EU, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures that encourage the use of generic and biosimilar products. Although it is the Company's policy to actively protect its patent rights, generic challenges to the Company's products can arise at any time, and the Company's patents may not prevent the emergence of generic competition for its products.\n\nLoss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic or biosimilar substitutes, reducing the Company's sales of that product. Availability  of generic substitutes for the Company's drugs may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the U.S. and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. A ny such proposal that is enacted into law could worsen this substantial negative effect on the Company's sales, business, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nAlso, the Company's products face intense competition from competitors' products. This competition may increase as new products enter the market. In such an event, the competitors' products may be safer or more effective, more convenient to use, have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels or be more effectively marketed and sold than the Company's products. A lternatively , in the case of generic competition, including the generic availability of competitors' branded products, they may be equally safe and effective products that are sold at a substantially lower price than the Company's products. A s a result, if the Company fails to maintain its competitive position, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively impact product cash flows, the Company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.\n\n## The Company has significant global operations, which expose it to additional risks, and any adverse event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe extent of the Company's operations outside the U.S. is significant. Risks inherent in conducting a global business include:\n\n- changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions in key markets;\n- multiple regulatory requirements that could restrict the Company's ability to manufacture and sell its products in key markets;\n- trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, including the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments;\n- foreign exchange fluctuations;\n- diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and\n- possible nationalization and expropriation.\n\nThe U.S. government has announced plans to significantly increase tariffs on foreign imports into the U.S., particularly from Canada and M exico and has already increased tariffs on imports from China.

For BMY, the total fair value is $424 million as of December 31, 2024, with a liability of $43 million. Combined, the fair value is $497 million with a total liability of $43 million.",

        "Step 1: From ABBV's evidence, extract the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges under the 2024 column, which is $73 million.",
        "Step 2: From BMY's evidence, extract the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges under December 31, 2024, which is $424 million.",
        "Step 3: From BMY's evidence, extract the liability value for foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges under December 31, 2024, which is $43 million.",
        "Step 4: Combine the fair values from ABBV and BMY to calculate the total fair value: $73 million (ABBV) + $424 million (BMY) = $497 million.",
        "Step 5: Since ABBV has no liability for this category, add BMY's liability of $43 million to determine the total liability for both companies."

For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n\n## Acquired IPR&amp;D and Milestones Expenses\n\nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&amp;D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&amp;D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed i n certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&amp;D as incurred.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include j oi nt research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022.\n\n## 57 | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "The FDA-mandated addition of a 'boxed warning' about T-cell malignancies to CAR-T cell therapies in January 2024 negatively affects BMY's product labeling, market acceptance, and revenue potential. This regulatory change may narrow approved indications and reduce the patient population eligible for treatment, directly impacting BMY's operating results. Meanwhile, AbbVie, which derives approximately 24% of its net revenues from international markets, faces additional risks if similar labeling changes lead to stricter regulatory actions or reimbursement limitations abroad. The combination of domestic labeling changes and AbbVie's global exposure heightens the risk that both companies will experience declining revenues, reduced formulary listings, and increased legal exposure, thereby negatively affecting their commercial strategies and financial outlooks.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - The FDA-mandated label change impacts BMY directly by reducing product viability and revenue, while AbbVie's international exposure increases its vulnerability to similar regulatory actions abroad, creating a dual negative impact on both companies' commercial strategies and financial performance."

Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 24% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2024. The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include:\n\n- fl uctuations in currency exchange rates;\n- changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions;\n- multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products;\n- differing local product preferences and product requirements;\n- trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n- i nternational trade disruptions or disputes;\n- difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations;\n- differing labor regulations;\n- potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n- political and economic instability;\n- conflicts or crises in individual countries or regions, including terrorist activities or wars;\n- sovereign debt issues;\n- price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and regulation;\n- i nfl ati on, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;\n- restrictions on transfers of funds;\n- potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries; and\n- potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act.\n\n## If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nAbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\n\nAbbVie from time to time pursues acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, and/or disposes of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities.

          "chunk_text": "over longer periods of time and studies that identify biomarkers (objective characteristics that can indicate a particular response to a product or therapy) that are conducted after obtaining marketing approval for our products, and regulatory changes to standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining revenues. Sometimes additional information from new studies identifies a portion of the patient population that may be non-responsive to a medicine or would be at higher risk of adverse reactions and labeling changes based on such studies may limit the patient population. The studies providing such additional information may be sponsored by us, but they could  also  be  sponsored  by  competitors,  insurance  companies,  government  institutions,  MCOs,  scientists,  investigators  or  other  interested  parties.  While additional safety and efficacy information from such studies assist us and healthcare providers in identifying the best patient population for each product, it can also negatively impact our operating results. New information added to a product' s label can affect its risk-benefit profile, leading to potential voluntary or mandatory recalls, withdrawals or declining revenue, as well as legal claims, including product liability, consumer fraud or other claims.  For example, in November 2023, the FDA announced that it was investigating the risk of T-cell malignancies in patients who received treatment with CAR-T cell therapy, noting that the overall benefits of CAR-T cell therapy products continue to outweigh their potential risks for their approved uses. In January 2024, the FDA determined that safety labeling changes were needed for approved CAR-T cell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR-T cell therapy. Additionally, certain study results, especially from head-to-head studies, could affect a product' s formulary listing, which could also adversely affect revenues.\n\nIn addition, if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a third party's product in the same class as one of our products, those concerns could implicate the entire class and this, in turn, could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as other products in the class.\n\n## The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or unregistered versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.\n\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit drug or a product diverted from its authorized market may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name or diverted products. The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-commerce, greatly enhancing consumers' ability to obtain prescriptions and other medical treatments via the internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacies. The internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams because of the anonymity it affords counterfeiters.\n\nThefts  of  inventory  at  warehouses,  plants  or  while  in-transit,  which  are  then  not  properly  stored  and  are  later  sold  through  unauthorized  channels,  could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. In addition, diversion of products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\n\n## Use of social media platforms can present risks and challenges.\n\nWe use social media to communicate Company news and events.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates accrued for pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish the rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based on estimates and assumptions, including the determination of the related payer of the rebate based on sales trends, changes in rebate contracts which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms, and the corresponding lag in payment timing.\n\nAuditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs, contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. Specifically, we tested management's controls to evaluate the sufficiency of its reserve estimates by comparing to actual rebates paid, controls over rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test the sales rebate accruals and assess the historical accuracy of management's estimate for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs, our audit procedures included independently calculating the sales rebate accruals based on historical payments and performing a hindsight analysis on the reserves recorded. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroborating management's estimate of the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company's calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

A large portion of these accruals are rebates associated with sales in the United States for which payment for purchase of the product is cov ered by Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare.\n\nAuditing the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate and discount liabilities is challenging because of the subjectiv ity of certain assumptions required to estimate the rebate liabilities. In calculating the appropriate accrual amount, the Company considers historical Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate payments by product as a percentage of their historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, the lag in payment timing, changes in rebate contracts, an ev aluation of the current Medicaid and Medicare laws and interpretations, the percentage of products that are sold v ia Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare, and product pricing. Giv en v ariability in prescription drug costs and v ariability in prescription data, historical rebate information may not be predictiv e for management to estimate the rebate accrual and thus, management supplements its historical data analysis with qualitativ e adjustments based upon current expectations, particularly for select products which contribute the largest portion of the Company's rev enue.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the identified risks of material misstatement related to the v aluation of the sales rebate and discount liabilities.

      "answer": "The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for patent term restoration of up to five years for pharmaceutical products, based on the time taken for regulatory approval, which AbbVie leverages to extend exclusivity for its products. Eli Lilly, on the other hand, faces potential generic competition under the Act after four years of product marketing, as generic manufacturers can file Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) challenging innovator patents.

The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies.\n\nFurthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product i s  i nterchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\n\nGenerally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie's i ntellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a 'patent term restoration,' for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration.\n\nPharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Specific conditions of use approved for individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA's reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval i n any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.\n\nBiologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

Our foreign currency-denominated notes had carrying amounts of $6.03 billion and $7.14 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, of which $5.34 billion and $5.67 billion hav e been designated as, and are effectiv e as, hedges of net inv estments in certain of our foreign operations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely. At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $218.0 million swapping U.S. dollars to euro and 402.0 million Swiss francs swapping to U.S. dollars, with settlement dates ranging through 2028. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps hav e been designated as, and are effectiv e as, net inv estment and cash flow hedges, respectiv ely. At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to sell 7.59 billion euro and to sell 4.20 billion Chinese yuan, with settlement dates ranging through 2025, which hav e been designated as, and are effectiv e as, hedges of net inv estments.\n\nWe may also enter into foreign currency forward or option contracts as economic hedges to manage exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receiv ables denominated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and Japanese yen). Foreign currency deriv ativ es used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying exposures. These contracts are recorded at fair v alue with the gain or loss recognized in other-net, (income) expense. Forward contracts generally hav e maturities not exceeding 12 months. At December 31, 2024, our significant outstanding foreign currency forward commitments were as follows, all of which hav e settlement dates within 180 days:\n\n",

      "question": "How would obtaining pediatric exclusivity affect the total market protection period for AbbVie's biologics compared to Eli Lilly's small molecule drugs, based on the exclusivity durations described in their respective filings?",
      "answer": "For AbbVie's biologics, obtaining pediatric exclusivity would extend the 12-year regulatory exclusivity period by an additional 6 months, resulting in a total of 12.5 years of market protection. For Eli Lilly's small molecule drugs, pediatric exclusivity would add 6 months to the 5-year new chemical entity exclusivity, resulting in a total of 5.5 years of market protection. Therefore, pediatric exclusivity adds a relatively more significant extension for biologics, where the base exclusivity period is longer.",

The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies.\n\nFurthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product i s  i nterchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\n\nGenerally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie's i ntellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a 'patent term restoration,' for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration.\n\nPharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Specific conditions of use approved for individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA's reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval i n any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.\n\nBiologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

          "chunk_text": "## Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights\n\n## Overview\n\nIntellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innov ations and inv est in the search for new medicines and uses. Loss of effectiv e patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effectiv e market exclusiv ity for the product, often leading to a sev ere and rapid decline in rev enues for the product. We own, hav e applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products, product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, for some products we hav e effectiv e intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.\n\nThe patent protection generally anticipated to be of most relev ance to pharmaceuticals is prov ided by patents claiming the activ e ingredient (the compound patent) for our products, particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., major European countries, and Japan. In general, patents in each relev ant country last for a period of 20 years from their filing date, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:\n\n- Patent term adjustment is av ailable to all U.S. patent applicants to prov ide relief in the ev ent that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n- Patent term restoration for a single patent for a pharmaceutical product is prov ided to U.S. patent holders to compensate for a portion of the time inv ested in clinical trials and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rev iew process. There is a fiv e-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from initial FDA approv al. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are av ailable to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional fiv e years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approv al) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to fiv e years.\n\nIn some cases, the innov ator company may retain exclusiv ity despite approv al of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on v ersions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics and challenges, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be av ailable under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:\n\n- Data package protection generally prohibits regulatory approv al of other manufacturers' applications for marketing approv al if they rely on the innov ator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period is generally fiv e years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA, subject to certain conditions), effectiv ely 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan, which can be extended to 10 years with qualifying pediatric studies. The period begins on the date of product approv al and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relev ant patents. Legislativ e bodies in the European Union (EU) are discussing proposed reductions in data protection periods but it remains uncertain if, or when, these proposals might be adopted.\n- In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approv ed drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusiv ity\" prov ides an additional six months of exclusiv ity, which is added to the term of data protection, orphan drug exclusiv ity and, for products other than biologics, pediatric exclusiv ity is also added to the term of any relev ant and non-expired patents.\n- A specific use of a drug or biologic can receiv e \"orphan\" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably expected to recov er dev elopment and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Orphan designation entitles a particular use of the drug to sev en years of market exclusiv ity, which runs in parallel with any applicable patents.\n\nOutside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiv eness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals v ary widely. International and U.S. free trade agreements like the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) administered by the World Trade Organization prov ide global protection of certain intellectual property rights. But in a number of markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receiv e for our products. Further, many dev eloping countries, and some dev eloped countries, do not prov ide effectiv e data package protection ev en though it is specified in the TRIPs Agreement.",

      "answer": "Pfizer attributed $2,132 million in U.S. revenue growth to Xeljanz in 2022. This is significant because Amgen listed Xeljanz as one of the competitor-marketed products directly competing against ENBREL in the U.S. market, highlighting a key competitive pressure Amgen faces in maintaining ENBREL's market position.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Pfizer attributed $2,132 million in U.S. revenue growth to Xeljanz in 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amgen listed Xeljanz as a direct competitor to ENBREL in the U.S. market.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The revenue growth from Xeljanz for Pfizer represents a competitive threat to Amgen\u2019s ENBREL, as it indicates strong performance by a rival product in the same therapeutic category."

      "answer": "Amgen faces direct competition from Pfizer's Xeljanz in the U.S. market for ENBREL, one of Amgen\u2019s key products. Pfizer's Xeljanz has a U.S. basic product patent expiration in 2025, which may lead to increased market pressure on Amgen as biosimilars or alternative therapies could emerge post-patent expiration, affecting Amgen's market share and pricing power in the biologics space.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen lists Xeljanz (marketed by Pfizer) as a U.S.-only competitor to ENBREL, one of Amgen\u2019s major products.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Xeljanz\u2019s U.S. basic product patent expires in 2025, which could open the market to biosimilars or alternative treatments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - With Xeljanz's patent expiration in 2025, Pfizer\u2019s product may face increased competition, which could alter the competitive dynamics for ENBREL in the U.S., directly impacting Amgen\u2019s strategic positioning and revenue potential."

      "answer": "The elimination of the Medicaid rebate cap caused Merck to pay more in Medicaid rebates than it received from Medicaid sales of Januvia, Janumet, and Janumet XR in 2024. This led Merck to lower the list price of these products in 2025 to align with net prices, which will reduce rebate amounts and increase realized net pricing. Meanwhile, CVS recognizes revenue for long-term care pharmacy services at the amount expected to be ultimately received from payors like Medicaid, reducing revenue at recognition to account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Therefore, Merck's increased rebate burden under Medicaid directly affects the payment dynamics that CVS must consider when estimating and recognizing its own revenues.",

Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied.\n\n## Long-term Care\n\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in ex change for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements.

          "chunk_text": "\nWorldwide combined sales of Januvia and Janumet , medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, declined 33% in 2024 primarily due to lower sales in the U.S., largely reflecting lower pricing and lower demand due to competitive pressures, as well as the ongoing impact of the loss of exclusivity in most markets in Europe, the A sia Pacific region, and in Canada.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan A ct enacted in the U.S. in 2021 included a provision that eliminated the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. A s a result of this provision, the Company paid state M edicaid programs more in rebates than it received on M edicaid sales of Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR in 2024.\n\nIn early 2025, M erck lowered the list price of the Januvia family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount M erck pays to M edicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing, which will be partially offset by continuing volume declines. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products in 2025 compared with 2024.\n\nWhile the key U.S. patent for Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see  Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that Januvia and Janumet will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until M ay  2026 and Janumet XR will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company's sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA . A dditionally , i n 2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Januvia would be included in the first y ear of the IRA 's Program. Pursuant to the IRA 's Program, a government price was set for Januvia , which will become effective on January 1, 2026. A lso, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Janumet and Janumet XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA 's Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA 's Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). A s a result of the anticipated patent expiries in 2026, the government price setting in 2026 and 2027 noted above, as well as ongoing competitive pressures, the Company anticipates significant sales declines for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR in the U.S. in 2026 and thereafter.\n\nThe Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in  all  of  the  EU and for Janumet in some European countries in September 2022. Exclusivity for Janumet was lost in other European countries in A pril 2023. A ccordingly , the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue.

      "question": "How does the ACA's regulatory impact on CVS's Health Care Benefits segment differ from its effect on Merck's pharmaceutical pricing strategy, based on the specific regulatory and market pressures each company describes?",
      "answer": "The ACA imposes direct regulatory compliance burdens on CVS by restricting how it standardizes Health Care Benefits products across states, affecting pricing, underwriting, and required benefits, which increases operational complexity and costs. In contrast, for Merck, the ACA contributes to broader pricing pressures from government agencies and managed care organizations, particularly in mature markets, where it influences negotiations and reimbursement rates. These effects are compounded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which enables government price setting for certain Merck drugs like Januvia, Janumet, and Keytruda, directly limiting revenue potential. While CVS faces operational constraints due to ACA-related regulation, Merck experiences financial pressure through reduced pricing power and potential declines in U.S. sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, CVS states that the ACA restricts its ability to standardize Health Care Benefits products across states, affecting pricing, underwriting, and required benefits, increasing costs and operational complexity.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Merck notes that the ACA contributes to pricing pressures from government agencies and managed care organizations, especially in mature markets, and is compounded by the IRA's government price setting for Januvia (effective 2026), Janumet (effective 2027), and expected inclusion of Keytruda (effective 2028), which will reduce U.S. sales.",

These laws and regulations, including the ACA, restrict how the Company conducts its business and result in additional burdens and costs to the Company. Significant areas of governmental regulation include premium rates and rating methodologies, underwriting rules and procedures, required benefits, sales and marketing activities, provider rates of payment, restrictions on health plans' ability to limit providers' participation in their networks and/or remove providers from their networks and financial condition (including reserves and minimum capital or risk based capital requirements). These laws and regulations are different in each jurisdiction and vary from product to product.\n\nEach health insurer and HMO must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs are subject to state ex amination and periodic license renewal. Applicable laws also restrict the ability of the Company's regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends, and certain dividends require prior regulatory approval. In addition, some of the Company's businesses and related activities may be subject to PPO, MCO, utilization review or TPA-related licensure requirements and regulations. These licensure requirements and regulations differ from state to state, but may contain provider network, contracting, product and rate, financial and reporting requirements. There also are laws and regulations that set specific standards for the Company's delivery of services, payment of claims, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, and payment for covered benefits and services.\n\nRequired Regulatory Approvals - The Company must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to price, market and administer many of its Health Care Benefits products. Supervisory agencies, including CMS, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight and the DOL, as well as state health, insurance, managed care and Medicaid agencies, have broad authority to take one or more of the following actions:\n\n- Grant, suspend and revoke the Company's licenses to transact business;\n- Suspend or exclude the Company from participation in government programs;\n- Suspend or limit the Company's authority to market products;\n- Regulate many aspects of the products and services the Company offers, including the pricing and underwriting of many of its products and services;\n- Assess damages, fines and/or penalties;\n- Terminate the Company's contract with the government agency and/or withhold payments from the government agency to the Company;\n- Impose retroactive adjustments to premiums and require the Company to pay refunds to the government, customers and/or members;\n- Restrict the Company's ability to conduct acquisitions or dispositions;\n- Require the Company to maintain minimum capital levels in its subsidiaries and monitor its solvency and reserve adequacy;\n- Regulate the Company's investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria; and/or\n- Exclude the Company's plans from participating in Public Exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of 'unreasonable' premium rate increases or fail to meet other criteria set by HHS or the applicable state.\n\nThe Company's operations, current and past business practices, current and past contracts, and accounts and other books and records are subject to routine, regular and special investigations, audits, ex aminations and reviews by, and from time to time the Company receives subpoenas and other requests for information from, federal, state and international supervisory and enforcement agencies, Attorneys General and other state, federal and international governmental authorities and legislators.\n\nCommercial Product Pricing and Underwriting Restrictions - Pricing and underwriting regulation by states limits the Company's underwriting and rating practices and those of other health insurers, particularly for small employer groups, and varies by state. In general, these limitations apply to certain customer segments and limit the Company's ability to set prices for new or renewing groups, or both, based on specific characteristics of the group or the group's prior claim ex perience.

In the U.S., these include (i) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and M edicaid, including the M edicare Prescription Drug Improvement and M odernization A ct of 2003, the A CA , and the IRA , (ii) practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (iii) state activities aimed at increasing price transparency , including new laws as noted above in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment.' Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the U.S., as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of M edicare, M edicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. A s noted in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment,' in 2023, HHS selected Januvia for the first y ear of the IRA 's price setting program, which will result in a government set price becoming effective on January 1, 2026. Government price setting may also impact pricing in the private market, negatively affecting the Company's performance. In January 2025, HHS announced that Janumet and Janumet XR have been selected for government price setting, which will become effectiv e on January 1, 2027. Furthermore, the Company expects that in 2026 HHS will include Keytruda in a subsequent selection of products to undergo IRA price setting, with such price to become effective on January 1, 2028 and the Company expects that, as a result, U.S. sales of Keytruda will decline after that time. In addition, in the U.S., larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories. The Company must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization. The Company is also facing pricing pressure from purchasers of certain vaccines in highly competitive categories.\n\nOutside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, Japan and China have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix  the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Consequently , in those markets, the Company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the Japanese government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules.\n\nThe Company expects pricing pressures to continue in the future.\n\n## Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions, together with cost-reduction measures being taken by certain governments, could negatively affect the Company's operating results.\n\nThe Company's business may be adversely affected by local and global economic conditions, including with respect to inflation, interest rates, and costs of raw materials and packaging. Uncertainty in global economic and geopolitical conditions may result in a slowdown to the global economy that could affect the Company's business by reducing the prices that drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers may be able or willing to pay for the Company's products or by reducing the demand for the Company's products, which could in turn negatively impact the Company's sales and result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",

      "answer": "Merck faces regulatory approval risks with its in-process research and development (IPR&D) programs, particularly MK-1026, which is valued at $418 million and currently in Phase 3 clinical development. Delays or failure to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals could prevent Merck from realizing revenue from these products and may result in material impairment charges, as seen in prior years with $779 million and $1.6 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This uncertainty affects Merck's financial planning and investment in R&D, which totaled $3.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2024. Similarly, CVS faces regulatory approval risks when pursuing acquisitions as part of its inorganic growth strategy. Failure to obtain timely approvals could result in termination fees, material disruptions, and adverse effects on its stock price and credit ratings. These shared regulatory risks shape both companies' financial strategies, influencing capital allocation, investment in growth opportunities, and long-term profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - CVS may face delays or failure in obtaining regulatory approvals for acquisitions, which could result in termination fees, material disruptions, and adverse effects on its stock price and credit ratings.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Merck's MK-1026, valued at $418 million, is in Phase 3 clinical development and subject to regulatory approval risks; failure to obtain approval could result in impairment charges, which were $779 million in 2023 and $1.6 billion in 2022.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face regulatory approval risks that significantly impact their financial planning and long-term growth strategies. Merck's risk centers on R&D investment and potential impairment charges, while CVS's risk affects its acquisition strategy and capital structure."

The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company recorded net assets of $165 million, as well as a charge of $656 million to Research and development expenses, or $0.26 per share, in 2024 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition. In A ugust 2024, M erck and Daiichi Sankyo expanded their  ex isting  global  co-dev elopment  and  co-commercialization  agreement  to  include  M K-6070.  M erck  recognized  income  (recorded  within Other  (income) expense, net ) of $170 million, or $0.05 per share, due to the receipt of an upfront cash payment from Daiichi Sankyo and has also satisfied a contingent quid obligation from the original collaboration agreement.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development\n\nIn connection with business combinations, the Company records the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility . A t  December 31, 2024, the balance of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) was $430 million, primarily consisting of M K-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $418 million, which is in Phase 3 clinical development.\n\nThe IPR&amp;D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&amp;D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. The time periods to receive approvals from the FDA  and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty . Significant delays in the approval process, or the Company's failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the Company from realizing revenues from these products. A dditionally , if the IPR&amp;D programs require additional clinical trial data than previously anticipated, or if the programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the Company will not recover the fair value of the IPR&amp;D recorded as an asset as of the acquisition date. If such circumstances were to occur, the Company's future operating results could be adversely affected and the Company may recognize impairment charges, which could be material.\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded IPR&amp;D impairment charges within Research and development expenses of $779 million and $1.6 billion, respectively (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nAdditional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility . The costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the FDA  or other regulatory agencies for approval.\n\n## Capital E xpenditures\n\nCapital expenditures were $3.4 billion in 2024, $3.9 billion in 2023 and $4.4 billion in 2022.

      "question": "How does the ACA's minimum Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirement for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans impact both CVS's enrollment eligibility and Merck's drug pricing strategies under Medicare Part D, and what are the potential consequences for each company?",
      "answer": "The ACA's requirement that Medicare Advantage and Part D plans maintain a minimum MLR of 85% directly affects CVS's ability to enroll new members if certain contracts fail to meet this threshold for three consecutive years, and could lead to contract termination after five years. This forces CVS to closely manage its benefit designs and reimbursement strategies to stay compliant. Meanwhile, Merck is impacted through its involvement in Medicare Part D, where the ACA is cited as part of a broader regulatory framework influencing drug pricing. Specifically, Merck notes that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), building on ACA-era structures, enables government price setting for drugs like Januvia, Janumet, and Keytruda, which will take effect in 2026 and 2028, respectively. This will likely reduce Merck\u2019s U.S. sales for these products. The combined effect is that while the ACA constrains CVS\u2019s operational flexibility in Medicare enrollment, it indirectly shapes Merck\u2019s pricing power and revenue outlook under Part D.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The ACA requires a minimum MLR of 85% for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, and contracts that fail to meet this for three consecutive years risk losing new enrollment eligibility, and after five years, face termination.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Merck notes that the ACA, along with the IRA, affects the regulatory environment for Medicare Part D, and that government price setting under the IRA will apply to Januvia (2026), Janumet (2027), and Keytruda (2028), with expected negative impacts on U.S. sales.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are affected by the ACA through its influence on Medicare Part D: CVS faces operational constraints due to MLR compliance, while Merck faces direct pricing limitations under Part D as extended by the IRA, which builds on ACA's framework."

          "chunk_text": "The provisions of the ACA significantly increased the Company's exposure to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs. For example, the ACA requires minimum MLRs for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans of 85%. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to enroll new members. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. It is possible that certain Medicare Advantage contracts may not meet the 85% MLR for consecutive years.\n\nPayments the Company receives from CMS for its Medicare Advantage and Part D businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled. Elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'DOJ'), the OIG and CMS itself. For example, CMS made significant changes to the structure of the hierarchical condition category model in version 28, which may impact risk adjustment factor ('RAF') scores for a larger percentage of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and could result in changes to beneficiary RAF scores with or without a change in the patient's health status. CMS continuously evaluates how and where risk adjustment is captured, which from time-to-time has included the capture of diagnosis codes in home visits. A legislative or regulatory change to the ability of Medicare Advantage plans to use home visits as a means to evaluate and diagnosis their members' health conditions, or substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism, including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions, could: materially affect the amount of the Company's Medicare reimbursement; require the Company to raise prices or reduce the benefits offered to Medicare beneficiaries; impact the services provided by, or the financial performance of, Oak Street Health and Signify Health; and potentially limit the Company's (and the industry's) participation in the Medicare program.\n\nThe Company will continue to offer a wide range of Medicare products across the country to meet the diverse health care needs of its customers, including Individual Medicare Advantage, Group Medicare, Special Needs Plans, Medicare Supplement plans and Prescription Drug Plans.\n\nAdditionally, there is growing interest among policymakers in re-evaluating how benchmarks are constructed in Medicare Advantage compared to Medicare Fee-ForService programs, such as MSSP and ACO REACH. Policymakers could pursue various strategies including, among other things, re-evaluating benchmark construction, risk adjustment methodology and alignment in quality measures. In addition, the CMS Innovation Center could offer new models or suspend present models that could have a material impact on the success of the Company's ACO and Oak Street Health businesses. For example, the CMS Innovation Center could mandate or offer participation in certain models that require providers and/or risk-bearing entities to take risk for a geographic population of patients, or it could look to methodologies that infer risk, survey data and non-diagnosis-based data with potential impacts to the Company's businesses. Uncertainties about how policymakers and CMS may re-evaluate how benchmarks are constructed in Medicare Advantage, including the future of VBC and mandatory participation, could create new considerations for the Company.\n\nThe Company has invested significant resources to comply with Medicare standards, and its Medicare compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources. CMS may seek premium and other refunds, prohibit the Company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in or refuse to passively enroll members in one or more of the Company's Medicare or dual eligible plans, exclude us from participating in one or more Medicare, dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs and/or institute other sanctions and/or civil monetary penalties against the Company if it fails to comply with CMS regulations or its Medicare contractual requirements. The Company's Medicare Supplement products are regulated at the state level and are subject to similar significant compliance requirements and risks.\n\nGoing forward, the Company expects CMS, the OIG, the DOJ, other federal agencies and the U.S. Congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component of the Medicare program (including Medicare Advantage, PDPs, dual eligible plans, broker compensation and marketing, prior authorization, and provider network access and adequacy), modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers' roles. Any of the federal agencies noted above or U.S. Congress may also recommend changes or take additional action with respect to the way in which brokers and agents are compensated for selling our Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. For example, CMS finalized new requirements imposing limitations on the amounts and types of payments that brokers and agents can earn for marketing and enrollment services with respect to Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. The effectiveness of these requirements is currently subject to an injunction. If the injunction is lifted or CMS attempts to impose restrictions on broker and agent compensation in the future, the Company will be required to comply with the new restrictions.",

A s noted in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment,' in 2023, HHS selected Januvia for the first y ear of the IRA 's price setting program, which will result in a government set price becoming effective on January 1, 2026. Government price setting may also impact pricing in the private market, negatively affecting the Company's performance. In January 2025, HHS announced that Janumet and Janumet XR have been selected for government price setting, which will become effectiv e on January 1, 2027. Furthermore, the Company expects that in 2026 HHS will include Keytruda in a subsequent selection of products to undergo IRA price setting, with such price to become effective on January 1, 2028 and the Company expects that, as a result, U.S. sales of Keytruda will decline after that time. In addition, in the U.S., larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories. The Company must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization. The Company is also facing pricing pressure from purchasers of certain vaccines in highly competitive categories.\n\nOutside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, Japan and China have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix  the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Consequently , in those markets, the Company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the Japanese government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules.\n\nThe Company expects pricing pressures to continue in the future.\n\n## Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions, together with cost-reduction measures being taken by certain governments, could negatively affect the Company's operating results.\n\nThe Company's business may be adversely affected by local and global economic conditions, including with respect to inflation, interest rates, and costs of raw materials and packaging.

      "answer": "Abbott must ensure that all its medical devices comply with the EU MDR by May 26, 2021, or face conditional post-market requirements. Medtronic, on the other hand, must obtain CE Mark certification under the new MDR for new devices and can continue marketing devices with valid CE certificates issued under the old directives until May 2024. Both companies must align their regulatory strategies to meet these timelines to maintain uninterrupted access to the EU market.",

          "chunk_text": "In the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaced the existing  directives  in  the  EU  for  medical  devices  and  imposes  additional  premarket  and  post-market  regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. The MDR applies to manufacturers as of May 26, 2021 after a fouryear transition period. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the MDR.\n\nSome  products  require  submission  of  a  design  dossier  to  the  appropriate  regulatory  authority  for  review  and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which  includes  testing  results  and  clinical  evaluations  but  can  self-certify  its  ability  to  apply  the  CE  mark  to  the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions.\n\nAfter approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority.\n\nIn the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.\n\nIn  the  U.S.,  the  FDA  requires  that  it  be  notified  of  proposed  new  formulations  and  formulation  or  packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA's confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products.\n\n## Areas of Focus\n\nIn 2022 and beyond, Abbott's significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following:\n\nEstablished  Pharmaceuticals  - Abbott  focuses  on  building  country-specific  portfolios  made  up  of  high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product  portfolio  in  key  therapeutic  areas  with  the  aim  of  being  among  the  first  to  launch  new  off-patent  and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott  is  also  actively  working  on  the  further  development  of  several  key  brands  such  as  Creon\u2122,  Duphaston\u2122, Duphalac\u2122  and  Influvac\u2122.  Depending  on  the  product,  the  activities  focus  on  development  of  new  data,  markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications.\n\nMedical Devices - Abbott's research and development programs focus on:\n\n- Cardiac Rhythm Management - Development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies.\n- Heart  Failure  -  Continued  enhancements  to Abbott's  mechanical  circulatory  support  and  pulmonary  artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability.\n- Electrophysiology  -  Development  of  next-generation  technologies  in  the  areas  of  ablation,  diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording.\n- Vascular  -  Development  of  next-generation  technologies  for  use  in  coronary  and  peripheral  vascular procedures.\n- Structural Heart - Development of transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves, and occlusion therapies for congenital heart defects and stroke-risk reduction.\n- Neuromodulation - Development of additional clinical evidence and next-generation technologies leveraging digital  health  to  improve  patient  and  physician  engagement  to  treat  chronic  pain,  movement  disorders  and other indications.\n- Diabetes  Care  -  Develop  enhancements  and  additional  indications  for  the  FreeStyle  Libre  platform  of continuous glucose monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes.",

Properties' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European regulatory authorities such as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom Republic of Ireland and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany, the China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), and other government  agencies  inside  and  outside  the  U.S.  To  varying  degrees,  each  of  these  agencies  requires  us  to  comply  with  laws  and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. Our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations.\n\n## Product Approval and Monitoring\n\nMany countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality of our products. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally obtained in one of two primary ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. This process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process.\n\nIn the E.U., a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and  then,  according  to  their  classification,  comply  with  one  or  more  of  a  selection  of  conformity  assessment  routes.  The  competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017 which imposes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements (EU MDR). The regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on May 26, 2021. Medical devices marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directives before May 2020, can be placed on the market until May 2024.\n\nThe  global  regulatory  environment  is  increasingly  stringent  and  unpredictable.  While  harmonization  of  global  regulations  has  been pursued,  requirements  continue  to  differ  significantly  among  countries.  We  expect  this  global  regulatory  environment  will  continue  to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals  for  our  products.  Regulations  of  the  U.S.  FDA  and  other  regulatory  agencies  in  and  outside  the  U.S.  impose  extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing practices, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers' required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future pre-market approvals or result in  a  substantial  modification  to  our  business  practices  and  operations.  For  additional  information,  see  \"Item  1A.  Risk  Factors\" We are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations .\n\n## Trade Regulations\n\nThe  movement  of  products,  services,  and  investment  across  borders  subjects  us  to  extensive  trade  regulations. A  variety  of  laws  and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across  borders.  These  laws  and  regulations  govern,  among  other  things,  our  import,  export  and  other  business  activities.  We  are  also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. Some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement  action,  and  varying  degrees  of  liability.  Such  actions  may  disrupt  or  delay  sales  of  our  products  or  services  or  result  in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business.",

Abbott must also spend significant resources to maintain compliance with evolving postmarketing requirements, including adverse event reporting and facility inspections. For Medtronic, the guidelines heighten product liability risks because stricter regulatory standards may lead to increased scrutiny of product performance, potentially triggering recalls, safety alerts, or litigation due to perceived quality issues. Both companies face a combined challenge: Abbott's delayed product approvals reduce its ability to introduce competitive innovations, while Medtronic's exposure to liability from product recalls or safety concerns harms its brand reputation. This dual impact limits their agility and market responsiveness, which could erode their market share in the medical device sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.\n\nAbbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and  state  authorities.  The  process  of  obtaining  regulatory  approvals  to  market  a  drug,  medical  device,  diagnostic product,  or  nutritional  product  can  be  costly  and  time-consuming,  and  approvals  might  not  be  granted  for  future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure  to  obtain,  approvals  for  future  products,  or  new  indications  and  uses,  could  result  in  delayed  realization  of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\n\nIn  addition,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  Abbott  will  remain  in  compliance  with  applicable  FDA  and  other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include,  among  other  things,  regulations  regarding  manufacturing  practices,  product  labeling,  and  advertising  and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those  of  Abbott's  suppliers  are  subject  to  ongoing  regulation,  including  periodic  inspection  by  the  FDA  and  other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution.\n\nThese  actions  could  result  in,  among  other  things,  substantial  modifications  to Abbott's  business  practices  and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities  while  Abbott  or  Abbott's  suppliers  remedy  the  alleged  violation;  the  inability  to  obtain  future  pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\n## Laws  and  regulations  affecting  government  benefit  programs  could  impose  new  obligations  on  Abbott,  require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.\n\nAbbott's  industry  is  subject  to  various  international,  supranational,  federal,  and  state  laws  and  regulations pertaining  to  government  benefit  program  reimbursement,  price  reporting  and  regulation,  and  health  care  fraud  and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in  some  instances,  substantial  fines,  imprisonment,  and  exclusion  from  participation  in  government  health  care programs,  including  Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  Veterans Administration  health  programs  in  the  U.S.  These  laws  and regulations  are  broad  in  scope  and  they  are  subject  to  evolving  interpretations,  which  could  require Abbott  to  incur substantial  costs  associated  with  compliance  or  to  alter  one  or  more  of  its  sales  or  marketing  practices.  In  addition, violations  of  these  laws,  or  allegations  of  such  violations,  could  disrupt  Abbott's  business  and  result  in  a  material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.\n\nBoth in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott's products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them.\n\nFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act  of  2010  address  access  to  health  care  products  and  services. These  provisions  may  be  modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\n\nFor  additional  information  concerning  health  care  regulation,  see  the  discussion  in  'Regulation'  under  Item  1, 'Business.'\n\n## The  expiration  or  loss  of  intellectual  property  protection  and  licenses  may  affect  Abbott's  future  revenues  and operating income.\n\nMany of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could  be  reduced.  Any  material  litigation  regarding  Abbott's  patents  and  trademarks  is  described  in  the  section captioned 'Legal Proceedings.'",

In  addition,  any  public  announcements  related  to  litigation  or administrative proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nWhile we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets or agreements  (such  as  employee,  non-disclosure  and  non-competition  agreements)  may  not  adequately  protect  our  intellectual  property. Further, pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or too limited in scope to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage. In addition, our patents will expire over time, our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain, and infringement may go undetected. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. In addition, license agreements could be terminated. We also rely  on  non-disclosure  and  non-competition  agreements  with  certain  employees,  consultants  and  other  parties  to  protect,  in  part,  trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.\n\nIn addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market or manufacture some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that substantially mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\n## Quality problems could lead to recalls or safety alerts, product liability claims, reputational harm, adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the impact on patients, and the serious and potentially costly consequences of adverse product performance. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some  of  the  medical  devices  we  manufacture  and  sell  are  designed  to  be  implanted  in  the  human  body  for  long  periods  of  time  or indefinitely.  Component  failures,  manufacturing  nonconformances,  design  defects,  off-label  use,  or  inadequate  disclosure  of  productrelated risks or product-related information with respect to our products, if they were to occur, could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions, which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Due to the strong name recognition of the Medtronic brand, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in diminished market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future. Further, we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed, manufactured and/or marketed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and unpredictable or accelerated changes in demand for certain of our products in connection with COVID-19 and its related impacts could impact development and production of products and services and could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or related claims, as well as adversely impact our customer relationships and reputation.\n\nStrong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could  decline.  Our  success  also  can  depend  on  our  ability  to  manufacture  to  exact  specification  precision-engineered  components, subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation, competitive advantage and market share could be harmed. In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall  of  products  or  temporarily  shut  down  production  lines  based  on  performance  relative  to  our  own  internal  safety  and  quality monitoring and testing data.\n\nAny of the foregoing problems, including future product liability claims or recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Healthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be actions and proposals by several governments, regulators and third-party payers globally, including the U.S. federal and state governments, to control these costs and, more generally, to reform healthcare systems. Certain of these actions and proposals, among other things, limit the prices we are able to charge for  our  products  or  the  amounts  of  reimbursement  available  for  our  products  and  could  limit  the  acceptance  and  availability  of  our products. These actions and proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",

      "answer": "Both Abbott and Medtronic face significant financial risk exposure due to their dependency on Medicare reimbursement rules. Abbott incurs substantial costs to comply with evolving healthcare regulations, including those related to Medicare, and potential violations could lead to substantial fines, exclusion from government programs, and adverse effects on revenues and profitability. Similarly, Medtronic highlights that its business is critically dependent on customers (such as hospitals and physicians) obtaining appropriate Medicare reimbursement for its products. Any adverse regulatory decisions or failure to comply with Medicare-related laws could restrict Medtronic's ability to market products and result in material adverse effects on its financial condition and cash flows. Therefore, both companies are exposed to financial penalties and operational disruptions if they fail to align with Medicare reimbursement rules, compounding their regulatory compliance burdens.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott faces financial risks due to evolving interpretations of healthcare laws, including Medicare-related regulations, which could require substantial compliance costs and alter sales or marketing practices.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Medtronic notes that its customers rely heavily on Medicare reimbursement, and adverse regulatory decisions or non-compliance could lead to exclusion from government programs, substantial fines, and material adverse effects on financial condition and cash flows.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to financial and operational risks stemming from Medicare reimbursement rules. Abbott faces risks through compliance costs and penalties, while Medtronic faces downstream risks due to customer reliance on Medicare reimbursement for its products. Together, this dependency creates a shared financial vulnerability."

          "chunk_text": "## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.\n\nAbbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and  state  authorities.  The  process  of  obtaining  regulatory  approvals  to  market  a  drug,  medical  device,  diagnostic product,  or  nutritional  product  can  be  costly  and  time-consuming,  and  approvals  might  not  be  granted  for  future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure  to  obtain,  approvals  for  future  products,  or  new  indications  and  uses,  could  result  in  delayed  realization  of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\n\nIn  addition,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  Abbott  will  remain  in  compliance  with  applicable  FDA  and  other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include,  among  other  things,  regulations  regarding  manufacturing  practices,  product  labeling,  and  advertising  and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those  of  Abbott's  suppliers  are  subject  to  ongoing  regulation,  including  periodic  inspection  by  the  FDA  and  other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution.\n\nThese  actions  could  result  in,  among  other  things,  substantial  modifications  to Abbott's  business  practices  and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities  while  Abbott  or  Abbott's  suppliers  remedy  the  alleged  violation;  the  inability  to  obtain  future  pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\n## Laws  and  regulations  affecting  government  benefit  programs  could  impose  new  obligations  on  Abbott,  require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.\n\nAbbott's  industry  is  subject  to  various  international,  supranational,  federal,  and  state  laws  and  regulations pertaining  to  government  benefit  program  reimbursement,  price  reporting  and  regulation,  and  health  care  fraud  and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in  some  instances,  substantial  fines,  imprisonment,  and  exclusion  from  participation  in  government  health  care programs,  including  Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  Veterans Administration  health  programs  in  the  U.S.  These  laws  and regulations  are  broad  in  scope  and  they  are  subject  to  evolving  interpretations,  which  could  require Abbott  to  incur substantial  costs  associated  with  compliance  or  to  alter  one  or  more  of  its  sales  or  marketing  practices.  In  addition, violations  of  these  laws,  or  allegations  of  such  violations,  could  disrupt  Abbott's  business  and  result  in  a  material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.\n\nBoth in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott's products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them.\n\nFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act  of  2010  address  access  to  health  care  products  and  services. These  provisions  may  be  modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\n\nFor  additional  information  concerning  health  care  regulation,  see  the  discussion  in  'Regulation'  under  Item  1, 'Business.'\n\n## The  expiration  or  loss  of  intellectual  property  protection  and  licenses  may  affect  Abbott's  future  revenues  and operating income.\n\nMany of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could  be  reduced.  Any  material  litigation  regarding  Abbott's  patents  and  trademarks  is  described  in  the  section captioned 'Legal Proceedings.'",

The U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing  and  selling  our  products  and  limit  our  ability  to  obtain  future  pre-market  clearances  or  approvals,  and  could  result  in  a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Furthermore, we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information  from  state  and  federal  governmental  agencies,  and  while  these  investigations  typically  relate  primarily  to  financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices, we cannot predict the timing, outcome or impact of any such investigations. Any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative  remedies,  including  exclusion  from  government reimbursement programs and/or entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional, costly compliance obligations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\n\nGovernmental regulations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. are constantly changing and may become increasingly stringent. In the European Union, for example, the Medical Device Regulation which became effective in May 2021 includes significant additional pre-market and post-market  requirements.  Penalties  for  regulatory  non-compliance  could  be  severe,  including  fines  and  revocation  or  suspension  of  a company's business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. The development and implementation of future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nOur devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care  plans,  for  the  healthcare  services  provided  to  their  patients. The  ability  of  our  customers  to  obtain  appropriate  reimbursement  for products  and  services  from  third-party  payers  is  critical  because  it  affects  which  products  customers  purchase  and  the  prices  they  are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health are goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers. In certain circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\n\nWe are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies, and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the U.S. and around the world. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems, could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.\n\nWe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related  to  our  rights  or  the  rights  of  others  may  result  in  our  payment  of  significant  monetary  damages  and/or  royalty  payments, negatively impacting our ability to sell current or future products.\n\nWe  are  substantially  dependent  on  patent  and  other  proprietary  rights  and  rely  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and agreements (such as employee, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements) to protect our business and proprietary intellectual property. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or that enforcement actions to protect our patent and proprietary rights against others could be unsuccessful, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNATURE OF BUSINESS - Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.\n\nBASIS  OF  CONSOLIDATION  -  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES - The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States  and  necessarily  include  amounts  based  on  estimates  and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales  rebates,  income  taxes,  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefits,  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net  assets  of  foreign  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currencies  are  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar  are  translated  into  U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of  these  subsidiaries  at  changing  rates  are  recorded  in  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment  account,  which  is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nREVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related  sales  are  recorded.  Sales  incentives  to  customers  are  not  material.  Historical  data  is  readily  available  and reliable,  and  is  used  for  estimating  the  amount  of  the  reduction  in  gross  sales.  Revenue  from  the  launch  of  a  new product,  from  an  improved  version  of  an  existing  product,  or  for  shipments  in  excess  of  a  customer's  normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve  for  such  revenue,  if  necessary.  In  certain  of  Abbott's  businesses,  primarily  within  diagnostics,  Abbott participates  in  selling  arrangements  that  include  multiple  performance  obligations  (e.g.,  instruments,  reagents, procedures,  and  service  agreements).  The  total  transaction  price  of  the  contract  is  allocated  to  each  performance obligation  in  an  amount  based  on  the  estimated  relative  standalone  selling  prices  of  the  promised  goods  or  services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights.\n\nINCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when  the  taxes  are  paid.  No  additional  income  taxes  have  been  provided  for  any  remaining  undistributed  foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Effective for fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  31,  2017,  the  TCJA  subjects  taxpayers  to  tax  on  global  intangible  low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\n\nEARNINGS PER SHARE - Unvested restricted stock  units  and  awards  that  contain  non-forfeitable  rights  to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the twoclass  method.  Under  the  two-class  method,  net  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participating securities.  Earnings  from  Continuing  Operations  allocated  to  common  shares  in  2021,  2020  and  2019  were  $7.042 billion,  $4.449  billion  and  $3.666  billion,  respectively.  Net  earnings  allocated  to  common  shares  in  2021,  2020  and 2019 were $7.042 billion, $4.473 billion and $3.666 billion, respectively.\n\nPENSION AND  POST-EMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS  - Abbott  accrues  for  the  actuarially  determined  cost  of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop longterm assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return  on  plan  assets.  Differences  between  the  expected  long-term  return  on  plan  assets  and  the  actual  return  are amortized  over  a  five-year  period.  Actuarial  losses  and  gains  are  amortized  over  the  remaining  service  attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.",

For goodwill, other intangible assets, and IPR&amp;D, inputs used in the fair value analysis fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value.\n\nCertain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient include certain debt funds, equity and fixed income commingled trusts, and registered investment companies.\n\nRevenue Recognition The Company sells its products through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. The Company recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer. For products sold through direct sales representatives and independent distributors, control is transferred upon shipment or upon delivery, based on the contract terms and legal requirements. For consignment inventory, control is transferred when the product is used or implanted. Payment terms vary depending on the country of sale, type of customer, and type of product.\n\nIf  a  contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. Shipping and handling is treated as a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service, and therefore, is not considered a performance obligation. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenue producing transaction and collected by the Company from customers (for example, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes) are not included in revenue. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money.\n\nThe amount of revenue recognized reflects sales rebates and returns, which are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, the stated  rebate  rates,  and  other  relevant  information.  The  Company  records  adjustments  to  rebates  and  returns  reserves  as  increases  or decreases of revenue.\n\nThe Company records a deferred revenue liability if a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer.  Deferred  revenue  primarily  represents  remote  monitoring  services  and  equipment  maintenance,  for  which  consideration  is received at the same time as consideration for the device or equipment. Revenue related to remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance is recognized over the service period as time elapses.\n\nShipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred to physically move product from the Company's premises to the customer's premises are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income and were $354 million, $308 million, and $347 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Other shipping and handling costs incurred to store, move, and prepare products for shipment are recognized in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nResearch and Development Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs include costs of  research,  engineering,  and  technical  activities  to  develop  a  new  product  or  service  or  make  significant  improvement  to  an  existing product or manufacturing process. Research and development costs also include pre-approval regulatory and clinical trial expenses.\n\nContingencies The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable, and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.\n\nIncome Taxes The Company has deferred taxes that arise as a result of the different treatment of transactions for U.S. GAAP and income tax accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future  years  for  which  the  Company  has  already  recognized  the  tax  benefit  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  The  Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense for which payment has been deferred or expense has already  been  taken  as  a  deduction  on  the  Company's  tax  return  but  has  not  yet  been  recognized  as  an  expense  in  the  consolidated statements of income. See Footnote 13 for more information on the Company's uncertain tax positions and tax policies.\n\nOther Operating Expense, Net Other operating expense, net primarily includes royalty income and expense, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, changes in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a past acquisition, charges related to the June 2021 decision to stop the distribution and sale of Medtronic's HVAD System within the Mechanical Circulatory Support Operating Unit (MCS) (MCS charges), impairment charges, and income from funded research and development arrangements.",

      "question": "How does Gilead Sciences' (GILD) exposure to the BIOSECURE Act differ from Eli Lilly's (LLY) in terms of potential operational impact on their pharmaceutical supply chains, based on their respective 2024 10-K disclosures?",
      "answer": "Gilead Sciences (GILD) faces a direct operational risk from the BIOSECURE Act due to its reliance on foreign-owned entities for biotechnology equipment and services used in clinical trials and clinical/commercial manufacturing. If the Act is enacted, GILD could face increased costs, supply limitations, procurement delays, and adverse effects on product launches and financial condition. In contrast, Eli Lilly (LLY) states in its 2024 10-K that, although the BIOSECURE Act is under consideration, it does not anticipate the bill would have a material impact on its business. This indicates that LLY perceives its exposure to the Act as significantly lower or manageable without substantial operational disruption.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GILD's 10-K, extract the specific risk related to the BIOSECURE Act potentially prohibiting U.S. agencies from contracting with companies using biotechnology equipment or services from certain foreign-owned entities, which GILD uses in clinical trials and manufacturing.",
        "Step 2: From LLY's 10-K, extract the statement that while the BIOSECURE Act is under consideration, the company does not anticipate it would have a material impact on its business.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two perspectives to contrast the operational risk exposure: GILD faces tangible supply chain and cost risks, while LLY does not foresee a material impact."

          "chunk_text": "## We are impacted by evolving laws, regulations and legislative or regulatory actions applicable to the healthcare industry.\n\nThe healthcare industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to drug approval, manufacturing, reimbursement, rebates, price reporting, healthcare fraud and abuse, and data privacy and security. In the U.S., these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, laws and regulations relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state programs, such as the Medicaid Rebate Statute and the 340B statute, laws that regulate written and verbal communications about our products, individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing  practices,  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability Act  and  other  federal  and  state  laws  relating  to  the  privacy  and  security  of  health information, including the Executive Order on Preventing Access to Americans' Bulk Sensitive Personal Data, which may impact how and where clinical and other sensitive data is shared, accessed and analyzed, and United States G overnment-Related Data by Countries of Concern issued in February 2024. Actual or alleged violations of these laws or any related regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and U.S. Department of V eterans Affairs and U.S. Department of  Defense  health  programs,  actions  against  executives  overseeing  our  business  and  significant  remediation  measures,  negative  publicity  or  other consequences. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to changing and evolving interpretations, including as a result of legal challenges, which may increase following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overrule the Chevron doctrine, any of which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance, alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices, or impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. The resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material. Additionally, recently proposed legislation in the U.S., such as the BIOSECURE Act (which, among other things, could prohibit U.S. executive agencies from contracting with, or expending loans or granting funds to, companies that use biotechnology equipment or services for certain activities from certain foreign-owned entities), has the potential to adversely impact our ability to receive equipment or services from such entities, including certain of which we use in connection with our clinical trials and our clinical and commercial manufacturing, which could increase the cost or limit the supply of material available to us, delay the procurement or supply of such material, delay or impact clinical trials and regulatory submissions, delay the launch of commercial products and adversely affect our financial condition and business prospects.\n\nIn addition, government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, and we are continually assessing the methods by which we calculate and report pricing in accordance with these obligations. Our methodologies for calculations are inherently subject to assumptions and may be subject to review and challenge by various government agencies, which may disagree with our interpretation. If the government disagrees with our reported calculations, we may need to restate previously reported data and could be subject to additional financial and legal liability.\n\nThere also continues to be enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs and manufacturer donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by governments on reimbursement support offerings and other patient support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. Despite our training and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from unlawful acts committed by our employees or agents. If we, or our agents and vendors, are deemed to have failed to comply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any of these areas, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Any similar violations by our competitors could also negatively impact our industry's reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products.\n\nFor a description of our government investigations and related litigation, see Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and defend our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally, and to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.\n\nPatents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the U.S. and internationally covering our compounds, products and technology. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain patents and licenses to patent  rights,  enforce  our  patents  and  defend  against  infringement  of  our  patents  and  efforts  to  invalidate  them,  operate  without  infringing  on  the  intellectual property of others, and preserve trade secrets and internal know-how.",

          "chunk_text": "## Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Developments\n\nReforms, including those that may stem from political initiativ es, periods of unev en economic growth or downturns, or as a result of inflation or deflation, the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or gov ernment budgeting priorities, are expected to continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\n\nGlobal concern ov er access to, and affordability of, pharmaceutical products continues to driv e regulatory and legislativ e debate and action, as well as cost containment efforts by gov ernmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictiv e formularies, changes to av ailable intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In 2022, the U.S. gov ernment enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices (HHS) to effectiv ely set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these gov ernment prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approv ed under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approv al or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product's best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negativ e impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would hav e the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion prior to expiry of exclusiv ities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\n\nOther IRA prov isions require drug manufacturers to prov ide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025, the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Cov erage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to v arious penalties, including civ il monetary penalties, which could be significant.\n\nThe IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiv eness of inv estment in small molecule innov ation. The IRA can cause changes to dev elopment approach and timing and inv estments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by lawmakers, regulators, and other authorities in the U.S. and worldwide, could adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, the U.S. House of Representativ es recently passed the BIOSECURE Act, which is under consideration in the U.S. Senate. This legislation, if passed, could affect elements of the pharmaceutical supply chain; although as currently drafted we do not anticipate the bill would hav e a material impact on our business.",

The wholesalers or distributors then charge the discount back to us.\n\nOther  gross-to-net  deductions  include  patient  co-pay  assistance,  cash  discounts  for  prompt  payment,  distributor  fees  that  we  pay  under  our  inventory management agreements with our significant U.S. wholesalers and are based on contractually-determined fixed percentage of sales, and sales return provisions.\n\nOur gross-to-net deductions totaled $17.8 billion, or 38%, of gross product sales in 2024, compared to $16.4 billion, or 38%, of gross product sales in 2023. Of the $17.8 billion in 2024, $15.5 billion, or 33%, of gross product sales was related to rebates and chargebacks, and $2.3 billion, or 5%, was related to other gross-to-net deductions. Of the $16.4 billion in 2023, $14.3 billion, or 33%, of gross product sales was related to rebates and chargebacks, and $2.2 billion, or 5%, was related to other gross-to-net deductions.\n\nCurrent year gross-to-net deductions as a percent of gross product sales may not be indicative of future results.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Impact\n\nWe generally face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures.\n\nApproximately 27% and 26% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2024 and 2023, respectively. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our total product sales of $163 million in 2024, based on a comparison using foreign currency exchange rates from 2023.",

Quality,  reliability  and  speed  are  critical  in  cell  therapy manufacturing to quickly and safely deliver our cell therapies to patients. Any delays or quality issues with our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business and damage our reputation. In addition, we may not be able to sufficiently increase manufacturing network capacity to meet growing demand.\n\n## Our success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products.\n\nIf we are unable to launch commercially successful new products or new indications for existing products, including approval for earlier lines of therapy, our business will be adversely impacted. The launch of commercially successful products is necessary to grow our business, cover our substantial R&amp;D expenses, and offset revenue losses when existing products lose market share due to factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in drug development and the introduction of new products. The product development cycle is characterized by significant investments of resources, long lead times and unpredictable outcomes due to the nature of developing medicines for human use. We expend significant time and resources on our product pipeline as well as on preparations for potential commercial launch without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. Such failures have had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on our business and financial results, including as a result of our inability to recover R&amp;D, clinical trial, acquisition-related and other ex penses incurred in connection with the development of and launch preparations for our product candidates. For example, we enter into commitments to purchase materials and supplies in anticipation of the potential manufacture and sale of new product candidates, and in the event the development, approval or launch of these product candidates is delayed or otherwise unsuccessful, we may experience excess inventory that needs to be written down, losses on firm commitments to purchase inventory, or other costs and expenses resulting from such commitments.\n\n## We face challenges in accurately forecasting sales because of the difficulties in predicting demand for our products and fluctuations in purchasing patterns or wholesaler inventories.\n\nWe may be unable to accurately predict demand for our products as demand depends on a number of factors. If we do not accurately forecast demand or manufacture products at levels to align with actual demand, then we may experience product shortages or build excess inventory that may need to be written off. For example, product demand may be adversely affected if physicians do not see the benefit of our products. Additionally, uptake of new products may not materialize as expected, or at all in the case of unsuccessful product candidates. For example, V eklury sales generally reflect COVID-19 related rates and severity of infections and hospitalizations, as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of vaccines and alternative treatments for COVID-19, and future sales in the short- and long-term remain uncertain.\n\nAdditionally, the non-retail sector in the U.S., which includes government institutions, including state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be less consistent in terms of buying patterns and often causes quarterover-quarter fluctuations that do not mirror actual patient demand for our products. Federal and state budget pressures, as well as the annual grant cycles for federal and state funds, may cause purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand for our products. We expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers. In light of the budget crises faced by many European countries, we have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some government agencies and other purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels, and we may continue to see this trend in the future.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the U.S. exclusively through the wholesaler/distributor channel. Historically, approximately 90% of our product sales in the U.S. have been to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., Cencora, Inc., and McKesson Corporation, and their specialty distributor affiliates. The U.S. wholesalers and distributors with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end-user demand and may not be accurate in matching their inventory levels to actual end-user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers and distributors can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers and distributors do not match end-user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail and specialty pharmacies and other non-wholesaler/distributor locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic conditions, increased competition or other factors may cause retail and specialty pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and distributors and, consequently, the wholesalers' and distributors' orders from us, even if enduser demand has not changed. In addition, we have observed that strong wholesaler/distributor and sub-wholesaler/distributor purchases of our products in the second half of the year typically results in inventory draw-down by wholesalers/distributors and sub-wholesalers/distributors in the subsequent first quarter. As inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues.",

This estimate is based on sev eral factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (on av erage, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated lev els of inv entory in the wholesale and retail channels, as well as any other specifically identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusiv ity, product recalls and discontinuations, or a changing competitiv e env ironment. We maintain a returns policy that allows most U.S. customers to return most of our products for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusiv ity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elev ated lev el of product returns as product inv entory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserv e hav e been and may in the future be required based on rev ised estimates to our assumptions. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arriv e at our net product rev enue. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed; we do not record a right of return asset. Our returns policies outside the U.S. are generally more restrictiv e than in the U.S. as returns are not allowed for reasons other than failure to meet product specifications in many countries. Our reserv e for future product returns for product sales outside the U.S. is not material.\n- As a part of our process to estimate a reserv e for product returns, we regularly rev iew the supply lev els of our significant products at the major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by rev iewing periodic inv entory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and av ailable prescription v olume information for our products, or alternativ e approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inv entory lev els at an av erage of approximately one month or less. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements prov ides us with data on inv entory lev els at our wholesalers; howev er, our data on inv entory lev els in the retail channel is more limited. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activ ity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.\n- Actual U.S. product returns hav e been less than 1 percent of our U.S. rev enue during each of the past three years and hav e not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of rev enue, although fluctuations are more likely in periods following loss of patent exclusiv ity for major products in the U.S. market.\n\n## Adjustments to Revenue\n\nAdjustments to rev enue recognized as a result of changes in estimates for our most significant U.S. sales returns, rebates, and discounts liability balances for products shipped in prev ious periods were less than 3 percent of U.S. rev enue during the year ended December 31, 2024, and less than 1 percent of U.S. rev enue during each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collaboration and Other Arrangements\n\nWe recognize several types of rev enue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately below and more specifically in Note 4 for each of our significant collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other arrangements are ev aluated to determine if the arrangements in their entirety, or contain aspects that, are contracts with customers.\n\n- Revenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product rev enue at the earlier of when control of the asset transfers to the other party or when the product has no alternativ e use to us and we hav e right to payment.\n- Profit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized as collaboration and other rev enue as earned.\n- Royalty rev enue from licensees and certain of our collaboration partners, which is based on sales to third parties of licensed products and technology, is recorded when the third-party sale occurs and the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

We do this by:\n\n- investing billions of dollars annually in R&amp;D;\n- pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;\n- developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;\n- partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;\n- providing patient support and education programs;\n- helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and\n- working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and in which patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.\n\nSee  Item  1A.  Risk  FactorsOur sales  depend  on  coverage  and  reimbursement  from  government  and  commercial  third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability and Item 1A. Risk FactorsGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\n\n## Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nWe  believe  we  are  a  leader  in  the  manufacture  of  biologics  and  that  our  manufacturing  capabilities  represent  a  competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial  manufacturing  processes.  Further,  our  expertise  in  the  manufacture  of  biologics  positions  us  well  for  leadership  in  the global biosimilars market. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties.\n\nWe  have  been  innovating  our  manufacturing  facilities  designed  to  extend  our  manufacturing  advantage  by  optimizing  our manufacturing  network  and/or  by  mitigating  risks  while  continuing  to  ensure  adequate  supply  of  our  products.  For  example,  our licensed next-generation biomanufacturing plant operating in Singapore, and our recently FDA approved facility in West Greenwich, Rhode  Island,  incorporate  multiple  innovative  technologies  into  a  single  facility.  Next-generation  biomanufacturing  plants  require smaller  manufacturing  footprints  and  offer  greater  environmental  benefits,  including  reduced  consumption  of  water  and  energy  and lower levels  of  carbon  emissions. Within  such  plants,  the  equipment  is  portable  and  smaller,  which  provides  greater  flexibility  and speed in the manufacture of different medicines simultaneously. This enables Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility. The Singapore site also has a plant that has been approved by several agencies, including the FDA and EMA, to produce small molecule drugs for commercial manufacturing.\n\nOur  internal  manufacturing  network  has  commercial  production  capabilities  for  bulk  manufacturing,  formulation,  fill,  finish, tableting and device assembly. These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland, Netherlands and Singapore facilities. In addition, we use thirdparty contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network.\n\nTo support our clinical trials, we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California facilities. We also use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our overall clinical manufacturing network.\n\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products.",

For example, a great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise, which is a key component of our liposomal technology, is not covered by patents but is instead protected as a trade secret. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property. We cannot be certain that these parties will comply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets, internal know-how or technological innovation will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Under some of our R&amp;D agreements, inventions become jointly owned by us and our corporate partners and in other cases become the exclusive property of one party. In certain circumstances, it can be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention and disputes could arise regarding those inventions. If our trade secrets or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitors, or if we enter into disputes over ownership of inventions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## Manufacturing and Raw Materials\n\nOur products  are  manufactured  either  at  our  own  facilities  or  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers.  We  depend  on  third parties to perform manufacturing activities for the majority of our API and drug products. For most of our products, including our HIV and HCV products, we use multiple third-party contract manufacturers so that we have primary and back-up suppliers and manufacturing sites. For our cell therapy products, we have established clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities for cell processing activities. For our future products, we continue to develop additional manufacturing capabilities and establish additional third-party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any product that is approved for commercial sale.\n\n## Our Manufacturing Facilities\n\nWe  own  or  lease  manufacturing  facilities  to  manufacture  and  distribute  certain  products  and  API  for  clinical  and/or commercial uses. These facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research and formulation development activities, manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials and oversee our third-party contract manufacturers.\n- San  Dimas  and  La  Verne,  California:  We  manufacture  AmBisome  and  also  package  and  label  the  majority  of  our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and Pacific Rim.\n- Oceanside,  California:  We  utilize  the  facility  for  clinical  manufacturing  and  process  development  of  our  biologics candidates.\n- El  Segundo,  California:  We  utilize  the  facility  for  clinical  and  commercial  manufacturing  and  processing  of  our  cell therapy products.\n- Frederick, Maryland: We utilize the facility for clinical manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Morris Plains, New Jersey: We utilize the facility for manufacturing for monoclonal antibody intermediate and process optimization of our antibody drug conjugate products.\n- Cork  and  Dublin,  Ireland:  We  utilize  the  Cork  facility  for  commercial  manufacturing,  packaging  and  labeling  of  our products. We also perform quality control testing, labeling, packaging and final release of many of our products at the Cork facility, which are distributed to the European Union and other international markets through our facility in Dublin. We utilize our other facility in central Dublin as a drug development hub for our pediatric programs where we perform clinical development, safety, quality, biostatistics and data sciences, regulatory and compliance functions.\n- Edmonton,  Canada:  We  conduct  process  chemistry  research  and  scale-up  activities  for  our  clinical  development candidates,  manufacture  API  for  both  investigational  and  commercial  products  and  conduct  chemical  development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes.\n- Hoofddorp, Netherlands: We utilize the facility for commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.",

      "answer": "Amgen expands its product commercialization globally by acquiring existing third-party businesses or product rights, as seen in its expansion into markets like China, Japan, and Latin America. This strategy allows Amgen to integrate new capabilities and products directly. In contrast, Gilead focuses on strategic collaborations and equity investments in third-party companies, which include non-refundable upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalty arrangements. These investments allow Gilead to co-develop and co-commercialize products without full acquisition, preserving flexibility and sharing risk.

In recent years, we have expanded the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including China and Japan and other parts of Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. This expansion has occurred, and is expected to continue to occur, by establishing our own  affiliates,  by  acquiring  existing  third-party  businesses  or  product  rights  or  by  collaborating  with  third  parties.  See  Business Relationships for our significant alliances. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third party's services varies across these  markets.  Such  use  typically  depends  on  several  factors,  including  the  nature  of  entry  into  the  new  market,  the  size  of  an opportunity and operational capabilities. Together with our collaborators, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.\n\nIn the United States, substantially all of our sales are to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products through direct-to-consumer channels, including print, television  and  online  media.  For  further  discussion,  see  Government  Regulation-Regulation  in  the  United  States-Regulation  of Product  Marketing  and  Promotion.  Outside  the  United  States,  we  sell  principally  to  healthcare  providers  and/or  pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. In the Asia Pacific region, we also sell our products in partnership with other companies, including BeiGene, Daiichi Sankyo, KKC and Takeda.\n\nOur product sales to three large wholesalers, McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years 2021, 2020 and 2019. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for 82%, 83% and 81% of worldwide gross revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Further, HHS's September 2021 comprehensive plan to address drug pricing included potential future mandatory models that link payment for prescription drugs and biologics to factors such as: improved patient outcomes, reductions in health disparities, patient affordability and lower overall costs; bundled payment models; total cost of care models; models in which Medicare Part B savings from utilization of biosimilars, generics, or other high-value products are shared between prescribing providers and the government; additional Medicare Part  D  cost-sharing  support  for  biosimilars  and  generics;  and  potential  expansion  of  the  Part  D  Senior  Savings  Model  to  additional classes  of  drugs.  CMS  also  recently  proposed  a  national  coverage  determination  for  Medicare  which  limits  coverage  of  certain Alzheimer's disease medications approved by the FDA only to patients in qualifying clinical trials, suggesting that regulatory approval does not necessarily result in full Medicare coverage. In this dynamic environment, particularly in light of the pressures on healthcare budgets as a result of the pandemic, we are unable to predict which or how many federal policy, legislative, regulatory, executive or administrative  changes  may  ultimately  be,  or  effectively  estimate  the  consequences  to  our  business  if,  enacted  and  implemented. However, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing  of  or  otherwise  reduce  the  use  of  our  U.S.  products,  or  limit  our  ability  to  offer  co-pay  payment  assistance  to  commercial patients, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe also  face  risks  relating  to  the  reporting  of  pricing  data  that  affects  the  reimbursement  of  and  discounts  provided  for  our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a biopharmaceutical manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. CMS finalized a rule in December 2020 providing that, starting January 1, 2023, unless a manufacturer can ensure that the full amount of manufacturer patient assistance programs is passed on to the patient, such amount will be treated as a price reduction that will be taken into account when reporting our Best Price and/or Average Manufacturer Price. Given the use by PBMs and insurers of copay accumulator adjustment programs to apply such patient assistance for the benefit of such companies and not to defray costs to patients, it could be difficult to impossible for manufacturers to ensure that the full value of such amounts is being passed on to the patient. This new  policy,  if  implemented,  would  have  significant  implications  for  our  ability  to  offer  copay  assistance  programs.  Although implementation has been delayed by the current Administration, the prior Administration finalized a rule (which was to be effective January 1, 2022) mandating price and cost-sharing transparency for almost all health plans and insurers in the individual and group commercial  markets.  Additionally,  the  Administration  recently  finalized  transparency  provisions  required  under  the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 for health plans and insurer reporting of certain drug pricing information by December 27, 2022, and each June  thereafter,  resulting  in  a  biennial  public  report  highlighting  drug  pricing  trends  and  the  impact  of  prescription  drug  costs  on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. It is unclear how group health plans and health insurers may respond.\n\n-Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively  affected,  and  may  continue  to  negatively affect, access to, and have affected, and may continue to affect, sales of our products\n\nAt the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create  additional  pressure  on  our  pricing  decisions. A  number  of  states  have  adopted,  and  many  other  states  are  considering,  drug importation programs or other new pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers publicly to report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. For  example,  a  California  law,  the constitutionality of which  is  currently being  challenged,  purports  to  require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Similar laws exist in Oregon and Washington. States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. California adopted a 2020-21 budget that incorporates international pricing  into  Medicaid  supplemental  rebate  negotiations  and  allows  its  Medicaid  program  to  seek  federal  approval  to  extend supplemental rebates to non-Medicaid populations. New York, Massachusetts and Ohio have established Medicaid drug spending caps, and additional states may consider doing so as they face budget deficits from the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont have enacted laws, and several other states have proposed laws, to facilitate the importation of drugs from Canada. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.",

In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, laws and regulations relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and  state  programs,  the  Medicaid  Rebate  Statute,  laws  that  regulate  written  and  verbal  communications  about  our  products, individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of health information. Actual or alleged violations of these laws or any related regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, civil monetary  penalties,  exclusion  from  participation  in  federal  and  state  health  care  programs,  including  Medicare,  Medicaid  and Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense health programs, actions against executives overseeing our business and significant remediation measures, negative publicity or other consequences. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to changing and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices. The resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material.\n\nIn addition, government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, and we are continually assessing the methods by which we calculate and report pricing in accordance with these obligations. Our methodologies for calculations are inherently subjective  and  may  be  subject  to  review  and  challenge  by  various  government  agencies,  which  may  disagree  with  our interpretation.  If  the  government  disagrees  with  our  reported  calculations,  we  may  need  to  restate  previously  reported  data  and could be subject to additional financial and legal liability.\n\nThere also continues to be enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs, and manufacturer donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by  governments  on  reimbursement  and  other  patient  support  offerings,  clinical  education  programs  and  promotional  speaker programs. If we, or our agents and vendors, are deemed to have failed to comply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any  of  these  areas,  we  could  be  subject  to  criminal  or  civil  sanctions.  Any  similar  violations  by  our  competitors  could  also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products.\n\nFor a description of our government investigations and related litigation, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## We are subject to risks if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates.\n\nAs additional studies are conducted subsequent to obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over  longer  periods  of  time  by  many  patients,  including  patients  with  underlying  health  problems  or  patients  taking  other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety, resistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed indications, or to halt sales of a product.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  have  been  moving  towards  more  active  and  transparent  pharmacovigilance  and  are  making  greater amounts of stand-alone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through websites and other means, such  as  periodic  safety  update  report  summaries,  risk  management  plan  summaries  and  various  adverse  event  data.

      "question": "How does Amgen's reliance on third-party contract manufacturers, as exemplified by past shortages like EPOGEN glass vials, compare with Gilead's strategy of using multiple third-party manufacturers to ensure supply continuity for its HIV and HCV products?",
      "answer": "Amgen has experienced supply chain disruptions due to reliance on third-party manufacturers, such as the past shortages of EPOGEN glass vials, which led to delayed shipments and supply constraints. In contrast, Gilead mitigates manufacturing risks by using multiple third-party contract manufacturers for its HIV and HCV products, ensuring primary and backup suppliers are in place to maintain uninterrupted supply. This difference in approach highlights how Gilead's diversified supplier strategy may reduce the risk of product shortages compared to Amgen's historical challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Amgen has faced supply chain disruptions due to third-party manufacturing issues, specifically citing EPOGEN glass vial shortages.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Gilead uses multiple third-party manufacturers for its HIV and HCV products to ensure supply continuity with primary and backup suppliers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two strategies \u2014 Amgen's vulnerability to supply chain issues contrasts with Gilead's diversified approach aimed at minimizing such risks."

Further  quality  issues  that  result  in  unexpected  additional  demand  for  certain components have resulted in shortages, and in the future may lead to shortages, of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply  constraints,  clinical  trial  delays,  contract  disputes  and/or  stock-outs  of  our  products.  These  or  other  similar  events  could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n\nManufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n\nManufacturing  biologic  and  small  molecule  human  therapeutic  products  is  difficult,  complex  and  highly  regulated.  We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally.  In  addition,  we  currently  use  third-party  contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. BusinessManufacturing,  Distribution  and  Raw  Materials-Manufacturing.  Our  ability  to  adequately  and  timely  manufacture  and  supply  our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by:\n\n- capacity of manufacturing facilities;\n- contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;\n- natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;\n- labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) or natural disasters;\n- compliance with regulatory requirements;\n- changes in forecasts of future demand;\n- timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;\n- updates of manufacturing specifications;\n- contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;\n- timing and outcome of product quality testing;\n- power failures and/or other utility failures;\n- cyberattacks on supplier systems;\n- breakdown,  failure,  substandard  performance  or  improper  installation  or  operation  of  equipment  (including  our  information technology  systems  and  network-connected  control  systems  or  those  of  our  contract  manufacturers  or  third-party  service providers); and/or\n- delays  in  the  ability  of  the  FDA  or  foreign  regulatory  agencies  to  provide  us  necessary  reviews,  inspections  and  approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal or other government shutdowns.\n\nIf  any  of  these  or  other  problems  affect  production  in  one  or  more  of  our  facilities  or  those  of  our  third-party  contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in",

For example, a great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise, which is a key component of our liposomal technology, is not covered by patents but is instead protected as a trade secret. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property. We cannot be certain that these parties will comply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets, internal know-how or technological innovation will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Under some of our R&amp;D agreements, inventions become jointly owned by us and our corporate partners and in other cases become the exclusive property of one party. In certain circumstances, it can be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention and disputes could arise regarding those inventions. If our trade secrets or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitors, or if we enter into disputes over ownership of inventions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## Manufacturing and Raw Materials\n\nOur products  are  manufactured  either  at  our  own  facilities  or  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers.  We  depend  on  third parties to perform manufacturing activities for the majority of our API and drug products. For most of our products, including our HIV and HCV products, we use multiple third-party contract manufacturers so that we have primary and back-up suppliers and manufacturing sites. For our cell therapy products, we have established clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities for cell processing activities. For our future products, we continue to develop additional manufacturing capabilities and establish additional third-party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any product that is approved for commercial sale.\n\n## Our Manufacturing Facilities\n\nWe  own  or  lease  manufacturing  facilities  to  manufacture  and  distribute  certain  products  and  API  for  clinical  and/or commercial uses. These facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research and formulation development activities, manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials and oversee our third-party contract manufacturers.\n- San  Dimas  and  La  Verne,  California:  We  manufacture  AmBisome  and  also  package  and  label  the  majority  of  our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and Pacific Rim.\n- Oceanside,  California:  We  utilize  the  facility  for  clinical  manufacturing  and  process  development  of  our  biologics candidates.\n- El  Segundo,  California:  We  utilize  the  facility  for  clinical  and  commercial  manufacturing  and  processing  of  our  cell therapy products.\n- Frederick, Maryland: We utilize the facility for clinical manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Morris Plains, New Jersey: We utilize the facility for manufacturing for monoclonal antibody intermediate and process optimization of our antibody drug conjugate products.\n- Cork  and  Dublin,  Ireland:  We  utilize  the  Cork  facility  for  commercial  manufacturing,  packaging  and  labeling  of  our products. We also perform quality control testing, labeling, packaging and final release of many of our products at the Cork facility, which are distributed to the European Union and other international markets through our facility in Dublin. We utilize our other facility in central Dublin as a drug development hub for our pediatric programs where we perform clinical development, safety, quality, biostatistics and data sciences, regulatory and compliance functions.\n- Edmonton,  Canada:  We  conduct  process  chemistry  research  and  scale-up  activities  for  our  clinical  development candidates,  manufacture  API  for  both  investigational  and  commercial  products  and  conduct  chemical  development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes.\n- Hoofddorp, Netherlands: We utilize the facility for commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.",

      "question": "How did Reblozyl's U.S. revenue growth in 2023 reflect the financial contributions and strategic positioning of its co-developers, considering BMY's reported increase and MRK's alliance revenue?",
      "answer": "Reblozyl's U.S. revenue growth of 37% in 2023, as reported by BMY, indicates strong demand for the drug, which directly benefits its co-developer MRK through alliance revenue. MRK reported $168 million in U.S. alliance revenue from Reblozyl in 2023, showing that BMY's successful commercialization efforts translated into direct financial gains for MRK. This interdependence highlights how BMY's market execution and demand generation for Reblozyl positively impacted MRK's revenue stream through their collaborative arrangement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BMY reported a 37% increase in U.S. revenues for Reblozyl in 2023 due to higher demand.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - MRK reported $168 million in U.S. alliance revenue from Reblozyl in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BMY's strong U.S. performance for Reblozyl directly contributed to MRK's alliance revenue, demonstrating a clear financial linkage and strategic interdependence between the two companies through their co-development partnership."

      "question": "What specific regulatory approval milestone for Reblozyl, announced by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2023, likely contributed to Merck's 2023 alliance revenue, and how does this compare to Merck's 2022 revenue from Reblozyl-related payments?",
      "answer": "The specific regulatory approval milestone for Reblozyl that likely contributed to Merck's 2023 alliance revenue was the FDA approval in August 2023 for treating anemia in ESA-na\u00efve adult patients with lower-risk MDS who may require regular red blood cell transfusions. This approval, as part of the Reblozyl development timeline, likely triggered a milestone payment to Merck in 2023. In comparison, Merck received a payment in 2022 related to a regulatory approval milestone for Reblozyl, as noted in its 2023 10-K filing. While the exact dollar amounts of these payments are not disclosed, the 2023 payment represents revenue from royalties and milestone achievements, similar to the 2022 payment, which was also tied to regulatory progress.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Bristol-Myers Squibb announced FDA approval of Reblozyl in August 2023 for treating anemia in ESA-na\u00efve adult patients with lower-risk MDS who may require regular red blood cell transfusions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Merck's 2023 alliance revenue for Reblozyl includes royalties and milestone payments, with the 2022 payment specifically tied to a regulatory approval milestone.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The FDA approval of Reblozyl in August 2023 likely triggered a milestone payment to Merck in 2023, contributing to its alliance revenue for that year. This follows a similar pattern to the 2022 payment, which was also linked to a regulatory milestone for Reblozyl, although the specific approval tied to the 2022 payment is not detailed in the provided evidence."

      "question": "Given Merck's 2023 global alliance revenue of $212 million from Reblozyl and Bristol-Myers Squibb's strategic focus on expanding the drug into new indications, how does BMY's clinical development plan for Reblozyl create potential upside for Merck's future revenue from this partnership?",
      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb is advancing Reblozyl into new indications with an ongoing registrational trial for chronic anemia associated with myelofibrosis, which could significantly expand the drug's market potential. This aligns with BMY's broader strategy to renew and diversify its portfolio and expand treatment options across different diseases. For Merck, which reported $212 million in alliance revenue from Reblozyl in 2023, the successful expansion of the drug into additional indications could drive increased sales and, consequently, higher alliance revenue in future periods.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source B - Merck reported $212 million in alliance revenue from Reblozyl in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - Bristol-Myers Squibb is advancing Reblozyl into new indications, specifically chronic anemia associated with myelofibrosis, as part of its broader pipeline expansion strategy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BMY's clinical development and commercialization strategy for Reblozyl, including expansion into new indications, has the potential to grow the drug\u2019s market and increase future alliance revenue for Merck."

      "question": "How does the IRA's implementation affect both Eli Lilly's pricing strategy for Jardiance and Pfizer's overall drug development and commercialization strategy, given the specific discount applied to Jardiance and the anticipated regulatory pressures described by Pfizer?",
      "answer": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) significantly affects both Eli Lilly and Pfizer by altering pricing strategies and increasing regulatory pressures. For Eli Lilly, the IRA's implementation led to a government-set price for Jardiance under Medicare, resulting in a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price. This substantial discount directly impacts Eli Lilly's revenue from Jardiance, which could accelerate revenue erosion and negatively affect its consolidated results of operations. For Pfizer, the IRA\u2019s implementation is described as introducing regulatory and pricing pressures that may influence both Medicare and commercial markets. Pfizer anticipates that commercial payers may follow Medicare\u2019s lead in setting payment rates, which could lead to broader cost containment measures and reduced reimbursement rates across the industry. Therefore, the IRA\u2019s pricing mechanism for Jardiance forces Eli Lilly to reassess its pricing and profitability assumptions, while Pfizer must adapt its drug development and commercialization strategies in anticipation of similar pricing pressures and regulatory shifts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Eli Lilly's Jardiance is subject to a 66% discount under the IRA starting in 2026, which will significantly impact its revenue and results of operations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Pfizer notes that the IRA is being implemented through government guidance and that its effects on Medicare and commercial markets are evolving, prompting ongoing evaluation of potential business impacts.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face strategic challenges due to the IRA: Eli Lilly experiences direct revenue loss from Jardiance's mandated discount, while Pfizer must adjust development and commercialization plans in anticipation of similar pricing constraints and payer behavior influenced by Medicare policy."

Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or div erted drugs sold under our brand name, which may also impact our business and financial results.\n\nIn addition, we rely on our ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled scientific, technical, management, and other personnel in order to compete effectiv ely. To continue to commercialize our products, and adv ance the research, dev elopment, and commercialization of additional modalities, indications, and product candidates, we hav e expanded, and will likely need to further expand, our workforce, both in and outside the U.S. We continue to face intense competition for qualified indiv iduals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic and other research institutions, as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities, which has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our failure to compete effectiv ely for talent could negativ ely affect sales of our current and any future approved products and indications, and could result in material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to our business.\n\n- Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation or business.\n\nPublic and priv ate payers continue to take aggressiv e steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medicines. These pressures hav e negativ ely affected, and we expect will continue to negativ ely affect, our consolidated results of operations. Gov ernments and priv ate payers worldwide hav e intensified their scrutiny of, and actions intended to address, pricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical products and are demanding greater commercial and clinical v alue from pharmaceutical companies in the form of strong product differentiation and demonstrated v alue. We continue to experience scrutiny on the pricing of current and potential diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease products due to payer concern ov er projected growth in these markets and, for certain of these drugs, the anticipated duration of treatment. We hav e also observ ed scrutiny of pricing and access disparities across jurisdictions.\n\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including because of the regulatory priorities of the U.S. executiv e branch and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, in August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices in Medicare effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the gov ernment-set prices for these first ten medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. Within the U.S., state lev el transparency initiativ es, importation rules, reporting requirements, and mandated programs, including the establishment of drug affordability boards with the power to set upper payment limits on certain drugs in state-regulated plans, hav e also increased administrativ e costs, in some cases, compromised confidential business practices and otherwise detrimentally impacted our business. Certain states hav e also undertaken efforts to codify 340B contract pharmacies into statute or impose other state law mandates, which increase the cost of 340B programs. To date, sev eral states hav e passed contract pharmacy legislation, which hav e been subject to v arious legal challenges. For more details, see Item 1, \"Business-Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access.\"\n\nFurther, restrictiv e or unfav orable pricing, cov erage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by gov ernments, regulatory agencies, courts, or priv ate payers, including in relation to the implementation of the IRA, reference pricing, and compulsory licensing, may adversely impact our business and financial results. We continue to experience additional pricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting from periods of unev en economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts.",

In addition, with the E uropean R egulation on H ealth T echnology Assessm ent (E U  H T A-R ) taking effect in January 2025, we are engaging and m onitoring application of the E U 's new clinical assessm ent program  to new oncology products and certain biologic products subm itted to the E M A. F or additional inform ation regarding these governm ent initiatives, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.

In addition, in m any countries, with respect to our vaccines, we participate in a tender process for selection in national im m unization program s. F ailure to win national im m unization tenders or to obtain acceptable pricing, as well as recent entry of additional com petitors, could adversely affect our business.\n\n## U.S. H E ALTH CAR E  R E G U LATIO N\n\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Any significant additional efforts at the U .S. federal or state levels to reform  the healthcare system  by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a m aterial im pact on us. F or additional inform ation on U .S. healthcare regulation, see the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints section. O ther U .S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, am ong others, general budget control actions, changes in patent laws, the im portation of prescription drugs to the U .S. at prices that are regulated by foreign governm ents, revisions to reim bursem ent of biopharm aceuticals under governm ent program s that could reference international prices or require new discounts, lim itations on interactions with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders, restrictions on pharm aceutical advertising, or the use of com parative effectiveness m ethodologies that could be im plem ented in a m anner that focuses prim arily on cost differences and m inim izes the therapeutic differences am ong pharm aceutical products and restricts access to innovative m edicines. In addition, we m ay face increased risks to, am ong other things, our business, revenue, earnings, reputation or financial guidance, as a result of potential changes to vaccine or other healthcare policy in the U .S.\n\nAny additional reduction of U .S. federal spending on entitlem ent program s beyond the IR A, including M edicare, M edicaid, or any other publicly funded or subsidized health program s, and the 340B P rogram , m ay affect paym ent for our products or services provided using our products. Any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting M edicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health program s that m ay be im plem ented could have an adverse im pact on our results of operations. T he IR A is being im plem ented largely through governm ent guidance and as its effect on M edicare and com m ercial m arkets evolve, we will continue to evaluate the potential im pacts to our business.\n\nWe expect additional drug cost containm ent efforts at both the federal and state levels. F urther, com m ercial payors often follow M edicare coverage policy and paym ent lim itations when setting their own paym ent rates. Any reduction in cost or other containm ent m easures m ay sim ilarly be adopted by com m ercial plans. C overage policies and reim bursem ent rates for com m ercial plans m ay change at any tim e. E ven if favorable coverage and reim bursem ent status is attained for one or m ore products, less favorable coverage policies and reim bursem ent rates m ay be im plem ented in the future.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT, RE GULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKE TING OF PRODUCTS\n\nThe discovery and developm ent of drugs, vaccines and biological products are tim e consum ing, costly and unpredictable. T he outcom e is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk due to the following factors, am ong others:\n\n- The process from  early discovery to design and adequate im plem entation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take m any years and have high costs.\n- We may have difficulties recruiting and enrolling patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis.\n- Product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process, including as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, or unfavorable new pre-clinical or clinical data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical or clinical data, including results that m ay not support further clinical developm ent of the product candidate or indication.\n- We may need to am end our clinical trial protocols or conduct additional clinical trials under certain circum stances, for exam ple, to further assess appropriate dosage or collect additional safety data.\n- We may not be able to m eet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, com m encem ent and/or com pletion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory subm ission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates.\n- We may not be able to successfully address all the com m ents received from  regulatory authorities such as the F D A and the E M A, or be able to obtain approval for new products and indications from  regulators.\n\nRegulatory approvals of our products depend on m yriad factors, including regulatory determ inations as to the product's safety and efficacy. In the context of public health emergencies like the C O VID -19 pandem ic, regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for m arketing authorization on an em ergency or conditional basis. Additionally, clinical trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessm ents by regulatory authorities. As a result of regulatory interpretations and assessm ents or other developm ents that m ay occur during the review process, or even after a product is authorized or approved for m arketing, a product's com m ercial potential could be adversely affected by potential em erging concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or im pacting the scope of indicated patient populations, labeling or m arketing, manufacturing processes, safety issues and/or other m atters, including decisions relating to em erging developm ents regarding potential product im purities. Also, certain of our products have received and m ay in the future receive approvals under accelerated approval pathways where continued approval m ay be contingent upon confirm atory studies demonstrating the anticipated clinical benefit and/or safety profile.\n\nWe may not be able to receive or m aintain favorable recom m endations by technical or advisory com m ittees, such as the AC IP  or an F D A Advisory C om m ittee, which m ay im pact the availability or com m ercial potential of our products and product candidates. F urther, claim s and concerns that m ay arise regarding the safety and/or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can negatively im pact current or future product sales, as applicable, and potentially lead to regulator-directed risk evaluations and assessm ents, asset im pairm ents, and/or consum er fraud, product liability and other litigation and claim s, as well as product recalls or withdrawals, including our voluntary withdrawal of all lots of O xbrtya in all m arkets where it is approved, and any regulatory or other im pact on O xbryta or other sickle cell disease assets. R egulatory requirem ents m ay also result in a m ore challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for, am ong other things, additional or m ore extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval, or increased post-approval requirem ents. For these and other reasons discussed in this Risk Factors section, we m ay not obtain the approvals we expect within the tim efram e we anticipate, or at all.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n19",

Business dev elopment transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all), may not result in successful dev elopment outcomes or successful commercialization of any product, may giv e rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny, and may result in charges that negativ ely impact our financial position or results of operations in any giv en period.\n\nSee Item 1, \"Business-Research and Development-Phases of New Drug Development,\" Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and AnalysisExecutive Overv iew-Clinical Dev elopment Pipeline\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 6: Inv entories,\" for more details about our current product pipeline.\n\n## \u00b7 We and our products face intense competition, including from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies and, in many cases, our products compete against the leading products of one or more of our competitors. To compete successfully, we must continue to deliv er innov ativ e, cost-effectiv e products through internal innov ation or business dev elopment that meet important medical needs, prov ide improved outcomes and a positiv e consumer experience for patients, and deliv er v alue to payers. Our product rev enues and prospects are adv ersely affected by patient access issues, the introduction by competitors of branded products that are first to market, hav e better marketplace access, have greater brand recognition or are perceiv ed as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar v ersions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar v ersions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. Our rev enues are also adv ersely affected by treatment innov ations, including new or superior modalities, that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our existing products, and our existing products could be subject to decreased sales v olumes, realized price reductions, or both. In some cases, the introduction of our own innov ativ e products results in these adv erse impacts for our preexisting products.\n\nRegulation of generic and biosimilar products v aries around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for biosimilars, health authority guidelines and legislativ e actions could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentiv ize uptake of biosimilars. Giv en the importance to us of marketed biologic products and those in our clinical-stage pipeline, such regulation could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business. See Item 1, \"Business-Competition\" and \"Business-Research and Development,\" for more details. Alternativ ely, actual or perceiv ed failure of robust generic and biosimilar competition could propel gov ernments to adopt additional policies and legislation that threaten our intellectual property, pricing of our products, or other aspects of our business.\n\nOur success depends on a market that is observ ant of intellectual property rights and regulatory requirements. Dev elopments that undermine that landscape can significantly impact our business and reputation. For example, we hav e seen an increase in the production, marketing, and sale of counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded incretins that could materially impact us. Our actions intended to stop or prev ent illegal sales of such medicines may be costly or ineffectiv e. See Item 1, \"Business-Gov ernment Regulation of Our Operations and Products,\" for additional information on market risks related to counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded medicines.

In conducting clinical trials, we m ay depend on contract research organizations to handle regulatory filings, m onitor site perform ance and raise potential quality m atters relating to clinical trials.

Further, our revenues will be adversely affected by the term ination or expiration of collaboration and co-prom otion agreem ents that we have entered into and that we m ay enter into from  tim e to tim e.\n\n## COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS\n\nOur reputation, in-line and pipeline portfolios render our m edicines and vaccines prim e targets for counterfeiters. C ounterfeits pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are m anufactured-often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected, and unsanitary sites-as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to m itigate this threat could adversely im pact consum ers who use our products, potentially causing them  harm . T his situation, in turn, m ay result in the loss of patient confidence in the P fizer nam e and in the integrity of our m edicines and vaccines, and potentially im pact our business through lost sales, product recalls, and possible litigation. T he prevalence of counterfeit m edicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-com m erce. As consum ers increasingly turn to the internet as a source for m any products including m edicines, they are at the sam e tim e increasingly exposed to fake m edicines via the internet as crim inals increasingly distribute counterfeit and substandard m edicines through 'rogue' online pharm acies. The internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scam s that target unsuspecting consum ers. Traffic to these generally deceptive pharm acy sites is largely driven by m isplaced trust in sophisticated internet retailers and social m edia offers coupled with the convenience e-com m erce affords consum ers. C ounterfeiters generally target any m edicine or vaccine boasting strong dem and and we have observed heightened counterfeit and fraud attem pts to our internal m edicine portfolio, as well as products utilized in the treatm ent of C O VID -19.\n\nWe consistently invest in an enterprise-wide strategy to aggressively com bat counterfeit threats by educating patients and healthcare providers about the risks, investing in innovative technologies to detect and disrupt sophisticated internet offers and scam s, proactively m onitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcem ent, and advising legislators and regulators. H owever, our efforts and those of others m ay not be entirely successful, and the presence of counterfeit m edicines m ay continue to increase.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO G OVERNMENT REG ULATION AND LEG AL PROCEEDING S:\n\n## PRICING AND RE IMB U R SE ME N T\n\nOur future results could be adversely affected by changes in U .S. and international governm ental regulations that m andate price controls, create coverage criteria, or lim it patient access to our products. In addition to the expansion of price controls in the U .S. in the IR A, the adoption of m ore restrictive coverage policies and price controls in new and existing jurisdictions, or the failure to obtain or m aintain coverage and pricing could also adversely im pact revenue. W e expect pricing pressures and other cost containm ent m easures for drugs and vaccines will continue.\n\nI n the U .S., pharm aceutical product pricing is subject to governm ent and public scrutiny and calls for reform , and m any of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a result. W e expect to see continued focus by the U .S. governm ent on regulating pricing and access to m edicine. F or exam ple, the drug pricing provisions of the IR A are being im plem ented over the next several years. T he IR A directs H H S to set the prices of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under M edicare. T he IR A also im poses rebates under M edicare P art B and M edicare P art D  which require m anufacturers to pay rebates if price increases outpace inflation relative to a benchm ark period, and replaces the M edicare P art D  coverage gap discount program  with a new discounting program . T he drug pricing provisions of the IR A began to be im plem ented in 2022 and im plem entation efforts will continue in com ing years. In August 2023, C M S published the first ten m edicines subject to the M D P N P , which included E liquis. In August 2024, the governm ent released the new M edicare price for E liquis, which will becom e effective January 1, 2026. O n January 17, 2025, C M S announced the selection of another 15 drugs from Medicare P art D  for the m axim um  fair price, with prices to be set and effective on January 1, 2027. Ibrance and Xtandi were included in the list of 15 drugs selected. Another 15 drugs from  M edicare P art B or M edicare P art D  will be selected by F ebruary 1, 2026, for the m axim um  price to be set and in effect by January 1, 2028. It is possible that m ore of our products could be selected in future years, which could, am ong other things, lead to lower revenues prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. H ealth plans m ay also require rebates in addition to the m axim um  fair price for preferred placem ent on a M edicare plan form ulary. T he M D P N P  is currently subject to legal challenges and therefore, the outcom e rem ains uncertain. W e continue to evaluate the im pact of the IR A on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IR A on our business and the pharm aceutical industry rem ains uncertain. F or additional inform ation, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.\n\nPayors m ay give preference to generic drugs and biosim ilars m ore aggressively to generate savings and attem pt to stim ulate additional price com petition. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration am ong pharm acy chains, wholesalers and P BM s will increase pricing pressures in the industry. Som e states have im plem ented, and others are considering, patient access constraints or cost cutting under state regulated program s including the M edicaid program . States have continued to focus on addressing drug costs, generally by increasing price transparency or attem pting to lim it drug price increases for state-regulated insurance. M easures to regulate prices or paym ent for pharm aceutical products, including legislation on drug im portation and prescription drug affordability boards (P D ABs) that seek to im pose reim bursem ent lim its for certain drugs, could adversely affect our business. For additional inform ation on U .S. pricing and reim bursem ent, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.\n\nWe encounter sim ilar regulatory and legislative issues in m ost other countries in which we operate. In certain m arkets, such as in E U  m em ber states, the U .K., Japan, C hina, C anada, Australia and N ew Zealand, governm ents have significant power as large single payors to regulate prices, access criteria, or im pose other m eans of cost control, particularly as a result of recent global financing pressures. F or exam ple, the Q C E  and VBP  tender process in C hina has resulted in significant price cuts for off-patent m edicines. Additionally, in the EU, the E C  proposed the largest reform  of E U  pharm aceutical legislation in 20 years. In April 2024, the E uropean P arliam ent introduced am endm ents to the E C 's proposal. T he E U legislative process rem ains ongoing, with several stages still required before the reform  can receive final approval. T his reform  m ay alter\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n18",

      "answer": "GILD estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and includes assumptions such as expected stock price volatility and expected award life. JNJ also uses the Black-Scholes model but explicitly incorporates the dividend yield as an additional assumption in its valuation process. Differences in these assumptions\u2014particularly volatility and dividend yield\u2014directly influence the calculated fair value of stock options, which in turn affects the reported stock-based compensation expenses on their financial statements. Since GILD does not disclose a dividend yield assumption and JNJ does, and because volatility assumptions may differ implicitly, investors cannot directly compare the two companies' stock-based compensation expenses without accounting for these methodological differences in their valuation models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GILD uses the Black-Scholes model and explicitly mentions expected stock price volatility and expected award life as key assumptions in its valuation process.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The inclusion or exclusion of dividend yield, along with potential differences in volatility assumptions, affects how each company calculates the fair value of stock options, which directly impacts the magnitude of stock-based compensation expense recorded. This affects the comparability of their financial statements for investors analyzing compensation-related costs."

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.\n\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.\n\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.  The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model.

Compensation  expense  is  recognized  on  the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The estimated fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of our common stock. For PSUs, depending on the terms of the award, fair value on the date of grant is determined based on either the Monte Carlo valuation methodology or the closing stock price on the date of grant. For stock option awards, estimated fair value is based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nWe are a party to various legal actions. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue the best estimate of loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a material loss is reasonably possible, we disclose the possible loss or range of loss, or that the amount of loss cannot be estimated at this time.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nOur income tax provision is computed under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of applicable tax laws or regulations.\n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained  upon  examination  by  tax  authorities  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.  The  tax  benefit  recognized  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits ('UTB') is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as  significant  amendments  to  existing  tax  law,  new  regulations  or  interpretations  by  tax  authorities,  new  information  obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTB in Income tax (expense) benefit on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nWe have elected to account for the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as a component of tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred.\n\n## Other Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOur  other  significant  accounting  policies  are  described  in  the  remaining  appropriate  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.",

      "question": "How does the nature and timeline of the government investigations involving Gilead's promotional speaker programs for HIV differ from Johnson & Johnson's experience with Civil Investigative Demands related to pharmacy benefit manager contracts?",
      "answer": "Gilead received a subpoena in 2017 from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York concerning promotional speaker programs for HIV, and the company is still cooperating with the inquiry without any further public developments. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson received a Civil Investigative Demand in March 2016 related to contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers for certain pharmaceutical products, and the company responded by providing documents. While both companies faced investigations under similar regulatory scrutiny, Gilead's case remains ongoing with no resolution timeline, whereas Johnson & Johnson's case had progressed to document production and cooperation by the time of the 2022 filings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Gilead received a subpoena in 2017 regarding promotional speaker programs for HIV and is still cooperating with the inquiry.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Johnson & Johnson received a Civil Investigative Demand in March 2016 concerning pharmacy benefit manager contracts for certain pharmaceutical products and responded by providing documents.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies faced government investigations related to their marketing practices in the healthcare sector, but the timelines and progression of these investigations differ significantly, with Gilead's inquiry still ongoing and J&J's progressing to document production and cooperation."

Plaintiffs allege that Viread, Truvada, Atripla, Complera and/or Stribild caused them to experience kidney, bone and/or tooth injuries. The lawsuits, which are pending in state or federal court in California, Delaware, Maryland, Missouri and New Jersey, involve more than 27,000 plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these actions. While we believe these cases are without merit, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. If plaintiffs are successful in their claims, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages.\n\n## Government Investigation\n\nIn  2017,  we  received  a  subpoena  from  the  U.S.  Attorney's  Office  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York  requesting documents related to our promotional speaker programs for HIV. We are cooperating with this inquiry.\n\n## Qui Tam Litigation\n\nA former sales employee filed a qui tam lawsuit against Gilead in March 2017 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Following the government's decision not to intervene in the suit, the case was unsealed in December 2020. The lawsuit alleges that certain of Gilead's HCV sales and marketing activities violated the federal False Claims Act and various state false claims acts. The relator seeks all available relief under these statutes.\n\nTwo former employees filed a qui tam lawsuit against Gilead in April 2020 in California state court. Following the California Attorney General's Office's decision not to intervene, relators served Gilead with their complaint in August 2020. The complaint alleges violations of the California False Claims Act ('CFCA') and employment law claims. Relators seek all available relief under the CFCA. In December 2021, Gilead and relators executed a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, and in February 2022, the court issued an order dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice. The settlement does not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nHealth Choice Advocates, LLC ('Health Choice') filed a qui tam lawsuit against Gilead in April 2020 in New Jersey state court. Following the New Jersey Attorney General's Office's decision not to intervene in the suit, Health Choice served us with their  original  complaint in August 2020. The lawsuit alleges that Gilead violated the New Jersey False Claims Act through our clinical educator programs for Sovaldi and Harvoni and our HCV and HIV patient access programs. The lawsuit seeks all available relief under the New Jersey False Claims Act. In April 2021, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss with prejudice. Health Choice has appealed the trial court's dismissal.\n\nHealth Choice filed another qui tam lawsuit against Gilead in May 2020 making similar allegations in Texas state court. Following the Texas Attorney General's Office's decision not to intervene in the suit, Health Choice served us with their original complaint in October 2020. The lawsuit alleges that Gilead violated the Texas Medicare Fraud Prevention Act ('TMFPA') through our  clinical  educator  programs  for  Sovaldi  and  Harvoni  and  our  HCV  and  HIV  patient  access  programs. The  lawsuit  seeks  all available relief under the TMFPA. In September 2021, the Texas Court of Appeals for the Sixth Court Appeals District granted our request to stay the Texas litigation. The case is stayed pending final judgment in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania lawsuit filed in March 2017, as discussed above.\n\nWe intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these actions. While we believe these cases are without merit, we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes. If any of these plaintiffs are successful in their claims, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages.\n\n## Securities Litigation\n\nImmunomedics and several of its former officers and directors have been named as defendants in putative class actions filed in 2018 and 2019, which were consolidated in September 2019. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in November 2019 and an amended complaint in July 2021. Plaintiffs allege that Immunomedics and the individual defendants violated the federal securities laws  in  connection  with  Immunomedics'  Biologics  License  Application  for  Trodelvy,  and  seek  certification  of  a  class  of shareholders,  damages  and  other  relief.  The  consolidated  lawsuit  is  pending  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  New Jersey. While we believe this case is without merit, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. If plaintiffs are successful in their claims, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nWe are a party to various legal actions that arose in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that these other legal actions will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated business, financial position or results of operations.",

The demand was issued in connection with an investigation under the False Claims Act. The Company has provided documents in response to the demand.\n\nIn July 2016, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Janssen Products LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False Claims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA  and INTELENCE , and anti-kickback violations in connection with the promotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. The Court denied summary judgment on all claims in December 2021. Daubert motions were granted in part and denied in part in January 2022, and the case is proceeding to trial. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nIn March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc.

In August 2019, the United States Department of Justice notified JBI that it was closing the investigation. Subsequently, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on the Company. The Department of Justice had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is underway. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nIn April and September 2017, Johnson &amp; Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX , OLYSIO , REMICADE , SIMPONI , STELARA  and ZYTIGA . The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services related to those products, as well as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies. The Company has provided documents in response to the subpoenas. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nIn June 2017, Johnson &amp; Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking information regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc.(DePuy) spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of Company subsidiaries with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson &amp; Johnson and DePuy have produced documents in response to the subpoena and are fully cooperating with the government's investigation.\n\nIn July 2018, the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson do Brasil Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio de Produtos para Sa\u00fade Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The Company continues to respond to inquiries regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson &amp; Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.\n\n## GENERAL LITIGATION\n\nIn March and April 2015, over 30 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens patients in a number of courts around the United States against Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, alleging vertical and horizontal conspiracies to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints allege that the manufacturers reached agreements with each other and certain distributors and retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. All of the class action cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint in November 2015. Discovery and pre-trial motion practice are complete. Trial is scheduled to begin in March 2022.\n\nBeginning in September 2017, multiple purported class actions were filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of REMICADE against Johnson &amp; Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) alleging that Janssen has violated federal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies for REMICADE .

If Janssen faces a 20% reduction in Symtuza production due to supply chain disruptions involving third-party suppliers, Gilead's revenue from Symtuza could also decrease by 20%.

Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Revenue Share and Other Revenues\n\nWe also generate revenues from other activities, including revenue share from combination products, royalties for outbound licenses of our intellectual property and other payments received from our collaborations with third-party partners. For example, pursuant to our collaboration with Janssen, we receive revenue share from cobicistat, emtricitabine and TAF that are components of Symtuza (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/TAF), a fixed-dose combination product commercialized by Janssen. We include our revenue share from Symtuza in our Product sales. For a description of our collaborations with Janssen and other partners, see Note 11. Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Commercialization and Distribution\n\nWe have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in more than 35 countries. Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial  teams  promote  our  products  through  direct  field  contact  with  physicians,  hospitals,  clinics  and  other  healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts between the distributor and Gilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the United States exclusively through the wholesale channel. During the year ended  December  31,  2021,  approximately  91%  of  our  product  sales  in  the  United  States  and  approximately  65%  of  our  total worldwide  revenues  were  to  three  large  wholesalers,  AmerisourceBergen  Corporation,  Cardinal  Health,  Inc.  and  McKesson Corporation. We sell and distribute our products in Europe and countries outside the United States where the product is approved, either through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe  operate  in  a  highly  competitive  environment.  We  face  significant  competition  from  global  pharmaceutical  and biotechnology  companies,  specialized  pharmaceutical  firms  and  generic  drug  manufacturers.  Our  products  compete  with  other commercially available products based primarily on efficacy, safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease  of  use,  price,  insurance  and  other  reimbursement  coverage,  distribution  and  marketing.  As  our  products  mature,  pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices. Further, as new branded or generic products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur research and development ('R&amp;D') mission is to discover and develop transformational therapies in areas of high unmet medical need. Our product development efforts are focused primarily in viral diseases, inflammatory diseases and oncology. Our team of research scientists is engaged in the discovery and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to the approval of innovative medicines and therapies that will advance the current standard of care and address unmet medical needs. We intend to continue committing significant resources to internal R&amp;D opportunities and external business development activity to drive innovation and growth of our business.\n\nThe  development  of  product  candidates  and  investigational  therapies  in  our  pipeline  is  subject  to  various  risks  and uncertainties. These  risks  and  uncertainties  include  our  ability  to  enroll  patients  in  clinical  trials,  the  possibility  of  unfavorable results  of  our  clinical  trials,  the  need  to  modify  or  delay  our  clinical  trials,  including  on  account  of  clinical  holds  placed  by regulatory authorities, or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain regulatory approvals. As a result, our product candidates  and  investigational  therapies  may  never  be  successfully  commercialized.  Drug  development  is  inherently  risky,  and many product candidates and investigational therapies fail during the development process.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to invest in and advance our R&amp;D pipeline across our therapeutic areas. Below is a summary of our product candidates that were in Phase 3 or registrational Phase 2 clinical trials or pending marketing authorization review by FDA or European Medicines Agency ('EMA') as of the end of 2021.",

Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured -often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites -as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.\n\nThe industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company's business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Company's employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\n\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Company's future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and impact of variants. Any resurgence in COVID-19 could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\n\nWe also face uncertainties related to our COVID-19 vaccine, including uncertainties related to the risk that our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy, safety and durability; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&amp;D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this 'Risk Factors' section and those incorporated by reference herein, including risks relating to the Company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in laws relating to supply of the Company's products. Given that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company.",

Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## It  is  costly  for  Abbott  to  comply  with  numerous  governmental  regulations  and  to  develop  compliant  products  and  processes,  and  consequences  for  noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nAbbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\n\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval, clearance, or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, postmarket changes to products, advertising, and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott's products, and civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.\n\nThese actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy any actual or potential issues; the inability to obtain future product approvals, clearances, or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For example, in  February 2022, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan at which time it temporarily stopped manufacturing at the facility. In May 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the FDA. For information on the impact of Abbott's voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage, see the discussion in the 'Financial Review' section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.\n\n## Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\n\nAbbott's  industry  is  subject  to  various  international,  supranational,  federal,  and  state  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to  government  benefit  program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. V iolations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and V eterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices.

In the U.S., these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, laws and regulations relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state programs, such as the Medicaid Rebate Statute and the 340B statute, laws that regulate written and verbal communications about our products, individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing  practices,  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability Act  and  other  federal  and  state  laws  relating  to  the  privacy  and  security  of  health information, including the Executive Order on Preventing Access to Americans' Bulk Sensitive Personal Data, which may impact how and where clinical and other sensitive data is shared, accessed and analyzed, and United States G overnment-Related Data by Countries of Concern issued in February 2024. Actual or alleged violations of these laws or any related regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and U.S. Department of V eterans Affairs and U.S. Department of  Defense  health  programs,  actions  against  executives  overseeing  our  business  and  significant  remediation  measures,  negative  publicity  or  other consequences. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to changing and evolving interpretations, including as a result of legal challenges, which may increase following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overrule the Chevron doctrine, any of which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance, alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices, or impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. The resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material. Additionally, recently proposed legislation in the U.S., such as the BIOSECURE Act (which, among other things, could prohibit U.S. executive agencies from contracting with, or expending loans or granting funds to, companies that use biotechnology equipment or services for certain activities from certain foreign-owned entities), has the potential to adversely impact our ability to receive equipment or services from such entities, including certain of which we use in connection with our clinical trials and our clinical and commercial manufacturing, which could increase the cost or limit the supply of material available to us, delay the procurement or supply of such material, delay or impact clinical trials and regulatory submissions, delay the launch of commercial products and adversely affect our financial condition and business prospects.\n\nIn addition, government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, and we are continually assessing the methods by which we calculate and report pricing in accordance with these obligations. Our methodologies for calculations are inherently subject to assumptions and may be subject to review and challenge by various government agencies, which may disagree with our interpretation. If the government disagrees with our reported calculations, we may need to restate previously reported data and could be subject to additional financial and legal liability.\n\nThere also continues to be enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs and manufacturer donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by governments on reimbursement support offerings and other patient support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. Despite our training and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from unlawful acts committed by our employees or agents. If we, or our agents and vendors, are deemed to have failed to comply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any of these areas, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Any similar violations by our competitors could also negatively impact our industry's reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products.\n\nFor a description of our government investigations and related litigation, see Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and defend our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally, and to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.\n\nPatents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the U.S. and internationally covering our compounds, products and technology. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain patents and licenses to patent  rights,  enforce  our  patents  and  defend  against  infringement  of  our  patents  and  efforts  to  invalidate  them,  operate  without  infringing  on  the  intellectual property of others, and preserve trade secrets and internal know-how.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar national and international regulatory agencies. G overnment regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott's products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, postmarket changes to products, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott's laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require Abbott's laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.\n\nAbbott's international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott's investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.\n\nAbbott's laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement or payment to third-party payors, including government agencies such as Medicare and Medicaid, or governments. In the United States, these entities may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.\n\nAbbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott's business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In V itro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory  requirements  can  result  in  sanctions,  including  suspension,  revocation,  or  limitation  of  a  laboratory's  certification,  which  is  necessary  to  conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.\n\nAbbott's business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of healthcare products and their components that are  regularly  conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others.  These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.",

          "chunk_text": "## Health Care Fraud and Abuse / Anti-Bribery Regulation\n\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care 'fraud and abuse,' including anti-kickback laws and false claim laws. Antikickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to knowingly and willingly solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. False claims laws generally prohibit  anyone  from  knowingly  presenting,  or  causing  to  be  presented,  a  false  or  fraudulent  claim  for  payment  by  federal  and  certain  state  payers  (including Medicare and Medicaid), or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. In addition, FDA regulates written and verbal communications about our products. In addition to federal law, states also have consumer protection and false claims laws. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities, our sales, marketing, patient support, medical, clinical and public affairs activities  may  be  subject  to  scrutiny  under  these  laws.  For  ex ample,  recently  there  has  been  enhanced  scrutiny  by  government  enforcement authorities  of  company-sponsored  patient  assistance  programs,  including  co-pay  assistance  programs  and  manufacturer  donations  to  third-party  charities  that provide such assistance, reimbursement support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. Similarly, in Europe, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are subject to strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians' codes of professional conduct, as applicable, including the EU member states anti-corruption laws and the UK Bribery Act 2010.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom.\n\nWe have implemented trainings and programs geared toward compliance with these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws or anti-bribery laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). V iolations can also lead to the imposition of a Corporate Integrity Agreement or similar government oversight program, even if we disagree with the government's perspective that we have violated any rules or guidance.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  'We  are  impacted  by  evolving  laws,  regulations  and  legislative  or  regulatory  actions  applicable  to  the healthcare industry.'\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations that require compliance with federal, state and local regulations for the protection of the environment. Growing concern regarding climate change has resulted in an evolving legal and regulatory landscape, with new requirements enacted to prevent, mitigate or adapt to the  implications  of  climate  change.  These  regulations,  which  can  differ  across  jurisdictions,  subject  us  to  many  transition  risks,  including,  for  ex ample,  new  or expanded  carbon  pricing  or  tax es,  increased  compliance  costs,  restrictions  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  investment  in  new  technologies,  increased  carbon disclosure and transparency, investments in data gathering and reporting systems, upgrades of facilities to meet new building codes and the redesign of utility systems, which could increase the company's operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy. For example, over 80 countries committed to the United Nations COP26 Health Programme's initiatives on climate resilient and low carbon sustainable health systems. As such, there is an increasing expectation for the health sector to implement commitments to decarbonize and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Failure to sufficiently decarbonize or comply with climate-related requirements may threaten our ability to operate in certain geographies and negatively affect our business. Our suppliers and third-party manufacturers and corporate partners face similar transition risks that could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nWhile costs related to compliance with environmental regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate that these costs will have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, earnings and competitive position.\n\nFor more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors 'Climate change and natural disasters, as well as legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, can negatively affect our business and operations.'\n\n## Other Information\n\nWe are subject  to  the  information  requirements  of  the  Securities  Ex change Act  of  1934  ('Ex change Act').  Therefore,  we  file  periodic  reports,  prox y  and information statements and other information with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC').

      "answer": "Pfizer's regulatory risk is tied to a specific product\u2014Chantix\u2014where the company voluntarily recalled all U.S. lots in 2021 due to nitrosamine contamination exceeding FDA limits. This led to a market withdrawal and delayed international returns until regulatory submissions in 2024, impacting near-term revenue potential for this single drug. In contrast, Thermo Fisher faces systemic regulatory exposure across its entire pharma services segment, where failure to meet FDA and other regulatory standards could result in production halts, batch destruction, customer reimbursements, and reputational damage across a broad portfolio of drug and biologic manufacturing operations. While Pfizer's issue is isolated and resolvable through targeted regulatory submissions, Thermo Fisher's risk is ongoing and structural, with potential financial consequences including lost revenues, increased compliance costs, and customer relationship terminations across its complex service offerings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Pfizer recalled all U.S. lots of Chantix in 2021 due to nitrosamine levels exceeding FDA limits, with regulatory submissions planned for 2024 to return the product to international markets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Thermo Fisher's pharma services segment faces systemic regulatory risks where quality failures could lead to production halts, batch destruction, customer reimbursements, and termination of customer relationships.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Pfizer\u2019s regulatory issue is product-specific with defined financial implications tied to Chantix's delayed return, whereas Thermo Fisher\u2019s exposure is broader and structural, affecting its entire pharma services business with cascading financial impacts including compliance costs and potential loss of revenue streams."

      "answer": "The FDA's regulation of postmarketing commitments and biosimilar approvals affects PFE by requiring additional studies and delaying market exclusivity, which impacts competitive positioning. Specifically, biosimilar applications cannot be approved until 12 years after the reference product's licensing, limiting PFE's exclusivity window. Meanwhile, TMO faces potential adverse effects if increased FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests delays product commercialization and increases costs, which could reduce demand for TMO\u2019s drug discovery and development instruments, directly affecting their pharma services revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - PFE is subject to FDA regulation that requires postmarketing commitments and biosimilar applications cannot be approved until 12 years after the reference product's licensing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - TMO notes that increased FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests could delay commercialization and increase costs, adversely affecting demand for their pharmaceutical products and services.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - PFE's product development and competitive advantage are constrained by FDA-imposed exclusivity periods and postmarketing requirements, while TMO's ability to deliver timely and cost-effective pharma services is at risk from expanded FDA oversight, directly linking both companies' financial and operational outcomes to FDA regulatory actions."

As of December 31, 2023, Pfizer had $692 million in contingent consideration liabilities, with $512 million classified as noncurrent. Thermo Fisher Scientific accrues for self-insurance and other claims based on historical experience and probability assessments, recording receivables from insurers when recovery is probable. These differing approaches mean Pfizer faces potential large, unpredictable payouts from contingent obligations, while Thermo Fisher's risk is more systematically managed through accruals and third-party recoveries.",

      "question": "How do FDA approval delays specifically impact both Abbott's regulatory compliance costs and Pfizer's vaccine development timelines, given their respective exposure to regulatory scrutiny and product development cycles?",
      "answer": "FDA approval delays increase Abbott's regulatory compliance costs due to the need for additional resources to meet evolving regulatory requirements and maintain compliance during prolonged approval periods. For Pfizer, such delays hinder vaccine development timelines, particularly for new variant-specific vaccines and booster doses, which are critical to maintaining the commercial viability and supply projections for their COVID-19 vaccine program.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Abbott notes that delays in FDA approvals could result in 'delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs' and that 'possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include... substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Pfizer states that 'decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing... could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine or drug,' and specifically notes that delays could impact the 'ability to successfully develop... new variant-specific vaccines' and 'supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine... within the projected time periods.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to regulatory risk, but in different ways: Abbott faces increased costs from ongoing compliance and potential penalties during delays, while Pfizer faces disruption to its development and supply timelines, which directly affects its ability to meet global demand and projected revenue for its vaccine program."

The  process  of  obtaining  regulatory  approvals  to  market  a  drug,  medical  device,  diagnostic product,  or  nutritional  product  can  be  costly  and  time-consuming,  and  approvals  might  not  be  granted  for  future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure  to  obtain,  approvals  for  future  products,  or  new  indications  and  uses,  could  result  in  delayed  realization  of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\n\nIn  addition,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  Abbott  will  remain  in  compliance  with  applicable  FDA  and  other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include,  among  other  things,  regulations  regarding  manufacturing  practices,  product  labeling,  and  advertising  and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those  of  Abbott's  suppliers  are  subject  to  ongoing  regulation,  including  periodic  inspection  by  the  FDA  and  other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution.\n\nThese  actions  could  result  in,  among  other  things,  substantial  modifications  to Abbott's  business  practices  and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities  while  Abbott  or  Abbott's  suppliers  remedy  the  alleged  violation;  the  inability  to  obtain  future  pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\n## Laws  and  regulations  affecting  government  benefit  programs  could  impose  new  obligations  on  Abbott,  require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.\n\nAbbott's  industry  is  subject  to  various  international,  supranational,  federal,  and  state  laws  and  regulations pertaining  to  government  benefit  program  reimbursement,  price  reporting  and  regulation,  and  health  care  fraud  and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in  some  instances,  substantial  fines,  imprisonment,  and  exclusion  from  participation  in  government  health  care programs,  including  Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  Veterans Administration  health  programs  in  the  U.S.  These  laws  and regulations  are  broad  in  scope  and  they  are  subject  to  evolving  interpretations,  which  could  require Abbott  to  incur substantial  costs  associated  with  compliance  or  to  alter  one  or  more  of  its  sales  or  marketing  practices.  In  addition, violations  of  these  laws,  or  allegations  of  such  violations,  could  disrupt  Abbott's  business  and  result  in  a  material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.\n\nBoth in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott's products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them.\n\nFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act  of  2010  address  access  to  health  care  products  and  services. These  provisions  may  be  modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\n\nFor  additional  information  concerning  health  care  regulation,  see  the  discussion  in  'Regulation'  under  Item  1, 'Business.'\n\n## The  expiration  or  loss  of  intellectual  property  protection  and  licenses  may  affect  Abbott's  future  revenues  and operating income.\n\nMany of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could  be  reduced.  Any  material  litigation  regarding  Abbott's  patents  and  trademarks  is  described  in  the  section captioned 'Legal Proceedings.'",

Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. In particular, we believe the ultimate impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results will be affected by the speed and extent of the continued spread of the coronavirus globally, the emergence of additional virus variants, the duration of the pandemic, new information regarding the severity and incidence of COVID-19, the safety, efficacy and availability of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against COVID-19, the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines and vaccines. The pandemic may also affect our business, operations or financial condition and results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks.\n\n## MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS\n\nChanges in fair value of certain equity investments need to be recognized in net income that may result in increased volatility of our income. For additional information, see Note 4 and the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A.\n\nOur pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations are subject to volatility from changes in fair value of equity investments and other investment risk in the assets funding these plans.

Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of our costreduction and productivity initiatives, other corporate strategic initiatives and any acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, as well as potential disruption of ongoing business.\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nOur consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including IPR&amp;D and goodwill. For IPR&amp;D assets, the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. Our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory approvals and market acceptance. As such, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and/or be written off at some time in the future if the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned or is curtailed. For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n22",

      "answer": "The impact of FDA regulatory delays on Abbott and Pfizer affects their revenue projections differently based on the nature of their product pipelines. For Abbott, delays in FDA approvals for medical devices and diagnostics could result in delayed revenue realization or reduced revenues, as stated in their 10-K, which outlines the risk of costly and time-consuming regulatory processes that may prevent timely market entry for future products or new indications. For Pfizer, the 10-K highlights that delays in regulatory approval timelines for vaccines and pharmaceuticals\u2014especially in the context of public health emergencies like the ongoing evaluation of certain product candidates\u2014can significantly impact commercial potential, including decisions on labeling, marketing, and manufacturing. These delays could reduce expected revenue from new product launches or expanded indications. While neither company provides a specific dollar amount for projected revenue loss due to delays, Abbott notes that approval risks could result in 'delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs,' and Pfizer states that regulatory decisions 'could adversely affect our business.' Together, these disclosures indicate that FDA delays pose a material risk to both companies' ability to forecast and achieve expected revenue from new or expanded product offerings.",

        "Step 1: From Abbott's 2022 10-K, extract the risk that delays in FDA approvals for medical devices and diagnostics could result in delayed revenue realization or reduced revenues.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS:\n\n## PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT\n\nU.S. and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls or limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies. The adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions, more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue. We expect pricing pressures will continue globally.\n\nIn the U.S., pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform, and many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a result. We expect to see continued focus by the Federal government on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. Some states have implemented, and others are considering, patient access constraints or cost cutting under the Medicaid program, and some are considering measures that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. State legislatures also have continued to focus on addressing drug costs, generally by increasing price transparency or limiting drug price increases. Measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect our business. For additional information on U.S. pricing and reimbursement, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K.\n\nWe encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate. In certain markets, such as in EU member states, the U.K., Japan, China, Canada and South Korea, governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices, access criteria, or impose other means of cost control, particularly as a result of recent global financing pressures. For example, the QCE and VBP tender process in China has resulted in dramatic price cuts for off-patent medicines. For additional information regarding these government initiatives, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures in China and elsewhere in the future. In addition, in many countries, with respect to our vaccines, we participate in a tender process for selection in national immunization programs. Failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business. We also anticipate pricing pressures will be amplified by COVID-19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.\n\n## U.S. HEALTHCARE REGULATION\n\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Any significant efforts at the U.S. federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us. For additional information on U.S. healthcare regulation, see the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K.\n\nOther U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, among others, general budget control actions, changes in patent laws, the importation of prescription drugs to the U.S. at prices that are regulated by foreign governments, revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government programs that could reference international prices or require new discounts, limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders, or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines.\n\nA reduction of U.S. federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products. Any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS\n\nThe discovery and development of drugs, vaccines and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. The outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk due to the following factors, among others:\n\n- The process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years.\n- Product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process, including as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, or unfavorable new pre-clinical or clinical data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical or clinical data, including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication.\n- We may need to amend our clinical trial protocols or conduct additional clinical trials under certain circumstances, for example, to further assess appropriate dosage or collect additional safety data.\n- We may not be able to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates.\n- We may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and the EMA, or be able to obtain approval for new products and indications from regulators.\n\nRegulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors, including regulatory determinations as to the product's safety and efficacy. In the context of public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency or conditional basis. Additionally, clinical trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities. As a result of regulatory interpretations and assessments or other developments that occur during the review process, and even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing, a product's commercial potential could be adversely affected by potential emerging concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters, including decisions relating to emerging developments regarding potential product impurities.\n\nWe may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as the ACIP or any FDA Advisory Committee that may be convened to review our applications such as EUAs, NDAs or BLAs, which may impact the potential marketing and use of our products. Further, claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can negatively impact product sales, and potentially lead to product recalls or withdrawals, including regulator-directed risk evaluations and\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n17",

      "answer": "Abbott faces risks related to the expiration or loss of intellectual property protection, which could reduce future revenues and operating income. If Abbott's patents are successfully challenged or invalidated, its businesses could suffer due to reduced protection against competitors. In contrast, Pfizer explicitly outlines the financial consequences of patent-related disputes in the context of pharmaceutical product launches, noting that if a product is found to infringe valid third-party patents, Pfizer could be awarded significant damages or required to pay royalties, with potential damages enhanced up to three-fold if willful infringement is found. Therefore, while Abbott's risk centers on diminished market exclusivity and resulting revenue erosion, Pfizer's exposure includes both revenue constraints and direct financial liabilities such as damages or ongoing royalty payments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.\n\nAbbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and  state  authorities.  The  process  of  obtaining  regulatory  approvals  to  market  a  drug,  medical  device,  diagnostic product,  or  nutritional  product  can  be  costly  and  time-consuming,  and  approvals  might  not  be  granted  for  future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure  to  obtain,  approvals  for  future  products,  or  new  indications  and  uses,  could  result  in  delayed  realization  of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\n\nIn  addition,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  Abbott  will  remain  in  compliance  with  applicable  FDA  and  other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include,  among  other  things,  regulations  regarding  manufacturing  practices,  product  labeling,  and  advertising  and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those  of  Abbott's  suppliers  are  subject  to  ongoing  regulation,  including  periodic  inspection  by  the  FDA  and  other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution.\n\nThese  actions  could  result  in,  among  other  things,  substantial  modifications  to Abbott's  business  practices  and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities  while  Abbott  or  Abbott's  suppliers  remedy  the  alleged  violation;  the  inability  to  obtain  future  pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\n## Laws  and  regulations  affecting  government  benefit  programs  could  impose  new  obligations  on  Abbott,  require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.\n\nAbbott's  industry  is  subject  to  various  international,  supranational,  federal,  and  state  laws  and  regulations pertaining  to  government  benefit  program  reimbursement,  price  reporting  and  regulation,  and  health  care  fraud  and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in  some  instances,  substantial  fines,  imprisonment,  and  exclusion  from  participation  in  government  health  care programs,  including  Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  Veterans Administration  health  programs  in  the  U.S.  These  laws  and regulations  are  broad  in  scope  and  they  are  subject  to  evolving  interpretations,  which  could  require Abbott  to  incur substantial  costs  associated  with  compliance  or  to  alter  one  or  more  of  its  sales  or  marketing  practices.  In  addition, violations  of  these  laws,  or  allegations  of  such  violations,  could  disrupt  Abbott's  business  and  result  in  a  material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.\n\nBoth in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott's products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them.\n\nFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act  of  2010  address  access  to  health  care  products  and  services. These  provisions  may  be  modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\n\nFor  additional  information  concerning  health  care  regulation,  see  the  discussion  in  'Regulation'  under  Item  1, 'Business.'\n\n## The  expiration  or  loss  of  intellectual  property  protection  and  licenses  may  affect  Abbott's  future  revenues  and operating income.\n\nMany of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could  be  reduced.  Any  material  litigation  regarding  Abbott's  patents  and  trademarks  is  described  in  the  section captioned 'Legal Proceedings.'",

          "chunk_text": "For example, our R&amp;D in a therapeutic area may not be first and another company or entity may have obtained relevant patents before us. We are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our attempts to market pharmaceutical products. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related products, we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 'at-risk' launch). If one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\n\n## INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY\n\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We extensively rely upon sophisticated information technology systems (including cloud services) to operate our business. We produce, collect, process, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such confidential information. We have outsourced significant elements of our operations, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we manage relationships with many third-party providers who may or could have access to our confidential information. We rely on technology developed, supplied and/or maintained by third-parties that may make us vulnerable to 'supply chain' style cyber-attacks. Further, technology and security vulnerabilities of acquisitions, business partners or thirdparty providers may not be identified during due diligence or soon enough to mitigate exploitation. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party providers (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or contingent workers, providers, or malicious attackers. As a global pharmaceutical company, our systems and assets are the target of frequent cyber-attacks. Such cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, 'hacktivists,' nation states and others. Due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, our efforts may not prevent service interruptions, extortion, theft of confidential or proprietary information, compromise of data integrity or unauthorized information disclosure. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT:\n\n## BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES\n\nWe expect to enhance our in-line products and product pipeline through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. The success of these activities is dependent on the availability and accurate cost/benefit evaluation of appropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability to satisfy closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes or at all, and successfully integrate acquisitions. Pursuing these opportunities may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings. Where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities, the value of those securities will fluctuate, and may depreciate. We may not control a company in which we invest, and, as a result, we will have limited ability to determine its management, operational decisions and policies. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. The success of any of our acquisitions will depend, when applicable, on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating these businesses with us. We, for example, may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with certain of these acquisitions, or such cost savings within the expected time frame. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisitions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue growth for the acquired business. Expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates, including those acquired in these acquisitions.\n\n## SPIN-OFF AND COMBINATION OF UPJOHN WITH MYLAN\n\nWe may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off and combination (the Transactions) of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, which resulted in the creation of Viatris in November 2020, due to many factors, including, among others, strategic adjustments required to reflect the nature of our business following the Transactions, increased risks resulting from us becoming a company that is a more focused, innovative science-based biopharmaceutical products business and the possibility that we may not achieve our strategic objectives. In addition, we have agreed to provide certain transition services to Viatris, generally for an initial period of 24 months following the completion of the Transactions (with certain possibilities for extension). These obligations under the transition services agreements may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business.\n\n## CONSUMER HEALTHCARE JV WITH GSK\n\nIn 2019, we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a JV that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. Although we have certain consent, board representation and other governance rights, we are a minority owner of the JV and do not control the JV, its management or its policies. As a result, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction depend upon GSK's operation and management of the JV. In addition, the JV is subject to risks that are different than the risks associated with our business. Many of these risks are outside GSK's or the JV's control and could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the JV.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

This risk is heightened by the competitive landscape where new entrants or advancements can render current devices less desirable or obsolete. Similarly, Pfizer notes that competitive product launches may result in unanticipated product obsolescence, particularly for products like Ibrance and Xeljanz, which face challenges from generic manufacturers and biosimilars. Both companies are exposed to revenue risk: Abbott due to potential loss of market share in high-margin device categories, and Pfizer due to its reliance on major products like Comirnaty, which accounted for 45% of total revenue in 2021.

Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail  distribution,  and  availability  of  product  forms. A  significant  aspect  of  competition  is  the  search  for  ingredient innovations.  The  introduction  of  new  products  by  competitors,  changes  in  medical  practices  and  procedures,  and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure.\n\n## Medical Devices\n\nThese  products  include  a  broad  line  of  rhythm  management,  electrophysiology,  heart  failure,  vascular  and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally  marketed  and  sold  directly  to  wholesalers,  hospitals,  ambulatory  surgery  centers,  physicians'  offices,  and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses.

          "chunk_text": "not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Additionally, our business is subject to general risks applicable to any company, such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, extreme weather and natural disasters. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, our business operations, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, prospects, reputation or credit ratings could be adversely affected now and in the future, potentially in a material way. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in the Forward-Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results section in this Form 10-K.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS:\n\n## MANAGED CARE TRENDS\n\nPrivate payers, such as health plans, and other managed care entities, such as PBMs, continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs. The negotiating power of MCOs and other private third-party payers has increased due to consolidation, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. These initiatives have increased consumers' interest and input in medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lower-cost generic alternatives. We may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products, or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing.\n\nThe growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions, which typically have smaller patient populations, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, also has generated increased payer interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector.\n\nThird-party payers also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts. Such payers are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. private third-party payer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, we may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers as they continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.\n\nAlso, business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny, and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, as well as evolving judicial interpretations. Our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government and industry guidance.\n\n## COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS\n\nCompetitive product launches may erode future sales of our products, including our existing products and those currently under development, or result in unanticipated product obsolescence. Such launches continue to occur, and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those treated by our inline products and product candidates.\n\nIn addition, competition from manufacturers of generic drugs, including from generic versions of competitors' branded products that lose their market exclusivity, is a major challenge for our branded products. Certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business-Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. In China, we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers, which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products.\n\nIn addition, our patented products may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires, including upon the 'at-risk' launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products. Generic manufacturers have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our patents or claim that our patents are not valid; these include candidates that would compete with, among other products, Ibrance and Xeljanz. Our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights.\n\nWe may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars.\n\nWe also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others, including other biosimilar products. The entry to the market of competing biosimilars is expected to increase pricing pressures on our biosimilar products. Uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors, such as anti-competitive practices, access challenges where our product may not receive appropriate coverage/reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product, physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the innovative product, or misaligned financial incentives.\n\nFor additional information on competition our products face, see the Item 1. Business -Competition section in this Form 10-K.\n\n## CONCENTRATION\n\nWe recorded direct product and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products that collectively accounted for 75% of our total revenues in 2021. In particular, Comirnaty/BNT162b2 accounted for 45% of our total revenues in 2021. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 17 . If these products or any of our other major products were to experience loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription or vaccination growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects or safety concerns, regulatory proceedings, negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing and access pressures or supply shortages or if a new, more effective product should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant. In particular, certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and patents covering a number of our best-selling products are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For additional information on our patents, see the Item 1. Business -Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n14",

          "chunk_text": "## Military conflicts (s uch as  the conflicts  between Rus s ia and Ukraine and in the Middle East) can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nMilitary conflicts (such as the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East) can adv ersely affect our business and financial statements. For example, consequences of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine hav e included sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse impacts on energy supplies and prices, and such conflict or other conflicts may cause similar adv erse effects in the future. In addition to suspending sales prohibited by sanctions, the Company has suspended the shipment of products to Russia with the exception of products for the purposes of diagnosing and treating patients and producing v accines and therapeutics. Military conflicts also heighten other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of which can adv ersely affect our business and financial statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adv erse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including increased inflation, constraints on the av ailability of commodities, supply chain disruption and decreased business spending; disruptions to our or our business partners' global technology infrastructure, including through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion; adv erse changes in international trade policies and relations; claims, litigation and regulatory enforcement; potential retaliatory actions by gov ernments against companies, such as nationalization of foreign businesses; adv erse impacts on our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; terrorist activ ities; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; reputational risk; and constraints, v olatility, or disruption in the capital markets.\n\nIn 2024, Russia, Ukraine and Israel sales combined accounted for less than 1% of the Company's sales.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational Risks\n\n## Significant developments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.\n\nSignificant dev elopments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition, including laws and policies in areas such as trade, manufacturing, gov ernment purchasing, healthcare, intellectual property and inv estment/dev elopment, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, certain gov ernments hav e implemented policies to induce 're-shoring' of supply chains, reduce reliance on imported supplies and promote national production. The Chinese gov ernment has issued a series of policies in the past several years to promote the dev elopment and use of local medical dev ices. In addition, in recent years the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain imported goods and trade tensions between China and other countries (including the U.S.) hav e escalated, with countries imposing significant additional tariffs on a wide range of imported goods. Following the recent change of administration in the U.S., new tariffs hav e been implemented and hav e prompted retaliatory tariffs by certain countries, further tariffs my follow and the risks noted abov e hav e increased. The full impact of these tariffs on the Company and our business partners remains uncertain.\n\n## Our business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our Code of Conduct, protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that v iolate laws, including the laws gov erning payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behav ior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data priv acy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to gov ernment officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that hav e experienced gov ernmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civ il or criminal inv estigations and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civ il and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and inv estigatory fees. In addition, the gov ernment may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we inv est or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, and violations of such code of conduct could adv ersely affect our business and financial statements.\n\n## Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nIn addition to the env ironmental, health, safety, healthcare, medical dev ice, anticorruption, data priv acy, artificial intelligence, sustainability and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensiv e regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. gov ernmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional lev els, including for example the following:",

          "chunk_text": "In addition, the testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. We have limited insurance for product liabilities that may arise and claims may ex ceed our coverage.\n\nFor a description of our litigation, investigation and other dispute-related matters, see Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The outcome of such legal proceedings or any other legal proceedings that may be brought against us, the investigations or any other investigations that may be initiated and any other dispute-related matters, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\n## Our business has been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases.\n\nActual  or  threatened  outbreaks  of  epidemic,  pandemic  or  contagious  diseases,  or  other  public  health  emergencies,  may  significantly  disrupt  our  global operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we have seen with the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks can result in global supply chain and logistics disruptions and distribution constraints. The impact of an outbreak or other public health crisis on our results of operations and financial  condition  would  depend  on  numerous  evolving  factors,  but  could  involve  higher  operating  ex penses,  lower  demand  for  our  products  as  a  result  of governmental,  business  and  individuals'  actions  taken  in  response  to  such  an  event  (including  quarantines,  travel  restrictions  and  interruptions  to  healthcare services, which can impact enrollment in or operation of our clinical trials or limit patients' ability or willingness to access and seek care), challenges associated with the safety of our employees and safe occupancy of our job sites, and financial market volatility and significant macroeconomic uncertainty in global markets. An outbreak or public health emergency also could amplify many of the other risks described throughout the 'Risk Factors' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## We face risks associated with our global operations.\n\nOur global operations are accompanied by certain financial, political, economic and other risks, including those listed below:\n\n- Foreign Currency Exchange: Because a significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies, and therefore, we benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. Our hedging program does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations. We may be adversely impacted if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation. For example, see 'Foreign Currency Exchange Impact' in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro, and the impacts from foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n- Interest Rates and Inflation: We have interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including our senior unsecured notes and credit facilities. Fluctuations in interest rates could ex pose us to increased financial risk. In addition, high inflation, such as what we have seen in recent years, has adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our business and financial results.\n- Anti-Bribery: We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws that govern our international operations with respect to payments to government officials. Our international operations are heavily regulated and require significant interaction with foreign officials. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state-controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom. It is possible that certain of our practices may be challenged under these laws. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees and agents. Enforcement activities under anti-bribery laws could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties and exclusion from healthcare programs.\n\nOther risks inherent in conducting a global business include:\n\n- Restrictive  government  actions  against  our  intellectual  property  and  other  assets  such  as  nationalization,  ex propriation,  the  imposition  of  compulsory licenses or similar actions, including waiver of intellectual property protections.",

      "answer": "DHR adjusted the exercise price and number of shares underlying stock-based compensation awards during the Separation to preserve intrinsic value, which did not significantly impact stock compensation expense. Meanwhile, GILD reports $1.1 billion in unrecognized compensation cost for unvested RSUs, expected to be recognized over 2.2 years. Since PSUs at GILD include dividend equivalent rights that are paid upon vesting, the financial impact of those rights is deferred until vesting occurs, aligning with the compensation cost recognition timeline. Therefore, while both companies account for dividend equivalent rights in PSUs, DHR\u2019s adjustments during the Separation insulated its expense from disruption, contrasting with GILD\u2019s ongoing recognition of a large deferred cost tied to unvested RSUs, which indirectly affects how dividend equivalent rights influence financial planning and compensation strategy.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - DHR's adjustments during the Separation preserved award value without affecting expense, while GILD's $1.1 billion in deferred RSU costs affects financial planning, especially as dividend equivalent rights are only paid upon vesting, aligning with this cost recognition timeline."

The PSU dividend equiv alent rights are subject to the same v esting and payment restrictions as the related shares, and the shares underlying the PSUs are not considered issued and outstanding.\n\nThe equity compensation awards granted by the Company generally v est only if the employee is employed by the Company (or in the case of directors, the director continues to serv e on the Company Board) on the v esting date or in other limited circumstances, including following a qualifying retirement. To cover the exercise of options and v esting of RSUs and PSUs, the Company generally issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool, although it may instead issue treasury shares in certain circumstances.\n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee serv ices receiv ed in exchange for all equity awards granted based on the fair v alue of the award as of the grant date. The Company recognizes the compensation expense ov er the requisite serv ice period (which is generally the v esting period but may be shorter than the v esting period if the employee becomes retirement eligible before the end of the v esting period). The fair v alue for RSU awards was calculated using the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the fact that RSUs do not accrue div idends. The fair v alue of the PSU awards was calculated using a Monte Carlo pricing model. The fair v alue of the options granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model ('Black-Scholes').\n\nIn connection with the Separation and in accordance with the employee matters agreement Danaher and Veralto hav e entered into, stock-based compensation awards have been converted into awards of the company that employs the employee post-separation. The Company has made certain adjustments to the exercise price and the number of shares underlying the stock-based compensation awards held by its employees, with the intention of preserv ing the intrinsic v alue of the awards immediately prior to the Separation. The adjustment to the Company's stock-based compensation awards as a result of the Separation did not hav e a significant impact to the Company's stock compensation expense. Veralto has responsibility for the awards that were conv erted into Veralto awards.\n\nThe following summarizes the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to v alue options granted during the years ended December 31:\n\n",

      "answer": "DHR identifies that uncertainties in the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in its products could lead to unintended consequences, such as flawed algorithms or biased datasets, which may harm public confidence and result in reputational damage. Additionally, failure to successfully deploy AI could reduce competitiveness and require additional investment, directly affecting financial performance and brand reputation. GILD, on the other hand, highlights that cybersecurity incidents or ERP implementation failures could lead to data breaches, service interruptions, and reputational harm. These events could result in legal liability, regulatory action, and financial losses due to operational inefficiencies and loss of market opportunities. Both companies explicitly link their respective risks to potential brand harm, with DHR citing reputational effects from AI-related issues and GILD citing reputational and financial impacts from cybersecurity breaches and system disruptions.",

Demand for our products and serv ices is also sensitiv e to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, marketing or promotional programs, new product introductions, the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inv entory lev els due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. Any of these factors could adv ersely affect our business and financial statements in any giv en period.\n\n## Uncertainties with respect to the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence in our business and products may result in harm to our business and reputation.\n\nWe are in the early stages of incorporating artificial intelligence ('AI') into our business activ ities and our product and serv ice offerings. As with many innov ations, AI presents risks and challenges that could adv ersely impact our business. The dev elopment, adoption, and use of AI technologies are still in their early stages and ineffectiv e or inadequate AI dev elopment or deployment practices could result in unintended consequences. For example, AI algorithms may be flawed or may be based on datasets that are biased or insufficient. In addition, any disruption or failure in the AI functionality we incorporate into our business activ ities, products or serv ices could adv ersely impact our business or result in delays or errors in our offerings. Conversely, any failure to successfully dev elop and deploy AI in our business activ ities, products and serv ices could adv ersely affect our competitiv eness (particularly if our competitors successfully deploy AI in their businesses, products and serv ices), and the dev elopment and deployment of AI will require additional inv estment and increase our costs. There also may be real or perceiv ed social harm, unfairness, or other outcomes that undermine public confidence in the use and deployment of AI. Any of the foregoing may result in decreased demand for our products or harm to our business, financial statements or reputation.\n\nThe legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly ev olv ing and uncertain, including in the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity and priv acy and data protection. Compliance with new or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant costs and may limit our ability to dev elop, deploy or use AI technologies. Failure to appropriately respond to this ev olv ing landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational harm.\n\n## Global health crises, pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks can adversely impact certain elements of our business and financial statements.\n\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activ ities, including as a result of prev entiv e and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and gov ernments undertook to mitigate the spread. Any resurgence of COVID-19 (or the outbreak of any epidemic or pandemic) or the reinstatement of similar prev entiv e measures in the future could negativ ely impact the economies and financial markets of the world and our business and financial statements. To the extent we dev elop and sell products to help epidemics or pandemics in the future, as such epidemics/pandemics ev olv e we may experience v olatility and declines in demand that are unanticipated in timing or magnitude, which could adv ersely affect our business and financial statements.\n\n## Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with business partners and other third-parties for development, supply and/or marketing of certain products, potential products and technologies, and such business partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.\n\nFor certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to dev elop and maintain business relationships with other companies. Relying on these relationships is risky because, among other things, our business partners may (1) not dev ote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) fail to obtain regulatory approv als necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) be acquired by other companies and terminate our partnership or become insolv ent; (4) compete with us; (5) disagree with us on key details of the business relationship; (6) hav e insufficient capital resources; (7) fail to comply with applicable laws, regulatory requirements and/or applicable contractual obligations; and (8) terminate or decline to renew existing relationships on acceptable terms, which may require us to dev ote additional resources to product dev elopment and commercialization and/or cancel programs.

Implementation or upgrade of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to our business operations. If we do not successfully implement ERP and other information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, we may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and we may experience operational difficulties and challenges in effectively managing our business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFor example, we are currently in the process of implementing new ERP and other information systems to help us manage our operations and financial reporting. Costs and risks inherent in this transition may include disruptions to business continuity, administrative and technical problems, interruptions or delays in sales, manufacturing or R&amp;D processes, expenditure overruns, delays in paying our suppliers and employees, and data migration issues. If we do not properly address or mitigate these issues, this could result in increased costs and diversion of resources, negatively impacting our operating results and ability to effectively manage our business. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned, or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.\n\n## Information system service interruptions or breaches, including significant cybersecurity incidents, could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. For example, our Kite Konnect platform is critical to maintain chain of identity and chain of custody for our cell therapies.  The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction,  including  those  caused  by  failures  during  system  upgrades  or  implementations,  user  error,  network  or  hardware  failure,  malicious  intrusion  and ransomware attack. Likewise, data privacy or cybersecurity incidents or breaches by employees or others, including the unauthorized use of artificial intelligence tools,  can  result  in  the  ex posure  of  sensitive  data,  including  our  intellectual  property  or  trade  secrets  or  the  personal  information  of  our  employees,  patients, customers or other business partners to unauthorized persons or to the public. If our information systems or third-party information systems on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, including during upgrades or new implementations, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments.\n\nCybersecurity attacks and incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Malicious actors seek to steal money, gain unauthorized access to, destroy or manipulate data, and disrupt operations, and some of their attacks may not be recognized or discovered until after a significant period of time well after initial entry into the environment, such as novel or zero-day attacks that are launched before patches are available and defenses can be readied. Malicious actors  are  also  increasingly  developing  methods  to  avoid  prevention,  detection  and  alerting  capabilities,  including  employing  counter-forensic  tactics  making response activities  more  difficult.  Such  attacks  and  incidents  include,  for  ex ample,  the  deployment  of  harmful  malware,  ex ploitation  of  vulnerabilities,  computer viruses, key loggers, ransomware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and operations and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Recent developments in the threat landscape include the use of increasingly sophisticated and evolving artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. Our business and technology partners face similar risks, and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture.\n\nLike many companies, we have experienced and expect to continue to be the target of cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches and temporary service interruptions. When cybersecurity incidents occur, our policy is to respond and address them in accordance with applicable governmental regulations and other legal requirements, including our cybersecurity protocols. There can be no assurance that our efforts in response to cybersecurity incidents, as well as our investments to protect our information technology infrastructure and data, will shield us from significant losses, brand and reputational harm and potential liability or prevent any future interruption or breach of our systems. Such cybersecurity incidents can cause the loss of critical or sensitive information, including personal information, and could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws. Financial, legal, business, or reputational losses may result from a cybersecurity incident or breach of our information technology systems.",

      "answer": "Clinical trial delays pose significant regulatory risks for both DHR and GILD, though the nature and impact of these delays differ based on their respective product types and regulatory pathways. For DHR, delays or unexpected clinical data can hinder the 510(k) clearance process for product modifications. Specifically, if the FDA disagrees with DHR's determination that a product modification does not require a new 510(k) clearance, the company may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified product until clearance is obtained. This creates uncertainty in maintaining continuous market access for updated medical devices. For GILD, clinical trial delays or unfavorable data have more immediate commercial consequences due to its reliance on accelerated approvals in oncology. For example, in October 2024, GILD announced a voluntary withdrawal of the U.S. accelerated approval for Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy; SG) for urothelial cancer due to unsuccessful confirmatory studies, which is a direct consequence of clinical trial outcomes affecting regulatory maintenance. Additionally, GILD discontinued the Phase 3 ARC-10 study for domvanalimab plus zimberelimab in NSCLC due to strategic prioritization, highlighting how trial timelines and data can influence internal development decisions. These examples show that while DHR faces regulatory process risks tied to device modifications, GILD's exposure centers on maintaining accelerated approvals and advancing oncology pipelines, both of which are critically dependent on timely and favorable clinical trial outcomes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from DHR's 10-K - DHR may be required to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications if the FDA disagrees with their determination on product modifications, which could lead to recalls or halted marketing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from GILD's 10-K - GILD withdrew the accelerated approval for Trodelvy in October 2024 due to unsuccessful confirmatory studies and discontinued the ARC-10 Phase 3 study due to strategic prioritization.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to clinical trial delays, but DHR's exposure centers on regulatory clearance for device modifications, while GILD's is tied to maintaining accelerated approvals and advancing oncology pipelines. The specific impacts include DHR's potential need for new clearances and GILD's loss of a key oncology indication."

Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator's or market perception of these clinical data, can adv ersely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements. In addition, our products and serv ices may support or be used in connection with customer products that are subject to clinical trials, and adv erse results in any such clinical trials may adversely affect future demand for our products and serv ices.\n\n## Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.\n\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about approv ed or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receiv e only permit us to market our products for the intended uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance.

We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believ e do not require a new clearance or approv al. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civ il and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.\n\n## Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nOur operations, products and serv ices are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. env ironmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the env ironment, inv estigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at v arious sites, chemical constituents in products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for products sold.

Based on trial results, it is possible that FDA and other regulatory authorities do not approve our product candidates, or that any market approvals include significant limitations on the products' use. Additionally, products and indications approved under accelerated approval pathways may be subject to withdrawal where confirmatory studies are unsuccessful. In October 2024, we announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval for Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy; SG ) for treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and either programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products can raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could adversely impact our business. Further, we have in the past and we may in the future make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates, including but not limited to situations where we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. For example, in January 2024, we announced with our partner Arcus Biosciences, Inc. ('Arcus') the discontinuation of further enrollment in the Phase 3 ARC-10 study evaluating  domvanalimab  plus  zimberelimab  in  first-line  locally  advanced  or  metastatic,  PD-L1-high  NSCLC  based  on  strategic  prioritization  to  advance  and potentially accelerate other Phase 3 studies in our collaboration with Arcus. Therefore, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized, and we may be unable to recoup the significant R&amp;D, clinical trial, acquisition-related and other ex penses incurred. We expect to spend significant time and resources on our clinical trial activities without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful.\n\nThere are also risks associated with the use of third parties in our clinical trial activities. We ex tensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on third-party contract research organizations ('CROs') to perform most of our clinical studies, including  document  preparation,  site  identification,  screening  and  preparation,  pre-study  visits,  training,  program  management,  patient  enrollment,  ongoing monitoring, site management and bioanalysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are not within our direct control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationships with our CROs, including as a result of legislative or regulatory actions, our clinical trials and regulatory submissions may be delayed and our costs may increase. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by our CROs. If any of their processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals may be adversely affected.\n\n## We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, or we may face manufacturing difficulties, delays or interruptions, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.\n\nWe need access to certain materials and supplies to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture and sell our products. If we are unable to purchase enough of these materials and supplies or find suitable alternatives in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture and sell our products could be limited. For example, in the U.S., there have been ongoing or recent shortages of certain cancer drugs that are the backbone of standard-of-care treatments, such as carboplatin and cisplatin, which are also used in R&amp;D and clinical trials. While we have observed minimal impacts to our oncology clinical trials to date, if these shortages continue or increase in magnitude, our ongoing and future oncology clinical trials may be delayed, halted or adversely impacted.\n\nSuppliers of key components and materials must be named in the new drug application or marketing authorization application filed with the regulatory authority for  any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Our products, which are manufactured at our own facilities or by third-party contract manufacturing organizations ('CMOs') and corporate partners, are the result of complex, highly regulated manufacturing processes. We depend on CMOs and corporate partners to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are out of our control. Some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are manufactured by only one supplier or at only one facility, which we may not be able to replace in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We and our CMOs and corporate partners are subject to current G ood Manufacturing Practices ('cGMP'), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, recordkeeping and quality standards as defined by  FDA and  European  Medicines Agency ('EMA'), as well as comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.  Manufacturing operations are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. Even after a supplier is qualified by the regulatory authority, the supplier must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain full compliance with cGMP. If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remedy any deficiencies cited by FDA or other regulatory agencies in their inspections. Further, there is risk that regulatory agencies in other countries where marketing applications are pending will undertake similar additional reviews or apply a heightened standard of review, which could delay the regulatory approvals for products in those countries.",

As of December 31, 2024, the Company held $3 million of publicly-traded equity securities, excluding equity-method inv estments. Additionally, the Company holds non-marketable equity inv estments in priv ately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks. These non-marketable equity inv estments are accounted for under the Fair Value Alternativ e method with changes in fair v alue recorded in earnings. Volatility in the equity markets or other fair v alue considerations could affect the v alue of these inv estments and require losses or gains to be recognized in earnings. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's equity inv estments.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the ev ent of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary inv estments, receiv ables from customers and deriv ativ es. The Company places cash and temporary investments with v arious high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equiv alents. The Company's emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.\n\nIn addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receiv ables from customers are limited due to the div ersity of the Company's customers. The Company's businesses perform credit ev aluations of their customers' financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate.\n\nThe Company enters into deriv ativ e transactions infrequently and typically with high-quality financial institutions, so that exposure at any one institution is limited.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nManagement assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, inv esting and financing activ ities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activ ities and believ es that its operating cash flow, cash on hand and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue inv esting in existing businesses (including capital expenditures), consummating strategic acquisitions and inv estments, paying interest and serv icing debt, paying div idends and funding restructuring activ ities, as well as to repurchase common stock when deemed appropriate and manage its capital structure on a short-term and long-term basis.\n\nThe Company has relied primarily on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity prov ided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand, while also accessing the capital markets from time to time including to secure financing for more significant acquisitions. Subject to any limitations that may result from market disruptions, the Company anticipates following the same approach in the future.",

          "chunk_text": "We face numerous risks and uncertainties  with  our  clinical  trials  that  could  result  in  delays  or  prevent  completion  of  the development and approval  of  our  product  candidates. These  risks  and  uncertainties  include  challenges  in  clinical  trial  protocol design, our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, and the possibility of unfavorable or inadequate trial results to support further development of our product candidates, including failure to meet a trial's primary endpoint, safety issues arising from our clinical trials, and the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials. For example, we recently announced clinical holds placed by FDA on clinical trials evaluating (1) injectable lenacapavir, (2) lenacapavir in combination with islatravir and (3) magrolimab, including in combination with azacitidine.\n\nAs a result, we may be unable to successfully complete our clinical trials on our anticipated timelines, or at all. Based on trial results,  it  is  possible  that  FDA  and  other  regulatory  authorities  may  not  approve  our  product  candidates,  or  that  any  market approvals may include significant limitations on the products' use. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could  raise  new  safety  issues  for  our  existing  products,  which  could  adversely  impact  our  business.  Further,  we  may  make  a strategic  decision  to  discontinue  development  of  our  product  candidates  if,  for  example,  we  believe  commercialization  will  be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. Therefore, our product candidates may  never  be successfully commercialized, and we may be unable to recoup the significant R&amp;D and clinical trial expenses incurred. In 2022, we anticipate the  continued  expansion  of  our  clinical  pipeline,  which  includes  multiple  planned  Phase  3  study  initiations  in  oncology  and virology. We expect to expend significant time and resources on our clinical trial  activities  without  any  assurance  that  we  will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful.\n\nThere are also risks associated with the use of third parties in our clinical trial activities. We extensively outsource our clinical trial  activities  and  usually  perform  only  a  small  portion  of  the  start-up  activities  in-house.  We  rely  on  independent  third-party contract  research  organizations  ('CROs')  to  perform  most  of  our  clinical  studies,  including  document  preparation,  site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management, patient enrollment, ongoing monitoring, site management and bioanalytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs' processes,  methodologies  or  results  were  determined  to  be  invalid  or  inadequate,  our  own  clinical  data  and  results  and related regulatory approvals may be adversely affected.\n\n## We may face manufacturing difficulties, delays or interruptions, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners.\n\nOur products, which are manufactured at our own facilities or by third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, are the result of complex, highly regulated manufacturing processes. We depend on third-party manufacturers and corporate partners to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are out of our control. We and our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are subject to Good Manufacturing Practices ('GMP'), which  are  extensive  regulations  governing  manufacturing  processes,  stability  testing,  record  keeping  and  quality  standards  as defined  by  FDA  and  the  European  Medicines  Agency  ('EMA'),  as  well  as  comparable  regulations  in  other  jurisdictions. Manufacturing operations are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies.\n\nAny  adverse  developments  affecting  or  resulting  from  our  manufacturing  operations  or  the  operations  of  our  third-party manufacturers  and  corporate  partners  may  result  in  shipment  delays,  inventory  shortages,  lot  failures,  product  withdrawals  or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products. We may also need to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and quality standards, undertake costly remediation efforts or  seek  more  costly  manufacturing  alternatives.  Such  developments  could  increase  our  manufacturing  costs,  cause  us  to  lose revenues or market share and damage our reputation. In addition, manufacturing issues may cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. For example, if we are unable to remedy any deficiencies cited by FDA or other regulatory agencies in their inspections, our existing products and the timing of regulatory approval of product candidates in development could  be  adversely  affected.  Further,  there  is  risk  that  regulatory  agencies  in  other  countries  where  marketing  applications  are pending  will  undertake  similar  additional  reviews  or  apply  a  heightened  standard  of  review,  which  could  delay  the  regulatory approvals for products in those countries. Our business may be adversely affected if approval of any of our product candidates were delayed or if production of our products were interrupted.\n\n## We may not be able to  obtain  materials  or  supplies  necessary  to  conduct  clinical  trials  or  to  manufacture  and  sell  our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.\n\nWe need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture and sell our products. If we are  unable  to  purchase  sufficient  quantities  of  these  materials  or  find  suitable  alternative  materials  in  a  timely  manner,  our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture and sell our products could be limited.",

      "question": "How do the specific compliance challenges related to Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws described by Abbott and Gilead impact their respective business operations in terms of regulatory scrutiny and potential financial penalties?",
      "answer": "Abbott faces compliance challenges under Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws, including anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws, which can result in regulatory enforcement actions, product seizures, revocation of billing privileges, and civil or criminal sanctions. These requirements significantly increase the cost and complexity of maintaining regulatory compliance. Similarly, Gilead is subject to U.S. federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which have led to increased scrutiny of its patient assistance programs, promotional speaker programs, and reimbursement support offerings. Violations of these laws could result in criminal and civil penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, and the imposition of Corporate Integrity Agreements. Both companies must invest heavily in compliance infrastructure to mitigate the risk of violations, which directly affects their operational costs and exposes them to financial and reputational risks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Regulation\n\nThe development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott's products are subject to comprehensive  government  regulation  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  similar  international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott's products, as well as the inspection of, and controls  over,  research  and  laboratory  procedures,  clinical  investigations,  product  approvals  and  manufacturing, labeling,  packaging,  supply  chains,  marketing  and  promotion,  pricing  and  reimbursement,  sampling,  distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott's clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration,  the  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  Administration,  and  their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 public health emergency, many pandemic-related products (including diagnostic tests) were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic. In addition, many governments enacted policies to  expedite  or  promote  access  to  health  care  in  order  to  slow  or  stop  the  spread  of  the  virus.  Examples  include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing. It is uncertain when the public health emergency will end and to what extent these policies will continue or revert back to previous policies.\n\nAbbott's international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott's investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.\n\nAbbott's laboratory facilities, home monitoring services,and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. In the United States, Medicare,  Medicaid,  and other third-party payors may  from  time  to time conduct  inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.\n\nAbbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal antikickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott's business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Device Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing  products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's  production  and  sale,  suspension  or  revocation  of  billing  privileges,  and  other  civil  or  criminal  sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing  services  requires  specialized  expertise.  Failure  to  comply  with  these  regulatory  requirements  can  result  in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.\n\nAbbott's business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care  products  and  their  components  that  are  regularly  conducted  by  industry  participants,  government  agencies,  and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.",

          "chunk_text": "As our products mature, pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices. Further, as new branded or generic products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  Item  1A  Risk  Factors  'Our  existing  products  are  subject  to  reimbursement  pressures  from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and other discounts on our products and other pricing pressures.' and 'We  face  challenges  in  accurately  forecasting  sales  because  of  the  difficulties  in  predicting  demand  for  our  products  and fluctuations in purchasing patterns or wholesaler inventories.'\n\n## Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws; Anti-Bribery Laws\n\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care 'fraud and abuse,' including anti-kickback laws and false  claim  laws. Anti-kickback  laws  make  it  illegal  for  a  prescription  drug  manufacturer  to  knowingly  and  willingly solicit,  offer,  receive  or  pay  any  remuneration  in  exchange  for,  or  to  induce,  the  referral  of  business  reimbursed  by  a  federal healthcare program, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly  presenting,  or  causing  to  be  presented,  a  false  or  fraudulent  claim  for  payment  by  federal  and  certain  state  payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. In addition, the FDA regulates written and verbal communications about our products. In addition to federal  law,  states  also  have  consumer  protection  and  false  claims  laws.  Due  to  the  breadth  of  the  statutory  provisions  and  the attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities, our sales, marketing, patient support, medical, clinical and public affairs  activities  may  be  subject  to  scrutiny  under  these  laws.  For  example,  recently  there  has  been  enhanced  scrutiny  by government enforcement authorities of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs and manufacturer donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance, reimbursement support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. Similarly, in Europe, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are subject to strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians' codes of professional conduct, as applicable, including the EU Member States anti-corruption laws and the UK Bribery Act 2010.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their  intermediaries  from  making  improper  payments  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  or  retaining  business.  Our  policies  mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom.\n\nDespite our training and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from unlawful acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of fraud and abuse laws or anti-bribery laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Violations can also lead to the imposition of a Corporate Integrity Agreement or similar government oversight program, even if we disagree with the government's perspective that we have violated any rules or guidance. Any  similar  violations  by  our  competitors  could  also  negatively  impact  the  reputation  of  our  industry  and  increase governmental and public scrutiny over our business and our products.\n\n## U.S. Healthcare Reform\n\nThe U.S. federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry, including legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing.\n\nFor more information, see Item 1A Risk Factors 'We are impacted by evolving laws, regulations and legislative or regulatory actions applicable to the health care industry.'\n\n## Environment\n\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations that require compliance with federal, state, and local regulations for the protection of the environment. The regulatory landscape continues to evolve, and we anticipate additional regulations in the future. Laws  and  regulations  are  implemented  and  under  consideration  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  climate  change  mainly  caused  by greenhouse gas emissions. Our business is not energy intensive. Therefore, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or other mitigation measure that would materially impact our capital expenditures, operations or competitive position.",

      "question": "How does Abbott's development of new indications for the FreeStyle Libre platform relate to Gilead's dependency on expanding indications for existing products in terms of their respective R&D strategies and long-term business sustainability?",
      "answer": "Abbott is developing new indications for the FreeStyle Libre platform to expand its use beyond diabetes management, which aligns with its broader R&D strategy in the diabetes care segment to improve patient outcomes and drive long-term growth. Similarly, Gilead emphasizes that its business sustainability depends on successfully launching new products or expanding indications for existing products like Yescarta and Tecartus, which are already FDA-approved. Both companies rely on indication expansion to offset revenue losses from maturing products and to justify their significant R&D investments. This shared focus highlights how expanding therapeutic applications is a critical, though high-risk, strategy for maintaining competitive advantage and financial stability in the healthcare sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott is developing 'enhancements and additional indications for the FreeStyle Libre platform of continuous glucose monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Gilead states, 'Our success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products,' and specifically references Yescarta and Tecartus, which are FDA-approved cell therapies.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Abbott and Gilead rely on expanding product indications as a core R&D and business growth strategy. Abbott's FreeStyle Libre expansion beyond diabetes parallels Gilead's efforts with cell therapies, both aiming to justify high R&D costs and offset revenue declines from existing products."

          "chunk_text": "In the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaced the existing  directives  in  the  EU  for  medical  devices  and  imposes  additional  premarket  and  post-market  regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. The MDR applies to manufacturers as of May 26, 2021 after a fouryear transition period. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the MDR.\n\nSome  products  require  submission  of  a  design  dossier  to  the  appropriate  regulatory  authority  for  review  and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which  includes  testing  results  and  clinical  evaluations  but  can  self-certify  its  ability  to  apply  the  CE  mark  to  the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions.\n\nAfter approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority.\n\nIn the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.\n\nIn  the  U.S.,  the  FDA  requires  that  it  be  notified  of  proposed  new  formulations  and  formulation  or  packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA's confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products.\n\n## Areas of Focus\n\nIn 2022 and beyond, Abbott's significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following:\n\nEstablished  Pharmaceuticals  - Abbott  focuses  on  building  country-specific  portfolios  made  up  of  high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product  portfolio  in  key  therapeutic  areas  with  the  aim  of  being  among  the  first  to  launch  new  off-patent  and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott  is  also  actively  working  on  the  further  development  of  several  key  brands  such  as  Creon\u2122,  Duphaston\u2122, Duphalac\u2122  and  Influvac\u2122.  Depending  on  the  product,  the  activities  focus  on  development  of  new  data,  markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications.\n\nMedical Devices - Abbott's research and development programs focus on:\n\n- Cardiac Rhythm Management - Development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies.\n- Heart  Failure  -  Continued  enhancements  to Abbott's  mechanical  circulatory  support  and  pulmonary  artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability.\n- Electrophysiology  -  Development  of  next-generation  technologies  in  the  areas  of  ablation,  diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording.\n- Vascular  -  Development  of  next-generation  technologies  for  use  in  coronary  and  peripheral  vascular procedures.\n- Structural Heart - Development of transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves, and occlusion therapies for congenital heart defects and stroke-risk reduction.\n- Neuromodulation - Development of additional clinical evidence and next-generation technologies leveraging digital  health  to  improve  patient  and  physician  engagement  to  treat  chronic  pain,  movement  disorders  and other indications.\n- Diabetes  Care  -  Develop  enhancements  and  additional  indications  for  the  FreeStyle  Libre  platform  of continuous glucose monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes.",

          "chunk_text": "The use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. While FDA has approved some cell therapies,  including Yescarta  and Tecartus,  we  must  continue  to  demonstrate  to  the  medical  community  the  potential advantages of cell therapy compared to existing and future therapeutics. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Yescarta and Tecartus, see also 'Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and other discounts on our products and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Yescarta or Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.\n\nWe  operate  a  new  automated  manufacturing  facility  in  Frederick,  Maryland.  The  facility  is  pending  FDA  approval  for commercial manufacturing and, even if we obtain such approval, we have not manufactured our products in an automated facility on a commercial scale. As a result, we may not be able to produce or otherwise obtain an amount of supply sufficient to satisfy demand for our products. If we are unable to meet product demand, we will have difficulty meeting sales forecasts for products that we plan to manufacture at this facility.\n\n## Our success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products.\n\nIf we are unable to launch commercially successful new products or new indications for existing products, our business will be adversely impacted. The launch of commercially successful products is necessary to grow our business, cover our substantial R&amp;D expenses, and offset revenue losses when existing products lose market share due to factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in drug development and the introduction of new products. The  product  development  cycle  is  characterized  by  significant  investments  of  resources,  long  lead  times  and  unpredictable outcomes due to the nature  of  developing  medicines  for  human  use. We  expend  significant  time  and  resources  on  our  product pipeline without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment.\n\n## We face challenges in accurately forecasting sales because of the difficulties in predicting demand for our products and fluctuations in purchasing patterns or wholesaler inventories.\n\nWe may be unable to accurately predict demand for our products, including the uptake of new products, as demand depends on  a  number  of  factors.  For  example,  product  demand  may  be  adversely  affected  if  physicians  do  not  see  the  benefit  of  our products. Additionally,  the  non-retail  sector  in  the  United  States,  which  includes  government  institutions,  including  state AIDS Drug  Assistance  Programs,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  correctional  facilities  and  large  health  maintenance organizations, tends to be less consistent in terms of buying patterns and often causes quarter-over-quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror patient demand for our products. Federal and state budget pressures, as well as the annual grant cycles for federal and state funds, may cause purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand for our products. We expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers. In light of the budget crises faced by many European countries, we have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some government agencies and other purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels, and we may continue to see this trend in the future.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the United States exclusively through the wholesale channel. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 91% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end-user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory  levels  to  actual  end-user  demand. As  a  result,  changes  in  inventory  levels  held  by  those  wholesalers  can  cause  our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers do not match end-user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and other non-wholesaler locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control  over  buying  patterns. Adverse  changes  in  economic  conditions,  increased  competition  or  other  factors  may  cause  retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and, consequently, the wholesalers' orders from us, even if end-user demand has not changed. In addition, we have observed that strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases of our products in the fourth quarter typically results in inventory draw-down by wholesalers and subwholesalers  in  the  subsequent  first  quarter. As  inventory  in  the  distribution  channel  fluctuates  from  quarter  to  quarter,  we  may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues.",

      "question": "How does the Inflation Reduction Act's government price-setting mechanism create reimbursement uncertainty for both AbbVie and Danaher, and by how much could AbbVie's revenues be affected if Imbruvica, Vraylar, and Linzess experience price reductions under Medicare Part D starting in 2026 and 2027?",
      "answer": "The Inflation Reduction Act introduces a government price-setting mechanism that directly impacts AbbVie and creates reimbursement uncertainty for Danaher. For AbbVie, the CMS selected Imbruvica in 2023 as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices under Medicare Part D, effective January 1, 2026. In 2025, Vraylar and Linzess were also selected for price setting beginning in 2027. These products are subject to price caps that represent a significant discount from average market prices, which could accelerate revenue erosion before patent expiration and reduce profitability. For Danaher, reimbursement uncertainty arises from its exposure to healthcare providers and laboratories that rely on Medicare reimbursement, particularly under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) affected by PAMA and the IRA. If Medicare reimbursement rates decline, it could reduce the prices Danaher receives for its diagnostic and laboratory products. The financial impact on AbbVie could be substantial, given that Imbruvica, Vraylar, and Linzess are major revenue-generating products now subject to IRA pricing constraints.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AbbVie's 2024 10-K reveals that Imbruvica was selected in 2023 for IRA price setting effective 2026, and Vraylar and Linzess were selected in 2025 for 2027 under Medicare Part D, with prices capped at a significant discount from average market prices.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Danaher's 2024 10-K states that healthcare providers and laboratories reliant on Medicare reimbursement (e.g., under CLFS and impacted by PAMA and IRA) may reduce demand or willingness to pay for Danaher's products if reimbursement rates are inadequate.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The IRA directly affects AbbVie's revenue outlook for key products through mandated price caps, while it indirectly impacts Danaher by reducing the reimbursement available to their customers, potentially lowering demand or pricing power for Danaher's medical and diagnostic products."

          "chunk_text": "Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.\n\nAbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\nCost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business-Regulation-Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing.\" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, European Union member states and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future.\n\nAbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, as well as federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, contribute to pricing pressures. In particular, the IRA will have the effect of reducing prices and reimbursements for certain of our products, which could significantly impact AbbVie's results of operations. Under the IRA, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services can effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices can apply as soon as nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. In August 2023, HHS, through the CMS, selected Imbruvica as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. In August 2024, the CMS published Medicare Part D prices that will be applicable to these medicines, including Imbruvica, beginning January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS, through the CMS, selected Vraylar and Linzess as two of the 15 medicines subject to government-set prices in Medicare Part D beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. In addition, beginning in January 2025, under the IRA, the 70% coverage gap discount program was replaced by a 10% manufacturer discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and i ncurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20% discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold under the new Part D benefit redesign. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. The IRA has and will continue to meaningfully impact AbbVie's business strategies and those of others in the pharmaceutical i ndustry. The full impact of the IRA on AbbVie's business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of our or a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nAbbVie continues to evaluate the impact that the IRA may have on the company. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries may result in additional pricing pressures.\n\nIn major markets worldwide, governments play a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries' pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in revenues and operating earnings.\n\nRebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

Ev en when we successfully innov ate and dev elop new and enhanced products and serv ices, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceiv ed efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achiev e positiv e clinical outcomes, uncertainty ov er third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market serv ices and parts for our products which may detract from our sales.\n\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serv e hav e undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, including the following:\n\n- Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on gov ernment funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and serv ices and research activ ities. The PPACA, healthcare austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and gov ernment austerity measures hav e reduced and may further reduce the amount of gov ernment funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and serv ices and/or the v olume of medical procedures using our products and serv ices. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 ('PAMA') introduced a multi-year pricing program for serv ices payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule ('CLFS') that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by priv ate payors. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect ov erall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing serv ices, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these serv ices is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains v arious drug price negotiation, inflationary rebate and gov ernment-established pricing prov isions with v arying implementation dates and subjects manufacturers who fail to adhere to the gov ernment's interpretation of the law to penalties. The recent change in U.S. administration may also result in changes that unfav orably impact the healthcare industry and our business.\n- Other countries, as well as some priv ate payors, also control the price of healthcare products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or cov erage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of gov ernmental entities) through compulsory licensing or limiting of intellectual property protections. For example, China has introduced programs designed to lower prices for medical products and reduce healthcare costs (including a v olume-based procurement program) that hav e unfav orably impacted our rev enues and may continue to adv ersely affect our business and financial statements. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adv ersely impact government funding and reimbursement.\n- Governmental and priv ate healthcare prov iders and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the deliv ery of healthcare serv ices, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of v endors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations, strategic alliances and integrated health deliv ery networks and pursuing consolidation to improv e their purchasing lev erage, using competitiv e bid processes to procure healthcare products and serv ices and inv esting in healthcare practices to increase their control ov er healthcare spending. Payors are also seeking to improv e price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases.\n\nThese changes as well as other impacts from market demand, gov ernment regulations, third-party cov erage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is deliv ered, reimbursed and funded and hav e in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serv e to purchase fewer of our products and serv ices, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or serv ices, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding av ailable for our products and serv ices from gov ernmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the v olume of medical procedures that use our products and serv ices, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and ev en if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negativ ely affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described abov e can adv ersely affect our business and financial statements.",

      "answer": "Merck reported that failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for its products, such as Keytruda, could adversely affect revenue. CVS noted that new distribution channels and marketplace entrants could make it more difficult to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits, including prescription drug coverage. If Keytruda were excluded from CVS Health's formulary, patients covered by CVS Health plans would likely face higher out-of-pocket costs or need to go through additional prior authorization steps, reducing access. For Merck, this would translate into lower sales volumes and potentially reduced revenue, especially in therapeutic categories where alternative treatments are available. This dual challenge would directly impact Merck\u2019s revenue projections and could affect patient treatment outcomes.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of CVS's consumer engagement challenges and Merck\u2019s formulary placement risk creates a scenario where Keytruda may be excluded from CVS Health's formulary, directly affecting patient access and Merck\u2019s revenue projections."

      "question": "How does the impact of volume-based procurement (VBP) in China on Merck's pharmaceutical pricing, combined with CVS's reliance on identifying opportunities for generic substitution, affect the financial dynamics between brand-name drug manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. health care ecosystem?",
      "answer": "Merck reports that in China, volume-based procurement (VBP) has led to an average price reduction of more than 50% for mature products, and new entries into the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) have averaged 60% price reductions. This pricing pressure is expected to continue semi-annually and significantly impact Merck\u2019s revenue from mature products. Meanwhile, CVS Health\u2019s Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) services rely on identifying opportunities for generic substitution as part of their prescription drug management for clients. This means that in the U.S. health care ecosystem, brand-name manufacturers like Merck face dual pressures: reduced pricing leverage in international markets and constrained utilization in domestic markets due to PBM-driven generic substitution. As a result, Merck\u2019s revenue from both existing and mature products may be significantly affected, while CVS benefits from cost savings passed on to clients, reinforcing the financial advantage of generic drugs in managed care models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CVS relies on identifying opportunities for generic substitution as part of its PBM services to manage prescription drugs for clients.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Merck reports that VBP in China has led to an average price reduction of more than 50% for mature products, with NRDL entries averaging 60% price cuts.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - These two facts together show how brand-name drug manufacturers like Merck face significant pricing pressure both internationally (due to VBP) and domestically (due to PBM practices like those at CVS), which collectively reduce revenue potential and increase reliance on generic alternatives in health care cost management."

      "question": "How does the Affordable Care Act's premium rate review process and minimum MLR requirements specifically constrain CVS's ability to manage medical cost trends, and how does this regulatory pressure compare to Merck's exposure to ACA-related pricing limitations in terms of impact on operating margins?",
      "answer": "The Affordable Care Act imposes a federal premium rate review process that applies to CVS when proposed rate increases meet or exceed a specified threshold, requiring additional public disclosure and review. This limits CVS\u2019s ability to price for the risk it assumes, which could adversely affect its medical benefit ratios (MBRs) and operating results, especially when medical cost trends exceed projections. Additionally, the ACA\u2019s minimum MLR requirements of 85% for large group and 80% for individual/small group commercial products cap the margin CVS can earn, exposing it to higher-than-expected medical costs and potentially triggering fines or premium refunds. In contrast, Merck faces ACA-related pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies, and exchanges, which constrain its ability to maintain profit margins. These pressures are compounded by formulary negotiations and the purchasing power of PBMs and health plans, directly affecting Merck\u2019s revenue and profitability. Both companies are constrained by ACA provisions, but in different ways\u2014CVS through pricing and regulatory compliance costs, Merck through reduced pricing power and formulary access.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The ACA requires CVS to undergo federal or state premium rate review for proposed increases exceeding a threshold, limiting its ability to price for assumed risk and affecting MBRs and operating results.",

Rales, env isioned a business that would generate sustainable long-term v alue for customers, associates and shareholders. Through a series of acquisitions and div estitures, Danaher has ev olv ed over time into the science and technology innov ator it is today. While the operating companies that make up Danaher hav e changed, DBS continues to be the guiding philosophy for the Company.\n\nSales in 2024 by geographic destination (geographic destination refers to the geographic area where the final sale to the Company's unaffiliated customer is made) as a percentage of total 2024 sales were: North America, 43% (including 42% in the United States); Western Europe, 23%; other developed markets, 5%; and high-growth markets, 29%. The Company defines North America as the United States and Canada. The Company defines high-growth markets as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America (including Mexico) and Asia (with the exception of Japan, Australia and New Zealand). The Company defines developed markets as all markets of the world that are not high-growth markets.\n\n## BIOTECHNOLOGY\n\nThe Biotechnology segment includes the bioprocessing and discov ery and medical businesses and offers a broad range of equipment, consumables and serv ices that are primarily used by customers to adv ance and accelerate the research, dev elopment, manufacture and deliv ery of biological medicines. The Company's solutions support a broad range of biotherapeutics including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, replacement therapies such as insulin and v accines, as well as nov el cell, gene, mRNA and other nucleic acid therapies. Sales in 2024 for this segment by geographic destination (as a percentage of total 2024 sales) were: North America, 33%; Western Europe, 34%; other dev eloped markets, 5%; and high-growth markets, 28%.\n\nDanaher established the Biotechnology segment through the acquisition of Pall in 2015, and expanded the business through the acquisition of Cytiv a in 2020.",

      "question": "How do the EU's centralized and decentralized medical device regulatory pathways, described in Amgen's 10-K, relate to the risks of foreign regulatory changes mentioned in Danaher's 10-K, particularly in light of China's promotion of local medical devices?",
      "answer": "Amgen's 10-K details the EU's centralized and decentralized regulatory approval pathways for biotech products, including the requirement for centralized approval for biotechnology-derived products and the role of the EMA and EC in final marketing authorization. Danaher's 10-K highlights the risk posed by national policies promoting domestic medical device industries, specifically referencing China's recent policies favoring local medical devices. The connection lies in how regulatory divergence\u2014such as China promoting local products\u2014could create barriers for multinational companies like Danaher, even as Amgen navigates complex EU pathways. This reflects a broader challenge where regulatory systems in key markets (EU and China) influence global market access and competition differently, affecting both companies\u2019 strategies and financial outcomes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen's 10-K describes the EU's centralized and decentralized regulatory procedures for biotech products, including the mandatory centralized pathway for biotechnology-derived products and the role of the EMA and EC.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Danaher's 10-K notes that national laws promoting domestic interests, such as China's policies to develop its local medical device industry, pose a risk to its business and financial performance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The EU's structured regulatory system contrasts with China's policy environment that favors domestic companies. This creates a dual challenge: Amgen must navigate a rigorous but predictable EU regulatory framework, while Danaher faces unpredictable market access risks due to regulatory shifts favoring local producers in key markets like China."

          "chunk_text": "## Regulation outside the United States\n\nIn EU countries as well as in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States.\n\nIn the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure , identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies.  Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment-based on safety, quality and efficacy-is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure , which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA's CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally follows the CHMP's opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval.\n\nIn the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, an applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired, relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is 'highly similar' with regard to quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future .\n\nIn the EU, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, provides that a medicine can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the EC if its sponsor can establish that: (i) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (ii) either (a) such conditions affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the EU, or even if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. An application for the designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product may be submitted at any stage of development of the medicinal product but before the filing of an MAA. A marketing authorization for an orphan medicinal product may only include indications  designated as orphan.  For non-orphan indications treated with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, a separate marketing authorization has to be sought. Approved orphan drugs in the EU receive 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication in all EU member states. We currently have orphan medicinal product designation for BLINCYTO in the EU and intend to seek medicinal product designation for a number of our products in the future.\n\nOther countries such as those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical-trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, regulatory timelines can be less predictable.  The  regulatory  process  may  also  include  manufacturing/testing  facility  inspections,  testing  of  drug  product  upon  importation  and  other  domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that would allow for submissions under more-competitive time frames. With regard to biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea).\n\nIn some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby manufacturers must establish that their medical devices conform to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements.",

For example, certain gov ernments hav e implemented policies to induce 're-shoring' of supply chains, reduce reliance on imported supplies and promote national production. The Chinese gov ernment has issued a series of policies in the past several years to promote the dev elopment and use of local medical dev ices. In addition, in recent years the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain imported goods and trade tensions between China and other countries (including the U.S.) hav e escalated, with countries imposing significant additional tariffs on a wide range of imported goods. Following the recent change of administration in the U.S., new tariffs hav e been implemented and hav e prompted retaliatory tariffs by certain countries, further tariffs my follow and the risks noted abov e hav e increased. The full impact of these tariffs on the Company and our business partners remains uncertain.\n\n## Our business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our Code of Conduct, protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that v iolate laws, including the laws gov erning payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behav ior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data priv acy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to gov ernment officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that hav e experienced gov ernmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civ il or criminal inv estigations and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civ il and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and inv estigatory fees.

      "question": "How does the FDA's regulation of biosimilars under the Affordable Care Act impact Amgen's ability to maintain exclusivity for its originator biologic products like TEPEZZA and UPLIZNA, and how does this compare to the regulatory exclusivity period for medical devices cleared through the 510(k) pathway that DHR relies on?",
      "answer": "Amgen benefits from a 12-year exclusivity period under the Affordable Care Act, during which the FDA cannot approve biosimilars based on Amgen's originator data for products like TEPEZZNA and UPLIZNA. This provides a longer window of market exclusivity without direct biosimilar competition. In contrast, DHR's medical devices that receive clearance through the 510(k) pathway do not receive a comparable exclusivity period; instead, they can be subject to competition as soon as another manufacturer demonstrates 'substantial equivalence' to the cleared device. Therefore, Amgen's regulatory exclusivity is significantly longer and more protective than the de facto exclusivity DHR experiences with its 510(k)-cleared devices.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that Amgen's originator biologics receive a 12-year exclusivity period under the Affordable Care Act, during which the FDA cannot approve biosimilars based on Amgen's data.",

          "chunk_text": "- In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects.\n- In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a patient population larger than phase 1 but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study.\n- In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates, compared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.\n\nThe FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on data accumulated to that point and the FDA's risk-benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a BLA for biologic products or a New Drug Application for small molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application.\n\nApproval of Biosimilars . The Affordable Care Act authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical-trial and clinical-trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated  to  be  'highly  similar'  and  to  have  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  with  regard  to  safety,  purity  and  potency.  The  relevance  of  demonstrating 'similarity' is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, because riskbenefit has previously been established. To preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators' products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator's data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial  FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. As part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, the FDA released a number of guidance documents, some of which remain in draft form. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future .\n\nRegulation of Product Marketing and Promotion .  The  FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products.  Our product promotions for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDA's implemented regulations and guidance. The FDA's review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare-provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications  to  healthcare  professionals,  promotional  programming  and  promotional  activities  involving  electronic  media.  The  FDA  may  also  review  industrysponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for violations of the FDA's advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the  FDA's  regulations  also  can  result  in  adverse  publicity  or  increased  scrutiny  of  company  activities  by  the  U.S.  Congress  or  other  legislators. Additionally,  as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws.\n\nRegulation of Manufacturing Standards .  The  FDA regulates and inspects the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location  or  process,  additional  regulatory  review  may  be  required.  We  also  must  adhere  to  current  G ood  Manufacturing  Practice  regulations  and  product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval.\n\nRegulation of Combination Products . Combination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well.\n\nRegulation of Orphan Medicines. Orphan drugs are defined by the FDA as products intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States. A company must request orphan drug designation prior to filing and, if granted for being the first medicine to treat such a rare disease, means the FDA will not approve another sponsor's marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another medicine for the same indication if it is shown to be clinically superior. In the United States, a number of our products, including products such as TEPEZZA and UPLIZNA, have orphan drug exclusivity under this framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## Regulatory Matters\n\nThe Company faces extensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to its operations, including the dev elopment, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of its products and serv ices. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that the Company is subject to. These are not the only regulations that the Company's businesses must comply with. For a description of the risks related to the regulations that the Company's businesses are subject to, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Medical Device Regulations\n\nMany of our products are classified as medical dev ices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the 'FDCA'). The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effectiv e for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA'). The FDA regulates the design, dev elopment, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, adv ertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export and record keeping for such products. Many medical dev ice products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.\n\nUnless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical dev ice or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approv al ('PMA') before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the dev ice. The FDA classifies medical dev ices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a dev ice and the lev el of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the dev ice's safety and effectiv eness.\n\nThe process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data, which in some cases can be extensiv e, to demonstrate that the dev ice is 'substantially equiv alent' to a dev ice that was on the market before 1976 or to a dev ice that has been found by the FDA to be 'substantially equiv alent' to such a pre-1976 dev ice. As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the dev elopment process for a considerable length of time.\n\nMedical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approv ed. After a dev ice has receiv ed 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiv eness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approv al and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the dev ice's safety or effectiv eness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; howev er, the FDA may rev iew this determination to ev aluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified dev ice until the required 510(k) clearance or PMA approv al is obtained.\n\nAny medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to perv asiv e and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state and non-U.S. agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices ('CGMP') requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems Regulation ('QSR'), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process.\n\nWe must also comply with post-market surv eillance regulations, including medical dev ice reporting ('MDR') requirements which require that we rev iew and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may hav e caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.\n\nLabeling and promotional activ ities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') (and similar regulators in other jurisdictions). Medical dev ices approv ed or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapprov ed or uncleared uses, otherwise known as 'off-label' promotion. The FDA and other agencies activ ely enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\n\nIn the European Union ('EU'), our products are subject to the medical dev ice and in v itro medical dev ice laws of the v arious member states, which for many years were based on Directiv es of the European Commission. Howev er, in May 2017, the EU adopted new, formal regulations to replace such Directiv es; specifically, the EU Medical Dev ice Regulation (the 'MDR') and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the 'IVDR'), each of which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical dev ices and in v itro dev ices, including in the area of clinical ev aluation requirements,",

          "chunk_text": "addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D.\n\nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 70% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or \"donut hole.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.\n\nAbbVie expects debate to continue during 2022 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is difficult to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.\n\nEuropean Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products.\n\nMost governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems.\n\nJapan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available.\n\nEmerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals.\n\nSince AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action.",

The Company regards its intellectual property as having significant value in the Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments. The Company is not aware of any facts that could materially impact the continuing use of any of its intellectual property.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and comparable multiple levels of international regulation in the jurisdictions in which it does business. There also continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by federal, state and international regulators of the health and related benefits industry's business and reporting practices. In addition, many of the Company's PBM clients and the Company's payors in the Retail/LTC segment, including insurers, Medicare plans, Managed Medicaid plans and MCOs, are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor. Similarly, the Company's LTC clients, such as skilled nursing facilities, are subject to government regulations, including many of the same government regulations to which the Company is subject.\n\nThe laws and rules governing the Company's businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year and are subject to frequent change. The application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of the Company's businesses creates areas of uncertainty. Further, there are numerous proposed health care, financial services and other laws and regulations at the federal, state and international levels, some of which could adversely affect the Company's businesses if they are enacted. The Company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change aspects of how it operates in the specific markets in which it competes or the health care industry generally, but if changes occur, the impact of any such changes could have a material adverse impact on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or stock price. Possible regulatory or legislative changes include the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring the Commercial, Medicare or Medicaid marketplace; reducing payments to the Company in connection with Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible or special needs programs; increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing, purchasing, and/or importation; or changing the laws governing PBMs.\n\nThe Company has internal control policies and procedures and conducts training and compliance programs for its employees to help prevent, detect and correct prohibited practices. However, if the Company's employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing its international or other operations, it may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations summarized below, or any adverse applications or interpretations of, or changes in, the laws and regulations affecting the Company and/or its businesses, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition, cash flows and/or stock price. See Item 3 of this 10-K, 'Legal Proceedings,' for further information.\n\nThe Company can give no assurance that its businesses, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected, or that the Company will not be required to materially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations, including the laws and regulations described in this Government Regulation section, as they may relate to one or more of the Company's businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of one or more of the Company's businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iv) pending or future government audits, investigations or enforcement actions against the Company; or (v) adverse developments",

        "Step 3: The combined fair value is calculated by summing ABBV's $50 million and CVS's $4,281 million, resulting in $4,331 million.",
        "Step 4: The valuation methodologies differ: ABBV uses only Level 2 inputs for its debt securities, while CVS uses both Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, with Level 2 being the dominant method."

      "question": "How might a product withdrawal due to safety concerns impact both AbbVie's market acceptance and CVS's specialty pharmacy business, given AbbVie's exposure to product liability claims and CVS's reliance on prescription drug utilization?",
      "answer": "A product withdrawal due to safety concerns could negatively impact AbbVie's market acceptance by reducing demand for its products, as seen in the case of real or perceived safety issues leading to lower sales. This is compounded by AbbVie's exposure to product liability claims, such as those related to Allergan's textured breast implants, which could lead to reputational damage, additional costs, and decreased market share. For CVS, such a withdrawal could reduce prescription utilization, which is critical to its specialty pharmacy business.

Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products.\n\nNew data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products.\n\n## AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. For example, lawsuits are pending against Allergan, AbbVie's recently acquired subsidiary, and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's textured breast implants. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured.\n\nAbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to the intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Additionally, Allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3,130 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers and additional suits may be filed. See Note 15, \"Legal Proceedings and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" AbbVie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\n\n## AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\nCost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business-Regulation-Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing.\" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future.\n\nAbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures.\n\nIn numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings.\n\nRebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.",

Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business, operating results and cash flows.\n\n## We face risks relating to the availability, pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell.\n\nThe profitability of our Retail/LTC and Pharmacy Services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. We dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs from our retail, LTC, specialty and mail order pharmacies, and the retail pharmacies in our PBM's network also dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs. Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions for drugs or the utilization of drugs is reduced, including due to:\n\n- increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions;\n- manufacturing or other supply issues;\n- a reduction in drug manufacturers' participation in federal programs;\n- certain products being withdrawn by their manufacturers or transitioned to over-the-counter products;\n- future FDA rulings restricting the supply or increasing the cost of products;\n- the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs or lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products; or\n- inflation in the price of drugs.\n\nIn addition, increased utilization of generic drugs (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs) has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail, mail order, specialty and LTC pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in our margins on sales of generic drugs. Consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic drugs and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nThe reserves we hold for expected claims in our Insured Health Care Benefits products are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable. Any reserve, including a premium deficiency reserve, may be insufficient. If actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially adversely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.\n\nA large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to our members. Our reported health care costs payable for any particular period reflect our estimates of the ultimate cost of such claims as well as claims that have been reported to us but not yet paid. We also must estimate the amount of rebates payable under the MLR rules of the ACA, CMS and the OPM and the amounts payable by us to, and receivable by us from, the United States federal government under the ACA's remaining premium stabilization program.\n\nOur estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors, including those derived from historical claim experience, but this estimation process also makes use of extensive judgment. Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns and/or procedures, turnover and other changes in membership, changes in product mix, changes in the utilization of medical and/or other covered services, including prescription drugs, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products. We estimate health care costs payable periodically, and any resulting adjustments, including premium deficiency reserves, are reflected in current-period operating results within benefit costs. For example, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we established a premium deficiency reserve of $16 million and $11 million, respectively, related to Medicaid products in the Health Care Benefits segment. A worsening (or improvement) of health care cost trend rates or changes in claim payment patterns from those that we assumed in estimating health care costs payable as of December 31, 2021 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\n\nFurthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited, which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These risks are particularly acute during and following periods when utilization of medical and/or other covered services and/or medical cost trends are below",

      "answer": "The BPCIA creates a regulatory and legal framework that allows biosimilar manufacturers to challenge the patents of innovator companies like Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly before the expiration of data protection periods. Johnson & Johnson notes that competitors can use the BPCIA to initiate patent challenges as early as four years after a biologic's initial approval, potentially leading to a rapid loss of revenue if patents are invalidated or not infringed. Eli Lilly highlights that the BPCIA allows biosimilar applicants to bypass the formal patent litigation scheme and instead proceed directly to commercialization, forcing innovators to rely on traditional patent enforcement. Additionally, both companies face the risk of inter partes review (IPR) proceedings, which are used by competitors to challenge the validity of patents with a lower standard of proof than in federal court. This weakens the protection of intellectual property and increases the likelihood of market erosion from biosimilars, especially since the 12-year data protection period under the BPCIA does not prevent early legal challenges. These dynamics heighten the financial risk for both companies by threatening the exclusivity and profitability of their biologic products.",

A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\n\nSee Note 8, 'Income Taxes' under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\n\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company's expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\n## The Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\n\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company's businesses and materially important to the Company's results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\n\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company's owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company's products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\n\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim noninfringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\n\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the 'at-risk' launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company's patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, 'Legal Proceedings-Intellectual Property' under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Risks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\n\n## Significant challenges or delays in the Company's innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company's long-term success.\n\nThe Company's continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers.

          "chunk_text": "Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks consisting of our product names, logos, and unique product appearances (e.g., the appearance of our Trulicity autoinjector) which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world, with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered. Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms. Trademark protection typically extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product.\n\n## Patent Licenses and Collaborations\n\nMost of our major products are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreements. For information on our license and collaboration agreements, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\"\n\n## Patent Challenges\n\nIn the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the HatchWaxman Act, authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics, which are discussed below in more detail) when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only \"pharmaceutical equivalence\" and \"bioequivalence\" between the generic version and the NDAapproved drug-not safety and efficacy. Establishing pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company.\n\nAbsent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator's patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more or all of the patents listed in the innovator's NDA are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a \"Paragraph IV certification.\" If the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer, the FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic company's application for a 30-month period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the NDAlisted patents are challenged, the first filer(s) of a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers.\n\nGeneric manufacturers use Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition, generic companies have shown willingness to launch \"at risk,\" i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge.\n\nUnder the BPCIA, the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires, 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However, the BPCIA does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator's patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.\n\nThe patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA, and the BPCIA itself, is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA as well as courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. Further, in the U.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. See also \"- Competition - Biosimilars.\" In addition, there is a procedure in U.S. patent law, known as inter partes review (IPR), which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court. In addition, the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators. We expect additional changes to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), including potentially to the policy to discretionarily deny an otherwise meritorious petition for IPR in light of a concurrent district court proceeding. See \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected.\"",

New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.\n\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients' and healthcare providers' future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company's products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.\n\n## Risks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\n\n## The Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally .\n\nThe Company's extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2021, approximately 50% of the Company's sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 19% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company's revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company's non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\n\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company's operating results.\n\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company's sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\n\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company's business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;",

See Item 1, \"Business - Raw Materials and Product Supply,\" for more details.\n\n- Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely on third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances, and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product and clinical development, manufacturing, commercialization, hosting of, and support for, information technology systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. As examples, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations and the distribution of our products through logistics providers. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of confidential and proprietary information relating to us, our clinical trial subjects, or patients; may experience disruption or fail to perform due to information technology system vulnerabilities, breaches, cyber-attacks, or inadequate controls or procedures; may be unable to satisfy their commitments to us in which case we may not be able to achieve acceptable alternative sourcing; or may fail to perform at all. The foregoing risks may be heightened in jurisdictions outside the U.S., where we may face additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, privacy, security, or other obligations to us, our clinical trial subjects, and our patients could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Government Regulation\n\n- Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business.\n\nPublic and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medicines. These pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income. Governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of, and actions intended to address, pricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical products. Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including as a result of the regulatory priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration and other regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our business and revenue. For example, pending legislation in the U.S. could result in government negotiation of the price of some of our medicines, including insulin. Furthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, or private payers, such as the recently proposed Alzheimer's Monoclonal Antibody NCD, may adversely impact our business and financial results. However, we cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of current and future health care reform efforts. We also may continue to experience potential additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world.\n\nFor more details, see Item 1, \"Business - Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access,\" Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access,\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16: Contingencies.\"\n\n- Changes in foreign currency rates, interest rate risks, or inflation could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, interest rate risk from our exposure to floating and variable interest rates, and inflation risk from existing and expected rates of inflation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates, interest rates, and inflation can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson highlights that patent expirations typically lead to the introduction of competing generic or biosimilar products, which can cause significant revenue and market share losses. This reflects a forward-looking financial risk tied to the lifecycle of patented drugs. In contrast, Eli Lilly incurred a $339.7 million inventory impairment charge related to its COVID-19 antibodies due to changes in forecasted demand and near-term expiry dates, illustrating a risk tied to overproduction and demand volatility during the early lifecycle phase of a product. Together, these examples show how lifecycle stages\u2014early production and later patent loss\u2014pose distinct financial challenges in pharmaceutical product management.",

Management and representatives of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management's assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as 'plans,' 'expects,' 'will,' 'anticipates,' 'estimates' and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company's Consumer Health business; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.\n\nBecause forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company's actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\n## Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition\n\n- Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company's continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;\n- Challenges to the Company's ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;\n- The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;\n- Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company's patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;\n- Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;\n- Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;\n- Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and\n- Allegations that the Company's products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.\n\n## Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity\n\n- Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;\n- The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;",

          "chunk_text": "The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.\n\nIn addition to the development of new products, delivery devices, and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.\n\n## Regulation-Discovery and Clinical Development\n\nUnited States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).\n\nCompliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections associated with clinical development may include the sponsor, investigator sites, laboratories, hospitals and manufacturing facilities of AbbVie's subcontractors or other thirdparty manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including rejection of an NDA or BLA.\n\nEven if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or 'off-label' uses along with other labeling restrictions.\n\nOutside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency. After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.\n\nIn Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application.\n\nSimilarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial.",

Further regulatory agency requirements may result in a more challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for, among other things, additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval, or increased post-approval requirements. For these and other reasons discussed in this Risk Factors section, we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.\n\n## POST-AUTHORIZATION/APPROVAL DATA\n\nAs a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product, the FDA may require additional clinical trials or other studies. The results generated in these trials could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects, efficacy or safety. Regulatory agencies in countries outside the U.S. often have similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements. Postmarketing studies and clinical trials, whether conducted by us or by others, whether mandated by regulatory agencies or conducted voluntarily, and other emerging data about products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as one of our products, those concerns could implicate the entire class; and this, in turn, could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as other products in the class. The potential regulatory and commercial implications of post-marketing study results typically cannot immediately be determined. For example, in December 2021, in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance (A3921133), the U.S. label for Xeljanz was revised. Updates include a new boxed warning for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and updated boxed warnings regarding mortality, malignancies and thrombosis (with corresponding updates to applicable warnings and precautions). In addition, indications for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA or active PsA, and patients who are two years of age and older with active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis have been revised; Xeljanz is now indicated in patients who have had inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor blockers. In addition, at the request of the EC, the PRAC of the EMA has adopted a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to assess safety information relating to oral JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases, including Xeljanz and Cibinqo, which is ongoing. We continue to work with regulatory agencies to review the full results and analyses of ORAL Surveillance and their impact on product labeling.\n\nThe terms of our EUA for Comirnaty require that we conduct post-authorization observational studies in patients at least 5 years of age or older who received a booster dose, or other populations of interest including healthcare workers, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and subpopulations with specific comorbidities. Additionally, in relation to the FDA approval for Comirnaty, we are required to complete certain postmarketing study requirements and commitments by 2024 as identified in the August 2021 approval letter. The terms of our EUA for Paxlovid require monitoring for convergence of global viral variants of SARS-CoV-2 and potential assessment of Paxlovid activity against identified global variants of interest. Additionally, in relation to the potential FDA approval for Paxlovid, we are required to complete certain other analyses and studies as identified in the December 2021 authorization letter.\n\n## LEGAL MATTERS\n\nWe are and may be involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, including personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, commercial and other asserted and unasserted matters, environmental, government investigations, employment, tax litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nClaims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations.\n\nGovernment investigations and actions could result in substantial fines and/or criminal charges and civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions, as well as reputational harm, including as a result of increased public interest in the matter. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.\n\nOur sales and marketing activities and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the FCPA and other federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the Anti-Kickback Statute, antibribery laws, the False Claims Act, and similar laws in international jurisdictions. In addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws, the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation, settlement precedent, advisory opinions, and special fraud alerts. Our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments. Requirements or industry standards in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions. If an interaction is found to be improper, government enforcement actions and penalties could result. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time-to-time received, and may receive in the future, inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities. In addition, we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities, brought by governmental authorities, as well as consumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. Such claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged non-compliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product (approved and unapproved) information, potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including social media, mobile applications and blogger outreach.\n\nIn connection with the resolution of a U.S. government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, in 2018, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is effective for a period of five years. In the CIA, we agreed to implement and/or maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirements.

      "question": "How does the exclusivity timeline for ibrutinib (Imbruvica), as described in AbbVie's 2022 10-K, relate to Pfizer's revenue dependency on the product as noted in its 2022 10-K?",
      "answer": "AbbVie's 10-K states that the U.S. composition of matter patent for ibrutinib (Imbruvica) is expected to expire in 2027, but no generic entry is expected before March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted. This extended exclusivity period protects the product from generic competition until 2032. Pfizer's 10-K lists Imbruvica among its major products that generated over $1 billion in direct product and/or Alliance revenues in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Therefore, Pfizer's continued revenue from Imbruvica is safeguarded until 2032 due to AbbVie's extended exclusivity, allowing Pfizer to benefit from the product\u2019s market exclusivity for over a decade beyond the patent expiration.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AbbVie's 10-K states that the U.S. composition of matter patent for ibrutinib expires in 2027, but no generic entry is expected before March 30, 2032, due to potential pediatric exclusivity.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Pfizer's 10-K states that Imbruvica (ibrutinib) generated over $1 billion in direct product and/or Alliance revenues in 2021, 2020, and 2019.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since Pfizer relies on Imbruvica as a billion-dollar revenue product and AbbVie controls its exclusivity until 2032, Pfizer benefits from the extended exclusivity period, which delays generic competition and sustains revenue."

          "chunk_text": "individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA's reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.\n\nBiologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products.\n\nAbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications.\n\nThese patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2022 to the early 2040s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie's business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the company's business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the licenses in the United States will begin in 2023 and the licenses in Europe began in 2018.\n\nIn addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica) and those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027, however no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033.\n\nAbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie's trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie's employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.",

Pfizer and BioNTech equally share the costs of development for the Comirnaty program. Comirnaty/BNT162b2 has been granted an approval or an authorization in many countries around the world in populations varying by country. We also share gross profits equally from commercialization of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and are working jointly with BioNTech in our respective territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by market. For discussion on Comirnaty/BNT162b2, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-COVID-19 Pandemic section within MD&amp;A.\n- Eliquis (apixaban) is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with BMS as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate patients. We fund between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study, and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countries where we commercialize Eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to BMS. In certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers.\n- Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas. We share equally in the gross profits and losses related to U.S. net sales and also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we share certain development and other collaboration expenses. For international net sales we receive royalties based on a tiered percentage.\n- Bavencio (avelumab) is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. We jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs and split profits equally related to net sales generated from any products containing avelumab.\n- Orgovyx (relugolix) is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and commercialized with Myovant.

          "chunk_text": "## Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements\n\nIn addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, nonrefundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements-Other Licensing &amp; Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n## Third Party Agreements\n\nAbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption.\n\nAbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements-Other Licensing &amp; Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n## Sources and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nAbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by COVID-19, AbbVie has continued to supply patients with no material supply impact, except for the previously-disclosed near-term supply issues impacting Lupron. Given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic, AbbVie is monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may impact the fulfillment of product demand.\n\n## Research and Development Activities\n\nAbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie's existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions.\n\nThe research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:\n\n- Phase 1- involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for later phases.\n- Phase 2- tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy.\n- Phase 3- tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval.\n\nPreclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar",

      "question": "What was the total amount of upfront and milestone payments made by both BMY and GILD to Dragonfly for their respective immunotherapy programs, and how did the termination of these programs affect each company's financial obligations?",
      "answer": "BMY paid Dragonfly $175 million in 2022 as a Phase I development milestone for the IL-12 program and had previously obtained the global exclusive license in 2020. In 2023, BMY terminated the agreement, reverting all rights back to Dragonfly, which effectively ended BMY\u2019s future financial obligations for this program. GILD made a $300 million upfront payment to Dragonfly in April 2022 for the DF7001 program and an additional $15 million in August 2022 related to target selection. In July 2023, GILD and Dragonfly mutually agreed to terminate the DF7001 program, which likely ended GILD\u2019s future milestone and royalty obligations under this specific program. Therefore, the total payments made were $175 million (BMY) and $315 million (GILD), with both companies no longer obligated to make further payments after termination.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that BMY paid Dragonfly $175 million in 2022 as a Phase I development milestone for the IL-12 program and had obtained the license in 2020. Also note that BMY terminated the agreement in 2023, reverting all rights to Dragonfly.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract that GILD paid $300 million upfront to Dragonfly in April 2022 for DF7001 and an additional $15 million in August 2022 for target selection. Also note that GILD and Dragonfly mutually terminated the DF7001 program in July 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that both companies made significant payments to Dragonfly for immunotherapy programs, but both agreements were terminated in 2023, ending further financial obligations beyond the payments already made."

      "question": "Given BMY's receipt of Fast Track Designation for milvexian from the FDA and GILD's description of the Fast Track pathway as a tool to expedite development and review for drugs treating serious conditions with unmet medical need, how might this regulatory strategy influence BMY's projected time-to-market and associated cost efficiencies for milvexian, particularly in light of the drug's development across three Phase III trials?",
      "answer": "BMY's receipt of Fast Track Designation for milvexian, an investigational oral factor XIa inhibitor being studied in three Phase III trials (Librexia STROKE, Librexia ACS, and Librexia AF), aligns with GILD\u2019s description of the Fast Track pathway as a mechanism to expedite development and review for drugs addressing serious conditions with unmet medical need. This designation likely accelerates BMY\u2019s development timeline, potentially reducing time-to-market and associated costs. The Fast Track pathway allows for more frequent FDA interactions and the possibility of rolling review, which can streamline the submission process. Given that milvexian is being evaluated across three distinct indications, the Fast Track status may enable parallel development efficiencies and earlier access to patients, enhancing BMY\u2019s competitive positioning and potentially improving the drug\u2019s commercial outlook.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BMY received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for milvexian across three Phase III trials: Librexia STROKE, Librexia ACS, and Librexia AF.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - GILD describes Fast Track Designation as a tool used by the FDA to expedite the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BMY\u2019s use of Fast Track for milvexian aligns with the FDA\u2019s expedited development tools described by GILD, suggesting a shortened development timeline and potential cost savings, especially across multiple indications."

      "answer": "Gilead disclosed a total of $525 million in settlements related to antitrust litigation with the direct purchaser class and retailer opt-out plaintiffs in 2023. In contrast, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) explicitly states that it is unable to estimate the possible losses or range of losses it may face in the European patent disputes with Teva over Eliquis, as the outcomes of these legal matters remain uncertain. Therefore, while Gilead's financial exposure has been quantified and settled, BMS's exposure remains indeterminate and could potentially exceed the $525 million settled by Gilead, depending on the outcomes of the pending legal proceedings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Gilead settled claims with the direct purchaser class and retailer opt-out plaintiffs for $525 million in the second half of 2023.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the two, Gilead\u2019s financial liability in its antitrust litigation has been quantified and resolved, whereas BMS faces indeterminate exposure in its patent litigation with Teva, which could be higher or lower than $525 million but remains unquantified as of the 2023 reporting period."

We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.  For  a  description  of  our  significant  pending  legal  proceedings,  see  Note  13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trade Secrets\n\nWe also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property.\n\n## Raw Materials and Manufacturing\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain through inventory management, relationship management and the evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.\n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2024, these facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials.\n- La V erne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim.

      "question": "How do cost containment measures specifically affect Gilead's European inventory levels and Medtronic's third-party payment approvals, and what are the resulting financial implications for each company?",
      "answer": "Gilead experiences reduced inventory levels in Europe due to cost containment measures, where government agencies and other purchasers have cut back on holding inventory as a result of budget pressures. This leads to fluctuations in purchasing patterns that do not reflect actual patient demand and may result in lower sales volumes. Meanwhile, Medtronic faces challenges from cost-containment efforts by third-party payors, such as government programs and private insurers, which could lead to patients being unable to obtain payment approvals for procedures using Medtronic's components. This would result in decreased sales of its components and finished medical devices. The financial implications for Gilead include potential revenue mismatches with patient demand, while Medtronic risks reduced profitability and customer losses due to declining payment approvals.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Gilead notes that European cost containment measures have caused government purchasers to reduce inventory levels, leading to mismatched sales and demand.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Medtronic states that third-party payors' cost containment efforts may prevent patients from obtaining payment approvals, leading to reduced sales of medical devices incorporating its components.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that both companies are impacted by cost containment policies, but through different financial and operational mechanisms: Gilead through inventory reduction and Medtronic through reimbursement decline."

          "chunk_text": "We  also  face  risks  related  to  our  in-house  CAR  T-cell  therapy  manufacturing  facilities  in  California,  Maryland  and  the  Netherlands,  spanning  process development,  vector  manufacturing,  clinical  trial  production  and  commercial  product  manufacturing.  Quality,  reliability  and  speed  are  critical  in  cell  therapy manufacturing to quickly and safely deliver our cell therapies to patients. Any delays or quality issues with our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business and damage our reputation. In addition, we may not be able to sufficiently increase manufacturing network capacity to meet growing demand.\n\n## Our success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products.\n\nIf we are unable to launch commercially successful new products or new indications for existing products, including approval for earlier lines of therapy, our business will be adversely impacted. The launch of commercially successful products is necessary to grow our business, cover our substantial R&amp;D expenses, and offset revenue losses when existing products lose market share due to factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in drug development and the introduction of new products. The product development cycle is characterized by significant investments of resources, long lead times and unpredictable outcomes due to the nature of developing medicines for human use. We expend significant time and resources on our product pipeline as well as on preparations for potential commercial launch without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. Such failures have had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on our business and financial results, including as a result of our inability to recover R&amp;D, clinical trial, acquisition-related and other ex penses incurred in connection with the development of and launch preparations for our product candidates. For example, we enter into commitments to purchase materials and supplies in anticipation of the potential manufacture and sale of new product candidates, and in the event the development, approval or launch of these product candidates is delayed or otherwise unsuccessful, we may experience excess inventory that needs to be written down, losses on firm commitments to purchase inventory, or other costs and expenses resulting from such commitments.\n\n## We face challenges in accurately forecasting sales because of the difficulties in predicting demand for our products and fluctuations in purchasing patterns or wholesaler inventories.\n\nWe may be unable to accurately predict demand for our products as demand depends on a number of factors. If we do not accurately forecast demand or manufacture products at levels to align with actual demand, then we may experience product shortages or build excess inventory that may need to be written off. For example, product demand may be adversely affected if physicians do not see the benefit of our products. Additionally, uptake of new products may not materialize as expected, or at all in the case of unsuccessful product candidates. For example, V eklury sales generally reflect COVID-19 related rates and severity of infections and hospitalizations, as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of vaccines and alternative treatments for COVID-19, and future sales in the short- and long-term remain uncertain.\n\nAdditionally, the non-retail sector in the U.S., which includes government institutions, including state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be less consistent in terms of buying patterns and often causes quarterover-quarter fluctuations that do not mirror actual patient demand for our products. Federal and state budget pressures, as well as the annual grant cycles for federal and state funds, may cause purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand for our products. We expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers. In light of the budget crises faced by many European countries, we have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some government agencies and other purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels, and we may continue to see this trend in the future.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the U.S. exclusively through the wholesaler/distributor channel. Historically, approximately 90% of our product sales in the U.S. have been to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., Cencora, Inc., and McKesson Corporation, and their specialty distributor affiliates. The U.S. wholesalers and distributors with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end-user demand and may not be accurate in matching their inventory levels to actual end-user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers and distributors can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers and distributors do not match end-user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail and specialty pharmacies and other non-wholesaler/distributor locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic conditions, increased competition or other factors may cause retail and specialty pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and distributors and, consequently, the wholesalers' and distributors' orders from us, even if enduser demand has not changed. In addition, we have observed that strong wholesaler/distributor and sub-wholesaler/distributor purchases of our products in the second half of the year typically results in inventory draw-down by wholesalers/distributors and sub-wholesalers/distributors in the subsequent first quarter. As inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues.",

Tariff  ex clusions  awarded  to  Medtronic  by  the  U.S. Government require periodic renewal, and policies for granting exclusions could shift. The U.S. and China, which comprises approximately seven percent of our total revenues, could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect Medtronic's access to the markets.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions and export restrictions are creating barriers to doing business in Russia and Belarus and adversely impacting global supply chains. While we have no manufacturing, distribution or direct material suppliers in the region, we continue to closely monitor the potential raw material/sub-tier supplier impact in both Russia and Ukraine including materials like palladium and neon, which are both dependent on Russia supply. Additional sanctions, export restrictions, and potential countermeasures within Russia, along with geopolitical shifts in Asia and disruptions relating to Israel's conflict in G aza, may lead to greater uncertainty that could cause additional adverse impacts on global supply chains and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nMore generally, several governments including the  U.S. have raised the possibility of policies to induce 're-shoring' of supply chains, less reliance on imported supplies,  and  greater  national  production.  Ex amples  include  potential  'Buy America'  requirements  in  the  U.S.  If  such  steps  triggered  retaliation  in  other  markets restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their government-owned healthcare systems, the result could be a significant impact on Medtronic.\n\nOther significant changes or disruptions to international trade arrangements, such as termination or modifications of other existing trade agreements, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries. In light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nFinally, changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues, expenses, and cash flows. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company's operating results. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes.\n\n## Market disruptions resulting in diminished liquidity, or healthcare professional and staff strikes or other work stoppages, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operation, or financial condition.\n\nDisruptions  in  international  markets  and  supporting  financial  services  and  uncertainty  about  economic  conditions  (for  instance,  resulting  from  credit  scarcity, geopolitical risks and sovereign debt deterioration), have in the past caused periods of tightened credit availability and increased volatility in liquidity and borrowing terms. If these conditions were to recur or worsen, we may experience reduced demand for a number of our products. We also could experience reduced sales and profits due to delayed payments or the insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers, suppliers and vendors who experience liquidity issues, including as a result of cybersecurity incidents impacting private and government health insurance payors. In addition, healthcare professional and staff strikes or other work stoppages have in the past and may in the future cause reduced demand for our products. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n## Consolidation in the healthcare industry and the growing prevalence of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\n\nMany healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances.  As  the  healthcare  industry  consolidates,  competition  to  provide  goods  and  services  to  industry  participants  will  become  more  intense.  Further,  this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which can be used to negotiate price concessions. In addition, the movement of procedures to ASCs could also create downward pricing pressure. If we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or ASC procedures, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation or ASC procedures, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n## Healthcare industry cost-containment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components.\n\nMost of our customers, and the healthcare providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payors, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors. If third-party payor payment approval cannot be obtained by patients, sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components. The costcontainment measures that healthcare providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals, and GPOs and IDNs have also",

      "question": "What is the combined 2024 net sales contribution from the 'Rest of World' region for both Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Medtronic (MDT), and how does this reflect their respective geographic revenue strategies in the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "The combined 2024 net sales contribution from the 'Rest of World' region for Gilead Sciences and Medtronic is $19,215 million. Gilead Sciences generated $3,526 million in total revenues from the Rest of World region, while Medtronic reported $15,689 million in net sales from the same region. This indicates that Medtronic has a significantly larger revenue footprint than Gilead in non-U.S. and non-European markets, suggesting differing geographic expansion or market penetration strategies within the healthcare sector.",

      "question": "Considering Abbott's exposure to data privacy and security regulations and Eli Lilly's reliance on third-party providers for critical operations, how might evolving global data protection laws like the EU Artificial Intelligence Act increase compliance costs or operational risks for both companies, particularly in relation to Lilly's use of China-based suppliers and Abbott's acquisition-related intangible assets?",
      "answer": "Evolving global data protection laws like the EU Artificial Intelligence Act could increase compliance costs and operational risks for both Abbott and Eli Lilly due to their exposure to data privacy and security risks. Abbott's 2024 10-K highlights that it operates in a highly regulated environment and expects continued debate over data privacy and security regulations, which could adversely affect its business. This regulatory uncertainty could impact Abbott's $305 million in non-deductible developed technology intangible assets from the CSI acquisition, as additional compliance requirements could reduce the value or utility of these assets. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's 2024 10-K emphasizes that its use of third-party providers, including China-based suppliers, exposes it to data privacy and security risks, especially in light of potential U.S. legislative actions like the BIOSECURE Act. If Lilly must restructure its supply chain or invest in new compliance measures, it could face increased operational costs and delays in product approvals. Both companies may need to allocate significant resources to adjust business practices to comply with evolving laws such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, directly affecting their financial performance and strategic investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott's 10-K notes that it operates in a highly regulated environment and expects continued debate over data privacy and security regulations, which could adversely affect its business. Specifically, it reports $305 million in non-deductible developed technology intangible assets from the CSI acquisition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Eli Lilly's 10-K highlights that its use of third-party providers, including China-based suppliers, exposes it to data privacy, security, and regulatory risks, particularly in light of potential U.S. legislative actions like the BIOSECURE Act and global laws such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face increased compliance costs and operational risks due to evolving global data protection laws. Abbott\u2019s developed technology intangible assets could lose value if new regulations require costly modifications, while Lilly\u2019s reliance on third-party providers\u2014especially in China\u2014could lead to supply chain disruptions or increased compliance costs under stricter data privacy laws."

The goodwill is identifiable to the Medical Devices reportable segment and is attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Revenues and earnings of CSI included in Abbott's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to Abbott's consolidated revenue and earnings.\n\n## Legislative Issues\n\nAbbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn  November 2023, the  FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ,  which  ex pands  the breadth and frequency of required segment disclosures. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2024. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements, but required additional disclosures as included in Note 16 - Segment and Geographic Area Information.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n\n- In  November  2024,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2024-03, Income  Statement  (Subtopic  220-40):  Reporting  Comprehensive  Income  -  Expense  Disaggregation Disclosures , which requires an entity to disclose on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about specific income statement expense categories. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively.  The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2027 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires an entity to disclose annually additional information related to the company's income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid during the period. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2025 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 - A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nUnder the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.",

The foregoing risks may be heightened in jurisdictions outside the U.S., where we may have fewer alternativ e prov iders as well as face additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. Among other third-party prov iders, we, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, depend on China-based suppliers for portions of our supply chain. U.S. officials are increasingly considering legislation or other actions that are intended to limit supply chain reliance on China, including the BIOSECURE Act. In February 2025, the U.S. presidential administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded with tariffs on select U.S. goods. If enacted, additional measures could result in supply disruptions or delays, increase costs more significantly, or inv ite further retaliatory measures, any of which could negativ ely impact our business. See, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Doing Business Internationally-Unev en economic growth or downturns or international trade and other global disruptions, geopolitical tensions, or disputes could adv ersely affect our business and operating results\" for additional information. In some cases, product or indication approv als depend on the outcome of regulatory inspections of third parties on which we rely. Third-party inspection outcomes hav e and may in the future delay or prev ent product launches and otherwise negativ ely affect our business. Failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, priv acy, security, or other obligations to us, our clinical trial subjects, and our patients could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business and could also result in non-compliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or subject us to reputational harm.\n\n## \u00b7 Our use of artificial intelligence (AI) or other emerging technologies could adversely impact our business and financial results.\n\nWe deploy AI and other emerging technologies in v arious facets of our operations and we continue to explore further use cases for AI. The rapid advancement of these technologies presents opportunities for us in research, manufacturing, commercialization, and other business endeav ors but also entails risks, including that AI-generated content, analyses, or recommendations we utilize could be deficient, or that our competitors may more quickly or effectiv ely adopt AI capabilities. Our use of AI or other emerging technologies could also exacerbate regulatory, cybersecurity and other significant risks.\n\nEffectiv e dev elopment, management, and use of AI technologies is nov el and complex, and there are technical challenges associated with achiev ing desired lev els of accuracy, efficiency, and reliability. The algorithms and models utilized in AI systems may hav e limitations, including biases, errors, or inability to handle certain data types or scenarios or to render explainable outputs. Furthermore, there are risks associated with the fact that the platforms prov iding AI models are in many cases owned and operated by emerging companies with less contractual and compliance sophistication. These factors may undermine our ability to effectiv ely utilize AI or create competitiv e disadv antages should our competitors more skillfully make use of AI capabilities. Further, if we are unable to effectiv ely manage the use of AI technologies by our employees, our confidential information, intellectual property, or reputation could be put at risk.\n\nThe emergence of AI and other technologies may exacerbate other risks, including those related to regulation, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, confidentiality, and data priv acy or security. For example, regulatory uncertainty related to AI or other emerging technologies may require significant resources to adjust business practices to comply with dev eloping laws. Sev eral gov ernmental authorities hav e already proposed or enacted laws and other guidance gov erning AI, such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. These and other dev eloping obligations may prev ent or make it harder for us to conduct or enhance our business using AI, or lead to regulatory fines, penalties, or other liability. Further, use of AI technologies could lead to unintended consequences, such as data leakage, healthcare fraud and abuse, cybersecurity incidents, intellectual property infringement, or unintended biases.\n\n## Risks Related to Doing Business Internationally\n\n- Uneven economic growth or downturns or international trade and other global disruptions, geopolitical tensions, or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results.",

These disruptions could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations, particularly for its medical devices and diagnostics products. Similarly, Eli Lilly experienced supply constraints for its incretin medicines, such as tirzepatide, where demand exceeded production at times in 2024. Although Lilly has expanded internal and contracted manufacturing capacity, delays or challenges in operationalizing this capacity could limit its ability to meet demand in new markets.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn  addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\n\n## Business and Operational Risks\n\n## Disruptions to Abbott's global supply chain, which is large and complex, could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.\n\nAbbott's operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain. While Abbott has taken and will continue to take actions to mitigate the risks of disruptions to its global supply chain, disruptions to it could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages contributed to global supply chain challenges in the early part of the decade, which adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services.\n\n## Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\n\nFrom time to time, Abbott pursues acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or may dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and  investments  than  originally  anticipated.  Abbott  may  not  be  able  to  integrate  acquisitions  successfully  into  its  ex isting  business  or  transition  disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-lived assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.\n\n## Abbott depends on sophisticated information systems and maintains protected personal data, and a significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption affecting these information systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSimilar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products make them susceptible to a cybersecurity incident, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cybersecurity incidents. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott's information systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product availability, functionality or safety, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.\n\nAbbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to numerous data privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, including data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in 'Regulation' under Item 1, 'Business.' A breach or unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and ex penses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.",

These disruptions and challenges could result from actual or perceiv ed quality, ov ersight, or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters (including increased instances or sev erity of natural disasters or other ev ents that may be due to climate change), public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics; periods of unev en economic growth or downturns; emergence or escalation of, and responses to international tension and conflicts; equipment, mechanical, data, or IT system v ulnerabilities, such as system inadequacies, inadequate controls or procedures, operating failures, unauthorized access, serv ice interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, theft, exfiltration, ransomware or other cyberattacks from a v ariety of sources; labor shortages; challenges and complexities in manufacturing new drug modalities; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; v ertical integration by competitors within our supply chain; or inability to obtain single-source or other raw or intermediate materials. Regional or single source dependencies may in some cases accentuate risks related to manufacturing and supply. For example, we, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, depend on China-based suppliers for portions of our supply chain, including integral chemical synthesis, reagents, starting materials, and ingredients. Finding alternativ e suppliers if and as necessary due to geopolitical dev elopments or otherwise may not be feasible or could take a significant amount of time and inv olv e significant expense due to the nature of our products and the need to obtain regulatory approv als which would cause disruptions to patients and detrimentally impact our business. See, Item 1A, \"Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Operations-Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adv ersely affect our business,\" and \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Doing Business Internationally-Unev en economic growth or downturns or international trade and other global disruptions, geopolitical tensions, or disputes could adv ersely affect our business and operating results\" for more details. Supply and channel dynamics in some cases also contribute to v ariability in financial results for our products from period to period.\n\nDifficulties in predicting or v ariability in demand and supply for our products and those of our competitors and the v ery long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity hav e resulted, and in the future may result, in difficulty meeting demand, or disruptions, shortages, and higher costs in the supply of, our products. For example, at v arious times during 2024 demand for our incretin medicines exceeded production. While tirzepatide supply currently exceeds demand in the U.S., demand remains dynamic and could be impacted by a v ariety of factors. Supply considerations will continue to influence the timing and approach (including av ailable presentations) of tirzepatide launches in new markets. Despite our ongoing efforts to meet projected future demand by obtaining additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity, there can be no assurances that such capacity increases that we expect will be needed to meet future demand will be realized as expected or that we will meet demand in launched markets in the future. Delays or challenges in operationalizing additional manufacturing capacity could limit our ability to capitalize on demand for our products. Conv ersely, unexpected ev ents that limit demand for our products or anticipated demand for product candidates would undermine our ability to realize the full benefit of significant capital expenditures that we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, to augment manufacturing capacity, may render built or in process manufacturing capacity unnecessary, and may also subject us to contractual payment obligations, which may be significant. The foregoing risks and uncertainties could negativ ely impact our consolidated results of operations and reputation. See Item 1, \"Business-Raw Materials and Product Supply\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Financial Condition and Liquidity,\" for more details.\n\n## \u00b7 Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely on third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances, and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party serv ice prov iders, for selected aspects of product and clinical dev elopment, manufacturing, commercialization, hosting of, and support for, IT systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. As examples, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations, certain activ e ingredient manufacturing, finishing operations, and dev ice or component production and assembly to contract manufacturing organizations, and the distribution of our products through logistics prov iders. To support anticipated demand for our current and prospectiv e products, we hav e expanded relationships with contract manufacturing organizations and other third parties in recent periods.",

      "answer": "LLY discontinued its Performance Award (PA) program in 2024, which had previously issued approximately 0.4 million shares in 2024, 0.5 million in 2023, and 0.7 million in 2022. These awards were tied to pre-established earnings-per-share targets over a two-year period. With the program now discontinued and no remaining unrecognized compensation cost, LLY has shifted focus to its Relative Value Award (RVA) program. RVAs are payable in shares and depend on the growth of LLY's stock price over a three-year period relative to its peers. The weighted-average fair value of RVA units granted in 2024 was $1,106.40, significantly higher than in previous years, indicating a strategic emphasis on market-based incentives. This shift reflects a move from performance-based earnings metrics to market-relative performance to better align executive incentives with long-term shareholder value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From LLY's 2024 10-K, we learn that the Performance Award (PA) program was discontinued as of December 31, 2024, with no remaining compensation cost. In 2024, 0.4 million PA shares were issued.",
        "Step 2: The PA program was tied to earnings-per-share targets over a two-year period, with fair values of $335.86 and $234.93 in 2023 and 2022, respectively.",
        "Step 3: LLY continues to use the Relative Value Award (RVA) program, which measures stock price growth relative to peers over a three-year period. The fair value of RVA units granted in 2024 was $1,106.40, showing increased emphasis on this program.",
        "Step 4: The transition from PAs to RVAs indicates a strategic shift from earnings-based incentives to market-relative performance metrics to better align executive compensation with long-term value creation."

Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure.\n\n## Medical Devices\n\nThese  products  include  a  broad  line  of  rhythm  management,  electrophysiology,  heart  failure,  vascular  and  structural  heart  devices  for  the  treatment  of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care and continuous glucose monitoring products, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders.

      "answer": "The increasing regulatory environment affects both Danaher and Merck in distinct but significant ways. For Danaher, the filings explicitly state that increasing regulation is a key challenge that requires the company to invest significantly\u2014both organically and through acquisitions\u2014to address the demands of a more regulated global environment. This includes improving operational efficiency and quality while expanding into high-growth markets and segments. These regulatory pressures contribute to a 10.5% decrease in consolidated revenues in 2023, partly due to declining demand for certain products and the broader impact of regulatory compliance costs. For Merck, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) directly affects its financial outlook by introducing government price-setting for certain Medicare drugs starting in 2026, including Januvia, and potentially Keytruda in 2028. The IRA also increases Medicaid rebate exposure beyond the previous 100% cap on Average Manufacturer Price (AMP), which could result in rebates exceeding sales revenue for certain drugs. These regulatory pressures create specific financial and strategic challenges: Danaher must manage declining revenues while investing heavily in innovation and global operations, and Merck faces potential revenue compression and increased uncertainty in drug pricing and approval timelines.",

      "answer": "DHR classifies gains or losses related to its net investment hedges as foreign currency translation adjustments in the schedule of changes in OCI, as stated in Note 19. These adjustments are attributable to its hedges of its net investment in foreign operations. MRK also records unrealized gains or losses on its net investment hedges in the foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI, and these remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCL) until the sale or substantial liquidation of the subsidiary. Additionally, MRK uses euro-denominated debt as an economic hedge of its net investment in foreign operations, with foreign currency transaction gains or losses included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From DHR's 10-K filing, it is stated that gains or losses related to net investment hedges are classified as foreign currency translation adjustments in OCI (Note 19).",
        "Step 2: From MRK's 10-K filing, it is stated that unrealized gains or losses on forward contracts designated as net investment hedges are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI and remain in AOCL until the subsidiary is sold or liquidated.",
        "Step 3: MRK also uses euro-denominated debt as an economic hedge, with foreign currency transaction gains or losses included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize that both companies use foreign currency translation adjustments within OCI to classify the financial impact of net investment hedges, but differ in the instruments used (e.g., derivative contracts vs. foreign currency debt)."

      "question": "How does the risk of supplier bankruptcy specifically affect Amgen's Puerto Rico manufacturing operations and Thermo Fisher's supply chain, considering Amgen's reliance on sole-source suppliers like the SureClick autoinjector provider and Thermo Fisher's $44.02 billion in recorded goodwill as of December 31, 2023?",
      "answer": "The risk of supplier bankruptcy poses a direct threat to Amgen's manufacturing capabilities, particularly in Puerto Rico, where natural disasters and grid instability have already stressed operations. Amgen relies on sole-source suppliers, such as the provider of SureClick autoinjectors, which are critical for drug delivery systems of key products like Repatha and ENBREL. If one of these suppliers were to go bankrupt, Amgen may face delays or disruptions in obtaining these components, which are specifically cited in regulatory filings and cannot be quickly replaced without approval, potentially affecting product supply and sales. For Thermo Fisher, supplier bankruptcy could disrupt the flow of materials essential to its operations, especially given its reliance on sole or limited suppliers for reasons of quality or regulatory compliance. With $44.02 billion in recorded goodwill as of December 31, 2023, any supply chain disruption that affects earnings or operational performance could impair the realizability of that goodwill, leading to material financial charges and negatively impacting financial results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen relies on sole-source suppliers such as the provider of SureClick autoinjectors, which are critical for key drug delivery systems, and operates a major manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico that has faced repeated disruptions due to natural disasters and grid instability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Thermo Fisher has $44.02 billion in recorded goodwill as of December 31, 2023, and relies on sole or limited suppliers for certain materials, where supplier bankruptcy could disrupt production and negatively impact earnings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A supplier bankruptcy would directly threaten Amgen\u2019s ability to manufacture and supply its products, especially due to regulatory constraints on switching suppliers. For Thermo Fisher, such a disruption could jeopardize the performance of acquired businesses, thereby threatening the realizability of its significant goodwill and leading to impairment charges."

      "question": "How does the impact of geopolitical conflicts on TMO's international operations potentially affect Amgen's clinical trial timelines and associated costs, given their partnership and reliance on global trial sites?",
      "answer": "TMO's 2023 10-K reports that geopolitical conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Middle East, have disrupted clinical trial timing and execution, which could delay regulatory approvals and increase development costs for companies like Amgen that rely on global trial sites. Amgen specifically notes that disruptions from geopolitical conflicts could delay or prevent marketing approvals for their product candidates. Since Amgen partners with pharmaceutical companies and relies on international clinical trial sites in countries like China, India, and South America, any geopolitical instability affecting TMO's operations could indirectly impact Amgen\u2019s ability to conduct timely and cost-effective trials, thereby increasing development costs and delaying product commercialization.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen conducts clinical trials internationally, including in regions like China, India, and South America, and notes that geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Ukraine, Middle East) have previously disrupted clinical trials, increasing costs and delaying regulatory approvals.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - TMO reports that geopolitical conflicts and regional instabilities have disrupted global operations, including supply chains and logistics, which could affect the availability of clinical trial materials or infrastructure.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since Amgen partners with other pharmaceutical companies (like TMO) and relies on global clinical trial sites, disruptions affecting TMO\u2019s international operations (e.g., supply chain, logistics, site access) could directly impact Amgen\u2019s ability to conduct timely trials, increasing costs and delaying regulatory submissions."

      "answer": "Amgen faces financial risks due to its reliance on third-party collaborations for pharmaceutical development, where failures by partners to meet obligations could delay or prevent product development and sales, potentially leading to increased costs and lost revenue opportunities. Thermo Fisher faces a $0.02 billion revenue reduction in 2023 due to unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, which directly impacts reported profitability and cash flows. These represent different financial challenges: Amgen's risks are tied to operational dependencies and potential development delays, while Thermo Fisher's are tied to external macroeconomic factors affecting revenue and financial results.",

        "Step 1: Extract from AMGN evidence - Amgen depends on third-party collaborations for pharmaceutical development, and partner failures could delay development, increase costs, and affect sales.",

          "chunk_text": "## Arcellx\n\nIn January 2023, we closed an agreement to enter into a global strategic collaboration with Arcellx, a public company, to co-develop and co-commercialize Arcellx's lead late-stage product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and potential future nextgeneration  autologous  and  non-autologous  products.  In  December  2023,  we  amended  the  agreement  and  expanded  the  scope  of  the  collaboration  to  include lymphomas and exercised our option to negotiate a license for Arcellx's ARC-SparX program, ACLX-001, in multiple myeloma. In conjunction with the collaboration, we recorded a combined $313 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2023, primarily related to upfront payments. We also recorded a combined equity investment of $299 million. Our equity investment is subject to lock-up provisions until June 2025 and is included in Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024. The companies will share development, clinical  trial  and  commercialization  costs  for  CART-ddBCMA  and  will  jointly  commercialize  the  product  and  split  U.S.  profits 50/50.  Outside  the  U.S.,  we  will commercialize  the  product  and Arcellx  will  receive  royalties  on  sales.  Under  the  agreement, Arcellx   is  eligible  to  receive  performance-based  development  and regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.5 billion related to CART-ddBCMA, a potential future next-generation autologous product and a potential future nonautologous product, with further commercial milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote the future products. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid $68 million for development milestones met, which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If additional future products are developed, Arcellx would be eligible to receive additional milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote these additional future products as well.\n\n## Dragonfly\n\nIn April  2022,  we  entered  into  a  strategic  research  collaboration  agreement  (the  'Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement')  with  Dragonfly  Therapeutics,  Inc. ('Dragonfly') to develop natural killer ('NK') cell engager-based immunotherapies for oncology and inflammation indications. Under the terms of the Dragonfly Collaboration Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide license from Dragonfly for the 5T4-targeting investigational immunotherapy program, DF7001, as well as  options,  after  the  completion  of  certain  preclinical  activities,  to  license  ex clusive,  worldwide  rights  to  develop  and  commercialize  additional  NK  cell  engager programs using the  Dragonfly  Tri-specific  NK  Engager  platform.  Upon  the  closing  of  the  Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement,  we  made  a  $300  million  upfront payment to Dragonfly, and we made an additional $15 million payment related to a target selection in connection with an August 2022 amendment to the agreement, which were recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. In July 2023, we mutually agreed to terminate the DF7001 program. If we exercise our options on additional NK cell engager programs, Dragonfly would be eligible to receive opt-in payments and performance-based development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on worldwide net sales on these optioned programs.\n\n## Merck\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. ('Merck') to jointly develop  and  commercialize  long-acting  investigational  treatments  in  HIV   that  combine  G ilead's  investigational  capsid  inhibitor,  lenacapavir,  and  Merck's investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. The collaboration is initially focused on long-acting oral and injectable formulations.\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  as  amended,  G ilead  and  Merck  will  mostly  share  global  development  and  commercialization  costs  at 60%  and 40%, respectively, across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, if approved, G ilead would lead commercialization in the U.S., and Merck would lead  commercialization  in  the  European  Union  ('EU')  and  rest  of  the  world.  For  long-acting  injectable  products,  if  approved,  Merck  would  lead commercialization in the U.S. and G ilead would lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world. Under the terms of the agreement, G ilead and Merck would jointly promote the combination products in the U.S. and certain other major markets. If successful, we would share global product revenues with Merck equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-determined per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion in net product sales for the oral combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue would increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Upon passing $3.5 billion in net product sales for the injectable combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue will increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Reimbursements of R&amp;D costs to or from Merck are recorded within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenses recognized under the agreement were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. No revenues have been recognized under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

      "question": "Given that both Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead have partnered with Dragonfly Therapeutics in the immunotherapy space, how do their financial commitments and partnership models differ based on the disclosed terms?",
      "answer": "Gilead entered into a strategic research collaboration with Dragonfly Therapeutics that included a $300 million upfront payment and an additional $15 million payment related to a target selection. The collaboration also included potential future opt-in payments, milestone payments, and royalties on worldwide net sales for additional NK cell engager programs. In contrast, Bristol-Myers Squibb only references Dragonfly in a glossary definition related to a specific lymphoma indication without any disclosed financial commitments or partnership terms. This suggests that while Gilead made significant financial commitments tied to performance milestones and future development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s relationship with Dragonfly appears to be non-financial or tangential based on the available disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Bristol-Myers Squibb mentions Dragonfly Therapeutics only in a glossary definition related to 'dif fuse large B-cell lymphoma' with no financial or partnership details provided.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Gilead entered into a collaboration with Dragonfly involving a $300 million upfront payment, a $15 million target selection payment, and potential future opt-in payments, milestone payments, and royalties on sales.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The comparison reveals a stark contrast: Gilead has a clearly defined financial and developmental partnership with Dragonfly, while BMY\u2019s reference is purely definitional and lacks any financial or strategic detail."

In  December  2023,  we  amended  the  agreement  and  expanded  the  scope  of  the  collaboration  to  include lymphomas and exercised our option to negotiate a license for Arcellx's ARC-SparX program, ACLX-001, in multiple myeloma. In conjunction with the collaboration, we recorded a combined $313 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2023, primarily related to upfront payments. We also recorded a combined equity investment of $299 million. Our equity investment is subject to lock-up provisions until June 2025 and is included in Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024. The companies will share development, clinical  trial  and  commercialization  costs  for  CART-ddBCMA  and  will  jointly  commercialize  the  product  and  split  U.S.  profits 50/50.  Outside  the  U.S.,  we  will commercialize  the  product  and Arcellx  will  receive  royalties  on  sales.  Under  the  agreement, Arcellx   is  eligible  to  receive  performance-based  development  and regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.5 billion related to CART-ddBCMA, a potential future next-generation autologous product and a potential future nonautologous product, with further commercial milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote the future products. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid $68 million for development milestones met, which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If additional future products are developed, Arcellx would be eligible to receive additional milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote these additional future products as well.\n\n## Dragonfly\n\nIn April  2022,  we  entered  into  a  strategic  research  collaboration  agreement  (the  'Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement')  with  Dragonfly  Therapeutics,  Inc. ('Dragonfly') to develop natural killer ('NK') cell engager-based immunotherapies for oncology and inflammation indications. Under the terms of the Dragonfly Collaboration Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide license from Dragonfly for the 5T4-targeting investigational immunotherapy program, DF7001, as well as  options,  after  the  completion  of  certain  preclinical  activities,  to  license  ex clusive,  worldwide  rights  to  develop  and  commercialize  additional  NK  cell  engager programs using the  Dragonfly  Tri-specific  NK  Engager  platform.  Upon  the  closing  of  the  Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement,  we  made  a  $300  million  upfront payment to Dragonfly, and we made an additional $15 million payment related to a target selection in connection with an August 2022 amendment to the agreement, which were recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. In July 2023, we mutually agreed to terminate the DF7001 program. If we exercise our options on additional NK cell engager programs, Dragonfly would be eligible to receive opt-in payments and performance-based development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on worldwide net sales on these optioned programs.\n\n## Merck\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. ('Merck') to jointly develop  and  commercialize  long-acting  investigational  treatments  in  HIV   that  combine  G ilead's  investigational  capsid  inhibitor,  lenacapavir,  and  Merck's investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. The collaboration is initially focused on long-acting oral and injectable formulations.\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  as  amended,  G ilead  and  Merck  will  mostly  share  global  development  and  commercialization  costs  at 60%  and 40%, respectively, across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, if approved, G ilead would lead commercialization in the U.S., and Merck would lead  commercialization  in  the  European  Union  ('EU')  and  rest  of  the  world.  For  long-acting  injectable  products,  if  approved,  Merck  would  lead commercialization in the U.S. and G ilead would lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world. Under the terms of the agreement, G ilead and Merck would jointly promote the combination products in the U.S. and certain other major markets. If successful, we would share global product revenues with Merck equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-determined per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion in net product sales for the oral combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue would increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Upon passing $3.5 billion in net product sales for the injectable combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue will increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Reimbursements of R&amp;D costs to or from Merck are recorded within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenses recognized under the agreement were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. No revenues have been recognized under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "In contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. G eneric versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after RDP expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. In general, EU law treats chemically synthesized drugs and biologically derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity.\n\n## Japan\n\nIn Japan, patents on pharmaceutical products are enforceable and may be extended for up to five years to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded eight years of regulatory exclusivity for approved indications and dosage. This regulatory exclusivity could be extended if certain pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. G eneric copies can receive regulatory approval after regulatory exclusivity and patent expirations.\n\nIn general, Japanese law treats chemically synthesized and biologically derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity.\n\n## Rest of the World\n\nIn  countries  outside  of  the  U.S.,  the  EU  and  Japan,  there  are  a  variety  of  legal  systems  with  respect  to  intellectual  property  and  regulatory  ex clusivity  of pharmaceuticals. Most other developed countries utilize systems similar to either the U.S. or the EU. Among developing countries, some have adopted patent laws and/or regulatory exclusivity laws, while others have not. Some developing countries have formally adopted laws in order to comply with WTO commitments, but have not taken steps to implement these laws in a meaningful way. Enforcement of WTO actions is a long process between governments, and there is no assurance of the outcome. Thus, in assessing the likely future market exclusivity of our innovative drugs in developing countries, we take into account not only formal legal rights but political and other factors as well.\n\nThe following chart shows our key products together with the year in which the earliest basic exclusivity loss (patent rights or regulatory exclusivity) is currently estimated to occur in the U.S., the EU and Japan (the 'estimated minimum market exclusivity date'). We also sell our pharmaceutical products in other countries; however, data is not provided on a country-by-country basis because individual country revenues are not significant outside the U.S., the EU and Japan. G enerally, the estimated minimum market exclusivity date in the table below pertains to the end of regulatory exclusivity or the  COM patent expiration for the respective products and PTR if granted. In situations where there is only regulatory exclusivity without patent protection, a competitor could seek regulatory approval by submitting its own clinical study data to obtain marketing approval prior to the ex piration of regulatory ex clusivity.",

Substantial difficulties, costs and delays could result from integrating our acquisitions, including for: (i) R&amp;D, manufacturing, distribution, sales, marketing, promotion and information technology activities; (ii) policies, procedures, processes, controls and compliance; and (iii) tax considerations.\n\nWhere we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities, such as in connection with a joint venture or acquisition, the value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate in value. W e may not control the company in which we acquire securities, such as in connection with a collaborative arrangement, and as a result, we will have limited ability to determine its management, operational decisions, internal controls and compliance and other policies, which can result in additional financial and reputational risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Our divestitures also may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial  arrangements,  continued  supply  and  services  arrangements,  or  potential  litigation,  following  the  transaction.  Under  these  arrangements, nonperformance by us could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition or reputation.\n\nWe might also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings. The value allocated to certain of our assets could be substantially impaired due to a number of factors beyond our control. New or revised accounting standards, rules and interpretations could result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\nIf the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Moreover, due to the substantial amount of debt that we incurred to finance the cash portion of the Celgene,  MyoKardia,  Mirati,  Karuna  and  RayzeBio  acquisitions,  there  can  be  no  assurance  of  when  we  will  be  able  to  expand  our  business  development capacity.

W e are facing increasing competition for a limited pool of qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, government entities, research institutions, companies seeking to enter the healthcare space, and companies in other industries.  Additionally, we periodically adjust our personnel needs in response to changing macroeconomic conditions, market opportunities, management changes, acquisitions, cost levels and other internal and external considerations, which may adversely impact our workplace culture and ability to retain and incentivize employees. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain quality talent or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.\n\n## Market, Liquidity and Credit Risks\n\n## We have significant indebtedness that could have negative consequences .\n\nOur acquisitions of Celgene, MyoKardia, Mirati, Karuna and RayzeBio increased the amount of our debt resulting in additional interest expense, and we may incur more debt to finance future acquisitions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide material information around events and uncertainties known to management that are relevant to an assessment of the financial condition and results of operations of  G ilead and should therefore be read in conjunction with our audited  Consolidated  Financial Statements and the related notes thereto and other disclosures included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors). Additional information related to the comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources between the years 2023 and 2022 is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K filed with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n## Management Overview\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc. (including its consolidated subsidiaries, referred to as 'G ilead,' the 'company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') is a biopharmaceutical company that has pursued and achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people. We are committed to advancing innovative medicines to prevent and treat life-threatening diseases, including HIV , viral hepatitis, coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19'), cancer and inflammation. We operate in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California.\n\nOur strategic ambitions are to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030 (tracking since 2020); (ii) be a biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii)  deliver  shareholder  value  in  a  sustainable  and  responsible  manner.  Our  strategic  priorities  to  deliver  on  these  ambitions  include:  (i)  max imize  near-term revenue growth; (ii) maximize impact of long-acting HIV therapies; and (iii) ex pand and deliver on oncology programs.\n\n## Year in Review\n\nDuring 2024, we delivered growth in our HIV , Oncology and Liver Disease product sales and continued to invest in our business and research and development ('R&amp;D') pipeline through advancement of our portfolio and broadening of available therapies, including through acquisitions and collaborations. Meanwhile, we maintained our financial position through repayment of senior notes coming due and the issuance of new senior notes, and provided shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. The following represents a summary of notable business updates and events during 2024, including certain items from our press releases, which readers are encouraged to review in full as available on our website at www.gilead.com.

In the lenacapavir group, 99.9% of participants did not acquire HIV  infection, with two incident cases among 2,179 participants. Lenacapavir  reduced  HIV   infections  by  96%  compared  to  background  HIV   incidence  in  cisgender  men  and  gender-diverse  people,  and  additionally demonstrated superiority to daily Truvada (89% relative risk reduction). Lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated and no significant or new safety concerns were identified. The use of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV is investigational.\n\n## Oncology\n\n- Received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA to Trodelvy for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer ('ESSCLC') whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The use of Trodelvy in ES-SCLC is investigational.\n- Announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval of Trodelvy for use in pre-treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, following the results of the Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 trial announced in May 2024.\n- Incurred partial impairment charges related to in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') assets acquired by Gilead from Immunomedics, Inc. in 2020 as a result of our evaluation of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data and a strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer ('NSCLC') for Trodelvy in the second-line indication (see further information in 'Results of Operations; In-Process Research and Development Impairments' below).",

      "answer": "BMY invested $11.2 billion in R&D in 2024, with a strong emphasis on oncology and novel modalities such as cell therapies, ADCs, and radiopharmaceuticals. This includes a significant $12.1 billion outlay related to the acquisition of Karuna, highlighting BMY's strategy of acquiring and integrating innovative platforms to bolster its oncology pipeline. In contrast, GILD reported partial impairment charges on IPR&D assets acquired from Immunomedics, specifically related to the discontinuation of the Trodelvy clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC. This reflects a strategic pivot away from certain oncology indications after evaluating Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data. While BMY is doubling down on oncology through substantial investment and expansion of its cell therapy capabilities, GILD is selectively retreating from certain programs while still pursuing other oncology opportunities, such as the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Trodelvy in ES-SCLC.",

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development\n\nR&amp;D is critical to our long-term competitiveness. We concentrate our R&amp;D efforts in the following disease areas with significant unmet medical needs: oncology and hematology with novel modalities in cell therapies, protein degraders, ADCs and radiopharmaceuticals; immunology with a focus on establishing new standards of care in pulmonology, rapidly advancing cell therapy into immunology diseases and transformational programs to control inflammation, reset immune memory and promote homeostasis in dermatology and rheumatology disorders; cardiovascular diseases by leveraging deep expertise across thrombotic diseases, heart failures and  cardiomyopathies;  and  neuroscience  with  a  focus  on  developing  new  treatments  in  neuropsychiatry  and  neurodegeneration.  Our  R&amp;D  pipeline  includes potential  medicines in various modalities including small (chemically synthesized) molecules and large (protein) molecules-also known as biologics-and also degraders, T-cell, millamolecules, ADCs, and cell therapies. In addition to discovering and developing new molecular entities, we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new indications and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients.\n\nIn order for a new drug to reach the market, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S., the EU and most foreign countries provide for the determination of a drug's effectiveness and safety through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. The clinical development of a potential new drug typically includes Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical studies that have been designed specifically to support an application for regulatory approval for a particular indication, assuming the studies are successful.\n\nPhase I clinical studies involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety and proper dosing. Phase II clinical  studies  involve  a  larger  patient  population  to  investigate  side  effects,  efficacy  and  optimal  dosage  of  the  drug  candidate.  Phase  III  clinical  studies  are conducted to confirm Phase II results in a significantly larger patient population over a longer term and to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate. Although regulatory approval is typically based on the results of Phase III clinical studies, there are times when approval can be granted based on data from earlier studies.\n\nWe consider our registrational studies to be our significant  R&amp;D programs.  These programs may include both investigational compounds in  Phases  II and  III development for initial indications, or marketed products that are in development for additional indications or formulations.\n\nDrug development is time consuming, expensive and risky. The R&amp;D process (i.e., target identification to major market approval) typically takes about fifteen years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval. According to the KMR Group, based on industry success rates from 2019-2023, approximately 93% of small molecules that enter Phase I development fail to achieve regulatory approval. Small molecules that enter  Phase  II development have a failure rate of approximately 81% while approximately 33% of  Phase  III small molecules fail to achieve approval. For biologics, the failure rate is approx imately 89% from Phase I development, approximately 72% from Phase II development and approximately 23% from Phase III.\n\nR&amp;D expenses are comprised of the following main categories: (i) research, which includes costs to support the discovery and development of new molecular entities through  pre-clinical  studies;  (ii)  drug  development,  which  includes  costs  to  support  clinical  development  of  potential  new  products,  including  ex pansion  of indications for ex isting products through Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical studies and (iii) Other, which includes costs to support manufacturing development of pre-approved products, medical support of marketed products, IPRD impairment charges, acquisition-related charges and proportionate allocations of enterprisewide costs including facilities, information technology, and other appropriate costs. Acquired IPRD include upfront payments, contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or in-license arrangements of third-party intellectual property rights, as well as any upfront and contingent milestones payable by BMS to alliance partners prior to regulatory approval. Our R&amp;D expenses were $11.2 billion in 2024, $9.3 billion in 2023 and $9.5 billion in 2022. Acquired IPRD expenses were $13.4 billion in 2024, $913 million in 2023 and $815 million in 2022. Acquired IPRD expenses in 2024 included $12.1 billion related to the acquisition of Karuna, as further described in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements.\"\n\nWe manage our R&amp;D programs on a product portfolio basis, investing resources in each stage of R&amp;D from early discovery through late-stage development. We continually evaluate our portfolio of R&amp;D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support the future growth of the Company.\n\nOur drug discovery and development work takes place across a network of state-of-the-art facilities worldwide. We have continued our investment in our existing sites and the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities. For example, we opened an R&amp;D facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2023 and Hyderabad, India in 2024, and we are opening an R&amp;D facility in San Diego, California (planned for 2026). In addition, in support of a continued investment in our cell therapy portfolio, we  continue  expanding  our  manufacturing  capabilities  through  the  construction  of  new  state-of-the-art  cell  therapy  manufacturing  facilities  in  Devens, Massachusetts, which was completed in 2023, as well as in Leiden, Netherlands and Libertyville, Illinois which are currently ongoing.",

In the lenacapavir group, 99.9% of participants did not acquire HIV  infection, with two incident cases among 2,179 participants. Lenacapavir  reduced  HIV   infections  by  96%  compared  to  background  HIV   incidence  in  cisgender  men  and  gender-diverse  people,  and  additionally demonstrated superiority to daily Truvada (89% relative risk reduction). Lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated and no significant or new safety concerns were identified. The use of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV is investigational.\n\n## Oncology\n\n- Received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA to Trodelvy for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer ('ESSCLC') whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The use of Trodelvy in ES-SCLC is investigational.\n- Announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval of Trodelvy for use in pre-treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, following the results of the Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 trial announced in May 2024.\n- Incurred partial impairment charges related to in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') assets acquired by Gilead from Immunomedics, Inc. in 2020 as a result of our evaluation of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data and a strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer ('NSCLC') for Trodelvy in the second-line indication (see further information in 'Results of Operations; In-Process Research and Development Impairments' below).",

      "question": "What specific regulatory processes does Abbott's Diagnostics segment face under the FDA and IVDR that could impact its financial performance, and why does CVS Health highlight regulatory changes as a risk factor in its forward-looking statements?",
      "answer": "Abbott's Diagnostics segment faces multiple regulatory processes, including FDA classifications for diagnostic products (Class I, II, or III), with Class II requiring 510(k) submissions and Class III requiring Premarket Approval (PMA) or Biological License Application (BLA). Additionally, in the EU, the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), effective since May 2022, imposes additional premarket and post-market requirements, with compliance deadlines extended to December 2029 depending on device classification. These regulatory hurdles increase development costs and time-to-market, directly affecting revenue timelines and financial performance. CVS Health highlights regulatory changes as a risk factor in its forward-looking statements because evolving regulations\u2014such as those affecting drug approvals, reimbursement policies, or pharmacy benefit management\u2014could impact its operational strategies, including formulary design and pharmacy network management. Both companies are exposed to regulatory shifts, with Abbott facing direct product approval risks and CVS acknowledging potential downstream effects on its pharmacy and health services operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott's Diagnostics segment is subject to FDA classifications (Class I, II, III), with Class II requiring 510(k) submissions and Class III requiring PMA or BLA, and must comply with the IVDR in the EU, effective May 2022, with compliance deadlines extended to December 2029.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - CVS Health includes regulatory changes in its forward-looking statement risk factors, indicating that evolving regulations could materially affect its business, including pharmacy benefit management and health services operations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Abbott's regulatory burden directly affects its product development timelines and costs, which can influence the availability and pricing of diagnostic products. CVS, as a pharmacy benefits manager and health services provider, is indirectly affected by such regulatory shifts through changes in reimbursement, formulary design, and drug access policies, which it must account for in strategic planning."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II products typically require premarket notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDA's Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a Biological License Application (BLA).\n\nIn the European Union (EU), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category. Certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to declare conformity to the Directive. Other products only require a self-certification process. In 2017, the EU adopted the new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) which replaced the existing directive in the EU for in vitro diagnostic products and imposed additional premarket and post-market regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. In July 2024, the IVDR was amended to extend the transition timeline period for dates of compliance as long as December 2029, depending on the diagnostic device classification. The diagnostic device must meet additional specific conditions set out in the amended regulations. However, the amendment did not delay the date of application of the IVDR itself which took effect on May 26, 2022.\n\nIn the Medical Devices segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.\n\nSimilar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., medical devices are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbott's medical device products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process.\n\nIn the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR)  which  replaced  the  existing  directives  in  the  EU  for  medical  devices  and  imposes  additional  premarket  and  post-market  regulatory  requirements  on manufacturers of such products. The MDR applies to manufacturers as of May 26, 2021 with extended transition periods lasting as long as December 31, 2028 depending on the risk classification of the device in the regulation. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the MDR.\n\nSome products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions.\n\nAfter approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority.\n\nIn the Nutritional Products segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.\n\nIn the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA's confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products.\n\n## Areas of Focus\n\nIn 2025 and beyond, Abbott expects to focus on the following areas:\n\nEstablished Pharmaceuticals - Abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its",

      "answer": "The combined value of U.S. government securities held by ABT and CVS as of December 31, 2024, is $627 million ($441 million by ABT and $186 million by CVS). ABT values its U.S. government securities using a mix of quoted prices in active markets ($7 million), significant other observable inputs ($420 million), and measured at NAV ($14 million). CVS does not specify its valuation methods in this context but reports its U.S. government securities at $186 million as part of its broader debt securities portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract ABT's value of U.S. government securities as of December 31, 2024, which is $441 million, and its valuation breakdown: $7 million in quoted prices in active markets, $420 million in significant other observable inputs, and $14 million measured at NAV.",
        "Step 2: Extract CVS's value of U.S. government securities as of December 31, 2024, which is $186 million, as listed under debt securities.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the combined value: $441 million (ABT) + $186 million (CVS) = $627 million.",
        "Step 4: Compare valuation methods: ABT provides a detailed breakdown of valuation techniques, while CVS does not specify its method for U.S. government securities and only reports the aggregate value."

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## Risk Factors (continued)\n\nWe are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.\n\nThe manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices, and our pharma and clinical development services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or personal injury, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers.\n\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We have internal controls and compliance systems to protect the company against acts committed by employees, agents or businesses that we acquire that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, but these controls and systems may not be sufficient to prevent every such wrongful act. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies which we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.\n\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the U.S. and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not",

For example, effective May 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) overhauled data protection laws in the European Union. GDPR has imposed more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to GDPR, took effect in September 2020.\n\nMany of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data.\n\nHIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS administers its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our Optum businesses, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and material fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nBecause we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nTo support our business operations in the United States and other countries we own and lease real properties. Our various reportable segments use these facilities for their respective business purposes, and we believe these current facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are adequate for our anticipated future needs.\n\n## ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe information required by this Item 3 is incorporated herein by reference to the information set forth under the captions 'Legal Matters' and 'Governmental Investigations, Audits and Reviews' in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data'\n\n## ITEM 4.

The company performs qualitative assessments to identify impairments of these investments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $22 million and $28 million, respectively, and investments measured at NAV of $16 million and $0 million, respectively, which are included in other assets.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company's reporting units. The company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If the qualitative assessment results in a determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The company may bypass the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the goodwill impairment test. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (limited to the amount of goodwill). The company determined that no impairments existed in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows:\n\n",

As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company performs an annual impairment test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill. The estimates of the reporting unit fair values are calculated using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs as well as discount rates. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate group of peer companies whose securities are traded on an active market. The annual impairment test indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values as of the impairment testing date; therefore, no impairment was recognized.\n\nWe identified a critical audit matter related to the quantitative analysis performed for such reporting units because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This required increased auditor judgment and extent of effort, including involvement of fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to peer company selection and financial projections, which can be impacted by regulatory and macro-economic factors.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation, business, and market assumptions including the discount rate, financial forecasts, and peer group used by management to estimate the fair value of reporting units where a quantitative analysis was performed, included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's annual goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the determination of the fair value such as controls related to management's financial forecasts, as well as controls over the selection of discount rates, company specific risks, peer companies, and market multiples.\n- We evaluated management's ability to forecast and meet future revenue, medical cost trend, and operating costs by comparing:\n- Actual results to historical forecasts.\n- Forecasted information to: internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, industry and economic trends, and analyst reports of revenue and earnings expectations for the Company and its peers.\n- We evaluated the impact of changes in management's forecasts from the October 1, 2021 annual measurement date to December 31, 2021.\n- We evaluated management's selection of peer companies and market multiples.\n- With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of (1) the valuation methodologies, including testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, (2) the weighting of such valuation methodologies, and (3) discount rate and company specific risks by:\n- Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n- Developing a range of independent discount rate estimates and comparing to those selected by management.\n\n## /S/ DELOITTE &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 15, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

      "answer": "Thermo Fisher Scientific excluded PPD, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc., and PeproTech, Inc. from its internal control over financial reporting assessment, representing approximately 5% of total assets and 2% of total revenues. In contrast, UnitedHealth Group did not exclude any assets or revenues from its internal control assessment, as evidenced by its full compliance attestation under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Therefore, the difference in their approaches is quantified by the 5% and 2% exclusions by Thermo Fisher, while UnitedHealth maintained a fully inclusive assessment.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the two findings to compare the approaches to internal control assessment, noting that Thermo Fisher made exclusions while UnitedHealth did not."

Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nAs described in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded PPD, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded PPD, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. PPD, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management's assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 5% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,109 million.

In addition, some of our remote monitoring products and serv ices incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes. These systems, products and serv ices (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) are susceptible to being damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer v iruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance (including by employees), power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes, war, conflicts or other unforeseen ev ents, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recov ery planning may be ineffectiv e or inadequate. Certain attacks also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products hav e been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems prov ided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a v ulnerability in our products or serv ices, or security breaches of third-party suppliers we rely on to process, store or transmit electronic information, can result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems and data hav e been subject to computer v iruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adv ersely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. In addition, the rapid ev olution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. The attacks, breaches, misappropriations and other disruptions and damage described abov e hav e the ability to interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, result in disclosure of personal data, damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defectiv e products or serv ices, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under priv acy and other laws and increased costs for security and remediation, in each case resulting in an adv erse effect on our business and financial statements. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cov er us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches. In addition, any businesses that we acquire may further expose us to the risks set forth abov e.\n\nIn addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, ev olv ing legal and regulatory standards, ev olv ing customer expectations, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and serv ices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain, enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectiv ely address these requirements. Further, more of our employees work remotely now compared to before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposes us to greater cybersecurity and data priv acy risks.\n\nAny inability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data priv acy and security requirements and prev ent data breaches can result in adv erse regulatory and business consequences and litigation. As a global organization, we are subject to data priv acy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of hav ing access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitiv e data in the course of our business.

Significant judgment is required for determining the Company's tax liabilities, and the  Company's tax returns are routinely examined by various tax authorities.  The  Internal  Revenue  Service (IRS) is currently conducting examinations of the Company's tax returns for the years 2017 and 2018, including the one-time transition tax enacted under the T ax Cuts and Jobs A ct of 2017 (TCJA). If the IRS disagrees with the Company's transition tax position, it may result in a significant tax liability . The IRS is also currently conducting examinations of the Company's tax returns for the years 2021 and 2022. In addition, various state and foreign tax examinations are in progress. In connection with the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  Base  Erosion  and  Profit  Shifting  project,  companies  are  required  to  disclose  more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company believes that its accrual for tax  contingencies is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. In addition, the Company may be negatively affected by changes in tax laws, or new tax laws, affecting, for example, tax rates, and/or revised tax law interpretations in domestic or foreign jurisdictions, including, among others, any potential changes to the existing U.S. tax law by the Executive Branch and Congress, as well as any changes in tax law resulting from the implementation of the OECD's two-pillar solution to reform the international tax landscape.\n\nThe Company has taken the position, based on the opinions of tax counsel, that its distribution of Organon &amp; Co.

With respect to product liability , the Company selfinsures substantially all of its risk, as the availability of commercial insurance has become more restrictive. The Company has evaluated its risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, has no insurance for most product liabilities. The Company will continually assess the most efficient means to address its risk; however, there can be no guarantee that insurance coverage will be obtained or, if obtained, will be sufficient to fully  cov er product liabilities that may  arise.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring 2024, the Company contributed $8 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $37 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2025, the Company's cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are forecasted to be approximately $8 million and $35 million, respectiv ely. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan's funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.\n\n## Contractual and Other Obligations\n\nFor a description of the Company's debt and lease obligations, commitments, and litigation and contingencies, refer to Notes 9, 13, 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nRefer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which hav e been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. T he Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic env ironment and on v arious other assumptions that are believ ed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.\n\nThe Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAcquired Intangibles-The Company's business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, dev eloped technology and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The fair v alues of acquired intangibles are determined using information av ailable near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ('EBITDA'), rev enue, rev enue growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The Company engages third-party v aluation specialists who rev iew the Company's critical assumptions and calculations of the fair v alue of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions. In connection with the acquisitions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized aggregate goodwill of $305 million and intangible assets of $419 million. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.\n\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair v alue of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted EBITDA for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company's reporting units to calculate an estimated fair v alue of each reporting unit. In ev aluating the estimates deriv ed by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relev ance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had fiv e reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believ es the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The Company's annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2024 indicated that in all instances, the fair v alues of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying v alues and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair v alue ov er carrying v alue (expressed as a percentage of carrying v alue for the respectiv e reporting unit) for each of the Company's reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 70% to approximately 450%.

          "chunk_text": "\nThe interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) swap rate. The fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate are recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting fair value changes in the swap contracts. In January 2025, the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million related to its 5.00% notes due 2053. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company's investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the Company's medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest rates. Changes in medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the Company's fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. A  sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of M erck's investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively . A  one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively . The fair value of M erck's debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. The fair values of M erck's investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly , include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily IPR&amp;D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. A dditionally , estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts, rebates and returns, depreciable  and  amortizable  lives,  recoverability  of  inventories,  including  those  produced  in  preparation  for  product  launches,  amounts  recorded  for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. A pplication of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements.\n\n## Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\nTo determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, the Company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the Company determines that substantially all of the fair v alue of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. T o be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability  to create outputs.\n\nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair v alues with limited ex ceptions. The fair v alues of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition  date  based  on  expectations  and  assumptions  that  are  deemed  reasonable  by  management.  Given  the  considerable  judgment  involved  in determining fair values, the  Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. A ssets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A ccordingly , the Company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company's intended use of those assets. A ny excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to",

      "question": "How do the distinct regulatory vulnerabilities of GILD's pharmaceutical operations and UNH's government-contracted healthcare services under Anti-Kickback Laws create different financial and operational risks for each company, based on their respective disclosures?",
      "answer": "GILD faces financial and operational risks related to Anti-Kickback Laws through its pharmaceutical sales and rebate reporting practices, which could result in criminal and/or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and significant remediation measures. UNH, specifically through its Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses, faces risks related to compliance with Anti-Kickback Laws in its relationships with government agencies, which could limit its ability to pursue and perform certain types of engagements, thereby materially and adversely affecting its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GILD's filing reveals that violations of Anti-Kickback Laws could result in criminal and/or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and significant remediation measures.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UNH's filing indicates that its Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies face risks under Anti-Kickback Laws, GILD's risk stems from its pharmaceutical operations and rebate reporting practices, while UNH's risk arises from its government-contracted healthcare services, particularly through its Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses."

      "answer": "DHR faces risks where third-party intellectual property claims could force the company to redesign, re-engineer, or rebrand products at substantial cost, directly affecting its ability to maintain profitability and competitive advantage. Meanwhile, PFE's business model relies on identifying biosimilar opportunities, which often involve litigation due to potential infringement claims. These claims can delay product launches, increase costs, and result in significant royalty payments. Therefore, while both companies are impacted by third-party intellectual property claims, DHR's risk centers on internal product redesign costs, whereas PFE's exposure is tied to external litigation and market-entry delays in biosimilar development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from DHR's evidence - 'be required to redesign, re-engineer or rebrand our products at substantial cost' indicates a direct financial and operational impact due to third-party IP claims.",

Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage and adequately protect our intellectual property; our failure to detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights each can adversely impact our business and financial statements.\n\nThese risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information, intellectual property, technology and other assets comparable to the United States. The risks we encounter in such countries include but are not limited to the following:\n\n- Joint ventures that we participate in can include restrictions that could compromise our control over the intellectual property, technology and proprietary information of the joint venture;\n- As we expand our operations globally, increasing amounts of our data, intellectual property and technology is used and stored in countries outside the United States, and regulations in certain countries require data to be stored locally. These factors increase the risk that such data, intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised;\n- Certain of our products have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional and/or increased levels of counterfeiting in the future;\n- Governmental entities may adopt regulations or other requirements that give them rights to certain of our intellectual property, technology and/or proprietary information, such as through compulsory licensing or ownership restrictions or requirements;\n- In certain countries, we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property rights as we do in the U.S.;\n- Governmental regulations relating to state secrecy or other topics limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdictions; and\n- Risks, costs and challenges of operating in a particular jurisdiction can result in a decision to relocate or divert operations to a different jurisdiction, potentially at higher cost.\n\nAny of these risks can adversely impact our business and financial statements. Refer to '-International economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements' for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations.\n\n## Third-parties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\n\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties' intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others. Disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, be required to cease marketing, manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign, re-engineer or re-brand our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statements. Third-party intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations. When we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\n## The U.S. government has certain rights with respect to incremental production capacity and/or the intellectual property we have developed using government financing.\n\nCertain agencies of the U.S. government, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ('BARDA') within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, have agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity and/or the development of technology at certain of our businesses, and our businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future.",

Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. While we have accrued for worldwide legal liabilities, no guarantee exists that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued.\n\nFor additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in, see Note 16A .\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY:\n\n## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\n\nOur success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. For example, in May 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court voted to invalidate Article 40 of Brazil's Patent Law, which guaranteed a minimum 10-year patent term from patent grant, and to give retroactive effect to such decision. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term made by parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area.\n\nFurther, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governments could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing intellectual property related to our products. Discussions are ongoing at the WTO regarding the role of intellectual property in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. This includes a proposal that would release WTO members from their obligation under WTO-TRIPS to grant and enforce various types of intellectual property protection on health products and technology in relation to the prevention, containment or treatment of COVID-19. In May 2021 and again in November 2021, the Biden Administration called on countries to waive intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country, its enforcement practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country's intellectual property framework (e.g., laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license). In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are employing aggressive strategies, such as 'at risk' launches that challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents. We are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a competitors' patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1 . Further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third-party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\n\n## THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS\n\nA properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies, but the patent granting process is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful.\n\nPart of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In some circumstances we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a 'first-to-market' or early market position for our products.\n\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant royalty payments or damages.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n19",

      "answer": "DHR faces operational and financial risks related to regulatory compliance, particularly in obtaining FDA clearances for its medical devices. Failure to obtain these clearances could delay product launches, increase compliance costs, or result in restricted product use, all of which could reduce market acceptance and sales. Additionally, DHR incurs significant costs to ensure compliance with laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, and marketing practices. These risks are tied to its product development and regulatory approval processes, which are subject to inspection and potential enforcement actions by the FDA and other global regulators. For PFE, the financial and operational challenges under Fraud and Abuse Laws are primarily tied to its business arrangements with managed care organizations and payers. PFE must navigate increasing scrutiny of these arrangements, which could lead to restrictions on formulary placement, pricing pressure, and reduced access to branded products. These challenges are compounded by the fact that PFE\u2019s revenue is heavily concentrated in a few key products, such as Comirnaty, which accounted for 45% of total revenues in 2021. If PFE fails to maintain favorable formulary placement or faces restrictions due to regulatory interpretations of fraud and abuse laws, the financial impact could be significant. Thus, while both companies are subject to Fraud and Abuse Laws, DHR\u2019s exposure centers on regulatory clearance and compliance costs, whereas PFE\u2019s risk is tied to market access and payer dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DHR mentions the importance of obtaining FDA clearances (e.g., 510(k) clearance) and the financial and operational consequences of failure, including delays, increased costs, and restricted product use.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - DHR explicitly states that it is subject to laws regulating fraud and abuse, and ensuring compliance involves substantial costs.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - PFE highlights that its business arrangements with managed care organizations and payers are subject to government scrutiny under fraud and abuse laws, which could impact formulary placement and pricing.",
        "Step 4: Extract from source B - PFE notes that Comirnaty accounted for 45% of total revenues in 2021, making the company particularly vulnerable to any regulatory or payer-driven disruptions.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Both DHR and PFE are subject to Fraud and Abuse Laws, but their exposure manifests differently: DHR\u2019s risk is tied to regulatory clearance and compliance costs for its medical devices, while PFE\u2019s risk is tied to market access and payer dynamics for its pharmaceutical products, particularly those with high revenue concentration."

Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nCertain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of-abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. Please see 'Item 1. Business-Regulatory Matters' for more information. Failure to meet these requirements can adversely impact our business and financial statements in the applicable geographies.\n\nTo varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product's label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product's market acceptance. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in 'Item 1. Business-Regulatory Matters.'\n\nGovernment authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of laws or regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal penalties, consent decrees, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, pre-market notification rescissions and other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled 'Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.' Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired. Ensuring that our operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs.\n\n## Our products can be subject to human clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nAs a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator's or the market's perception of these clinical data, can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements.",

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in the Forward-Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results section in this Form 10-K.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS:\n\n## MANAGED CARE TRENDS\n\nPrivate payers, such as health plans, and other managed care entities, such as PBMs, continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs. The negotiating power of MCOs and other private third-party payers has increased due to consolidation, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. These initiatives have increased consumers' interest and input in medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lower-cost generic alternatives. We may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products, or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing.\n\nThe growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions, which typically have smaller patient populations, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, also has generated increased payer interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector.\n\nThird-party payers also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts. Such payers are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. private third-party payer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, we may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers as they continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.\n\nAlso, business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny, and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, as well as evolving judicial interpretations. Our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government and industry guidance.\n\n## COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS\n\nCompetitive product launches may erode future sales of our products, including our existing products and those currently under development, or result in unanticipated product obsolescence. Such launches continue to occur, and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those treated by our inline products and product candidates.\n\nIn addition, competition from manufacturers of generic drugs, including from generic versions of competitors' branded products that lose their market exclusivity, is a major challenge for our branded products. Certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business-Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. In China, we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers, which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products.\n\nIn addition, our patented products may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires, including upon the 'at-risk' launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products. Generic manufacturers have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our patents or claim that our patents are not valid; these include candidates that would compete with, among other products, Ibrance and Xeljanz. Our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights.\n\nWe may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars.\n\nWe also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others, including other biosimilar products. The entry to the market of competing biosimilars is expected to increase pricing pressures on our biosimilar products. Uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors, such as anti-competitive practices, access challenges where our product may not receive appropriate coverage/reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product, physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the innovative product, or misaligned financial incentives.\n\nFor additional information on competition our products face, see the Item 1. Business -Competition section in this Form 10-K.\n\n## CONCENTRATION\n\nWe recorded direct product and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products that collectively accounted for 75% of our total revenues in 2021. In particular, Comirnaty/BNT162b2 accounted for 45% of our total revenues in 2021. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 17 . If these products or any of our other major products were to experience loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription or vaccination growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects or safety concerns, regulatory proceedings, negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing and access pressures or supply shortages or if a new, more effective product should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant. In particular, certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and patents covering a number of our best-selling products are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For additional information on our patents, see the Item 1. Business -Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K.

      "answer": "Danaher reported that real or perceived efficacy concerns could lead to increased R&D costs as the company must invest in innovation to differentiate its products and avoid commoditization. Pfizer specifically incurred additional R&D expenses due to the FDA-mandated post-marketing studies for Xeljanz, including the ORAL Surveillance trial, which led to label revisions and boxed warnings. While exact dollar figures are not provided in the excerpts, both companies explicitly tied increased R&D investment to efficacy-related pressures\u2014one to maintain competitive differentiation and the other to meet regulatory requirements.",

          "chunk_text": "## We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.\n\nOur businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to 'Item 1. Business-Competition' for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements (for example increased demand for products incorporating digital capabilities or more environmentally-friendly products and supplier practices) as well as changes in the way healthcare services are delivered (including the movement of some care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management). Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector, particularly in the healthcare industry, are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs and improve efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. In addition, the Company's competitors and customers have from time to time introduced, and may in the future introduce, private label, generic or low-cost products that compete with the Company's products at lower price points. Competitors' products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial statements.\n\n## Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.\n\nWe generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statements will suffer. Our success depends on several factors, including our ability to:\n\n- correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;\n- allocate our R&amp;D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;\n- anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations;\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization;\n- innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;\n- obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;\n- obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and\n- stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.\n\nIf we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in R&amp;D of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements. Even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which may detract from our sales.",

          "chunk_text": "assessments, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Further regulatory agency requirements may result in a more challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for, among other things, additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval, or increased post-approval requirements. For these and other reasons discussed in this Risk Factors section, we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.\n\n## POST-AUTHORIZATION/APPROVAL DATA\n\nAs a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product, the FDA may require additional clinical trials or other studies. The results generated in these trials could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects, efficacy or safety. Regulatory agencies in countries outside the U.S. often have similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements. Postmarketing studies and clinical trials, whether conducted by us or by others, whether mandated by regulatory agencies or conducted voluntarily, and other emerging data about products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as one of our products, those concerns could implicate the entire class; and this, in turn, could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as other products in the class. The potential regulatory and commercial implications of post-marketing study results typically cannot immediately be determined. For example, in December 2021, in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance (A3921133), the U.S. label for Xeljanz was revised. Updates include a new boxed warning for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and updated boxed warnings regarding mortality, malignancies and thrombosis (with corresponding updates to applicable warnings and precautions). In addition, indications for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA or active PsA, and patients who are two years of age and older with active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis have been revised; Xeljanz is now indicated in patients who have had inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor blockers. In addition, at the request of the EC, the PRAC of the EMA has adopted a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to assess safety information relating to oral JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases, including Xeljanz and Cibinqo, which is ongoing. We continue to work with regulatory agencies to review the full results and analyses of ORAL Surveillance and their impact on product labeling.\n\nThe terms of our EUA for Comirnaty require that we conduct post-authorization observational studies in patients at least 5 years of age or older who received a booster dose, or other populations of interest including healthcare workers, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and subpopulations with specific comorbidities. Additionally, in relation to the FDA approval for Comirnaty, we are required to complete certain postmarketing study requirements and commitments by 2024 as identified in the August 2021 approval letter. The terms of our EUA for Paxlovid require monitoring for convergence of global viral variants of SARS-CoV-2 and potential assessment of Paxlovid activity against identified global variants of interest. Additionally, in relation to the potential FDA approval for Paxlovid, we are required to complete certain other analyses and studies as identified in the December 2021 authorization letter.\n\n## LEGAL MATTERS\n\nWe are and may be involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, including personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, commercial and other asserted and unasserted matters, environmental, government investigations, employment, tax litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nClaims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations.\n\nGovernment investigations and actions could result in substantial fines and/or criminal charges and civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions, as well as reputational harm, including as a result of increased public interest in the matter. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.\n\nOur sales and marketing activities and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the FCPA and other federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the Anti-Kickback Statute, antibribery laws, the False Claims Act, and similar laws in international jurisdictions. In addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws, the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation, settlement precedent, advisory opinions, and special fraud alerts. Our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments. Requirements or industry standards in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions. If an interaction is found to be improper, government enforcement actions and penalties could result. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time-to-time received, and may receive in the future, inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities. In addition, we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities, brought by governmental authorities, as well as consumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. Such claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged non-compliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product (approved and unapproved) information, potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including social media, mobile applications and blogger outreach.\n\nIn connection with the resolution of a U.S. government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, in 2018, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is effective for a period of five years. In the CIA, we agreed to implement and/or maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. Breaches of the CIA could result in severe sanctions against us.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n18",

Abbott's strategy for equity investments included a mix of U.S. large cap indices, mid and small cap indices, and non-U.S. equities in both developed and emerging markets. These allocations reflect a similarly diversified approach to managing risk and return. While both companies emphasized balancing volatility and return through diversification, Abbott's strategy was more explicitly segmented across U.S. and non-U.S. markets, and included actively managed and index funds with specific benchmarks, whereas AbbVie's approach focused on achieving a desired return through broad diversification without specifying geographic breakdowns. This indicates that while both companies aim to manage risk through diversification, Abbott's strategy incorporates more geographic and capitalization-based segmentation.",

      "question": "Given the international regulatory requirements described by AbbVie and Abbott for clinical trial applications and product approvals, how might these companies differently allocate their R&D budgets to manage application fees and compliance costs in the European Union and Japan, based on the specific regulatory pathways mentioned?",
      "answer": "AbbVie may allocate a larger portion of its R&D budget to centralized regulatory submissions in the European Union, where it must go through the European Medicines Agency for biotechnology products, leading to a single marketing authorization valid across all EU member states. This centralized approach could reduce application fees and compliance costs compared to decentralized submissions. In contrast, Abbott, with its diverse product portfolio including medical devices and diagnostics, may face more varied regulatory requirements in the EU due to recent changes like the Medical Devices Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, potentially requiring higher compliance-related R&D spending. In Japan, both companies must submit applications through the PMDA and conduct Japan-specific trials or bridging studies, but AbbVie specifically notes that clinical data in Japanese patients are usually required, which may increase its clinical trial costs in Japan compared to Abbott, which may leverage existing global data for some diagnostics under emergency use authorizations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AbbVie must use the centralized procedure in the EU for biotech products, leading to a single marketing authorization valid across all EU states, while Japan requires Japan-specific or bridging clinical trials through the PMDA.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Abbott faces significant regulatory changes in the EU such as the Medical Devices Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, and may be pursuing FDA approval for pandemic-related diagnostic tests previously under EUA, with potential ongoing compliance costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face EU and Japan regulatory costs, but the nature of their products (biotech/pharma vs. diagnostics/medical devices) leads to different regulatory pathways and thus different R&D budget allocations for application fees and compliance."

      "question": "How does the year-over-year revenue growth of ABBV's Creon\u2122 product in the United States compare to the international revenue generated by Abbott's (ABT) gastroenterology portfolio, and what might this suggest about their respective market positioning in gastrointestinal treatments?",
      "answer": "ABBV's Creon\u2122 generated $1,268 million in U.S. revenue in 2023, reflecting a slight decline (-0.8%) compared to 2022. In contrast, Abbott (ABT) markets Creon\u2122 globally as part of its gastroenterology portfolio, which includes additional products for irritable bowel syndrome and liver disease. While ABT does not disclose Creon\u2122's international revenue specifically, its broader gastroenterology portfolio suggests a strategic international presence. This implies ABBV's focus is primarily on the U.S. market with a mature product, while ABT leverages a diversified global gastroenterology portfolio that likely includes Creon\u2122 among other therapies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From ABBV's 10-K, extract the 2023 U.S. revenue for Creon\u2122 ($1,268 million) and its year-over-year change (-0.8%).",
        "Step 2: From ABT's 10-K, identify that Creon\u2122 is part of its gastroenterology portfolio, which also includes other products like Duspatal\u2122 and Duphalac\u2122, and note ABT's international focus in pharmaceuticals.",
        "Step 3: Compare ABBV's specific U.S.-centric performance of Creon\u2122 to ABT's broader international gastroenterology strategy, which likely includes international sales of Creon\u2122.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize that ABBV's market for Creon\u2122 appears concentrated in the U.S. with declining growth, while ABT's international presence and diversified portfolio suggest a different market positioning for gastrointestinal treatments."

      "answer": "Currency exchange controls impact AbbVie and UnitedHealth Group differently based on their international operations. AbbVie reports that price and currency exchange controls are among the regulatory risks affecting its ability to manufacture, market, and sell products globally, with 23% of its 2023 revenue coming from outside the U.S. These controls could restrict AbbVie\u2019s ability to repatriate funds or manage pricing strategies in foreign markets. Similarly, UnitedHealth Group states that currency exchange controls or other restrictions could prevent it from transferring funds from its international operations or converting local currencies into U.S. dollars. This directly affects its ability to manage cross-border financial flows and realize anticipated synergies from international acquisitions. Both companies face operational constraints due to these regulatory requirements, though AbbVie\u2019s risk centers on product commercialization in foreign markets, while UnitedHealth\u2019s exposure lies in managing global financial transfers and integration of international businesses.",

      "question": "How does the presence of competing products in the market affect DHR's operational flexibility and GILD's intangible asset valuation, given their respective risk factors?",
      "answer": "DHR faces operational challenges due to the highly competitive nature of the industries they serve, which limits their ability to pass on cost increases from supply chain disruptions to customers. This constraint, combined with the risk of competing products gaining market acceptance during periods of production inefficiencies, directly impacts DHR's margins and profitability. On the other hand, GILD's intangible asset valuation, particularly for unapproved product candidates, is heavily influenced by the probability of technical and regulatory success, as well as the risk posed by the advent of competing products. For instance, in 2022, GILD recorded a $2.7 billion impairment charge for an HR+/HER2- IPR&D intangible asset due to an expected delay in launch timing and a resulting decrease in market share assumptions caused by the competitive environment. Therefore, while DHR's operational flexibility is constrained by the need to manage cost pressures without alienating customers, GILD's valuation of intangible assets is directly impacted by the emergence of competing products, leading to significant impairment risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DHR's inability to pass on cost increases due to competitive pressures and the risk of competing products gaining market acceptance during production inefficiencies.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - GILD's $2.7 billion impairment charge in 2022 for an HR+/HER2- IPR&D intangible asset due to expected delay in launch timing and reduced market share assumptions caused by the competitive environment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both DHR and GILD are affected by the presence of competing products, with DHR facing constraints in pricing flexibility and operational efficiency, while GILD experiences direct financial impacts through intangible asset impairments due to competitive market dynamics."

      "answer": "A 20% decline in biotechnology stock prices would reduce the fair value of GILD's equity investments by approximately $292 million as of December 31, 2023. This decline could negatively impact biotechnology companies' financial health and R&D spending capacity. Since DHR's genomic medicines business supplies custom nucleic acid products to biotechnology companies for gene therapies, DNA/RNA vaccines, and gene editing technologies, a reduction in biotech R&D investment could lead to decreased demand for DHR's genomic medicines products.",

In contrast, GILD discusses the general uncertainties and risks around tax positions, including the impact of forecasts, tax planning, and regulatory changes, but does not quantify its unrecognized tax benefits or describe specific audit procedures. This difference highlights that DHR\u2019s tax sustainability assessment is subjected to more explicit external scrutiny and detailed disclosure, while GILD\u2019s treatment remains more qualitative and less transparent in terms of specific tax positions or audit involvement.",

Uncertainty in a tax position may arise for multiple reasons, including because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company applies the applicable tax law and judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were approximately $1.2 billion. Auditing the recognition and measurement of certain of the Company's tax positions including the evaluation of whether such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, and if applicable the measurement of the benefit, is complex and required the use of tax subject matter resources.   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit            | We tested controls over management's accounting for tax positions, including assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and if applicable, the measurement of the benefit of the tax position. To evaluate whether the technical merits of certain of the Company's income tax positions are more likely than not sustainable, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of applicable tax law, court cases, tax regulations and other regulatory guidance by our tax subject matter resources. For certain of the income tax positions, we also involved tax subject matter resources in corroborating our understanding of the relevant facts, examining the Company's analysis, evaluating relevant correspondence with the tax authority and reading third-party advice obtained by management, as applicable. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company's disclosures included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.                                                                        |\n| /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                               | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. | We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Tysons, Virginia February 21, 2024                  | Tysons, Virginia February 21, 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |",

Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited  from  technological  advantages  of  certain  of  its  current  products,  these  advantages  may  be  reduced  or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.",

      "question": "How might changes in U.S. reimbursement regulations for healthcare products impact both MDT's device sales and Pfizer's transition of Comirnaty to traditional commercial markets in 2024, based on their respective risk disclosures?",
      "answer": "Changes in U.S. reimbursement regulations could negatively impact both MDT's device sales and Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccine transition to traditional commercial markets in 2024. For MDT, the company explicitly states that adverse decisions regarding reimbursement systems could significantly reduce reimbursement rates or result in denial of coverage, which could directly affect product demand and pricing that customers are willing to pay. For Pfizer, while Comirnaty transitioned to traditional commercial market sales in the U.S. in September 2023, the company notes that government pressures and regulatory frameworks continue to impact pricing and market access. Both companies operate in a healthcare environment where reimbursement policies directly influence commercial success, though they do not have a direct business relationship.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MDT discloses that changes in reimbursement regulations could 'significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage,' directly impacting 'the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Pfizer notes that Comirnaty transitioned to traditional commercial market sales in the U.S. in September 2023, and that government pressures can lead to 'negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to regulatory frameworks affecting reimbursement and pricing in healthcare markets, though they are not directly connected through business relationships. MDT's device sales and Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccine both face commercial risks tied to evolving reimbursement policies that could impact revenue and market access strategies."

      "answer": "The combined fiscal year 2024 favorable earnings impact from tax incentive grants for Medtronic and Merck is $229 million, based solely on Medtronic\u2019s reported benefit, as Merck does not disclose a specific dollar amount for its fiscal year 2024 benefit but confirms it operates under similar tax incentive grants in Puerto Rico and Singapore that begin to expire in 2025.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Medtronic's 2024 10-K filing, the company explicitly states that tax incentive grants in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and China favorably impacted earnings by $229 million in fiscal year 2024.",
        "Step 2: Merck\u2019s 2024 10-K filing confirms it operates under tax incentive grants in Puerto Rico and Singapore, which begin to expire in 2025, similar to Medtronic\u2019s, but does not disclose a specific dollar amount for the fiscal year 2024 benefit.",
        "Step 3: Since Merck does not provide a specific figure for the 2024 benefit of these tax incentive grants, only Medtronic\u2019s $229 million is quantitatively included in the combined impact."

While the Opinion rejected  the  IRS's  position  and  the  Tax   Court  determined  the  methodology  advanced  by  Medtronic  was  appropriate  for  purposes  of  determining  the intercompany royalty rate between Puerto Rico and the U.S., it determined that the royalty rate should be higher, thereby increasing income allocated to the U.S. and consequently subject to U.S. tax. This case relates only to fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Company has assumed the Tax Court findings will be applied for all years following fiscal year 2006.\n- A cost of $55 million related to the disallowance of certain interest deductions.\n- A cost of $30 million related to the change in reporting currency for certain carryover attributes.\n- A cost of $28 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n- A net cost of $33 million primarily associated with the sale of half of the Company's RCS business.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the net benefit from certain tax  adjustments of $50 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:\n\n- A benefit of $82 million associated with a step up in tax  basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes.\n- A benefit of $82 million related to a change in tax  rates on intangible assets.\n- A cost of $47 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n- A cost of $41 million associated with a change in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings.\n- A net cost of $26 million primarily associated with an intercompany sale of assets.\n\nCurrently, the Company's operations in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and China have various tax holidays and tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by $229 million, $115 million, and $248 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and diluted earnings per share by $0.17, $0.09, and $0.18, in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon the Company meeting certain thresholds required under statutory law. The tax incentive grants, unless extended, will expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2049. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2024 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15% in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2025. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. There are no impacts of this global minimum tax in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024.",

In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.\n\nWe operate  in  an  industry  characterized  by  ex tensive  intellectual  property  litigation.  Intellectual  property  litigation  may  result  in  significant  damage  awards  and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.\n\n## Sales and Distribution\n\nWe sell our medical devices and therapies through a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors globally. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. Our medical supply products are used primarily in hospitals, surgical centers, and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our four largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, China, and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain under-penetrated.\n\nOur marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide. To achieve this objective, our marketing and sales teams are organized around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products.\n\nWe are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.\n\n## Competition, Industry, and Cost Containment\n\nWe compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances, innovations and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products.  In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies, including those producing glucagon-like peptide-1s (GLP-1s).\n\nMajor shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product corrective actions, physician advisories, safety alerts, results of clinical trials to support superiority  claims,  and  publications  about  our  products,  reflecting  the  importance  of  product  quality,  product  efficacy  and  quality  systems  in  the  medical  device industry. In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, declining reimbursement rates, and national and provincial tender pricing, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our business. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products.\n\nGovernment and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These initiatives put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. G overnment programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance, managed-care plans, and volume-based procurement tenders in China, have attempted to control costs by  limiting  the  amount  of  reimbursement  they  will  pay  for  particular  procedures  or  treatments,  tying  reimbursement  to  outcomes,  shifting  to  population  health management, and other mechanisms. Hospitals, which purchase our technology, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, centralized purchasing, and in some cases, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization. This has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products.",

(1)\n\n## Competition and the Health Care Environment\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company's competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company's operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the  Company's  products  mature,  as  well  as  technological  advances  of  competitors,  industry  consolidation,  patents  granted  to  competitors,  competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors' branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. A n adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products.\n\nPharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively . With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations, and has been refining its sales and marketing  efforts  to  address  changing  industry  conditions.  However,  the  introduction  of  new  products  and  processes  by  competitors  may  result  in  price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease ty pically  increases ov er time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales of the Company's products in that therapeutic category.\n\nThe highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company's products as well as competitors' products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.\n\n## Health Care Environment and Government Regulation\n\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of M edicare, M edicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company's sales performance in 2024 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. In the U.S., the Executive Branch and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect sales and profits.",

      "question": "How does the shared exposure to 'Private Insurance Plans' as a third-party reimbursement mechanism create specific and distinct financial risks for both Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, based on the vulnerabilities each company highlights in its 2023 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson highlights that global sales in its Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by increasing pricing pressures from private insurance plans and other third-party payors as part of broader healthcare cost containment efforts. This includes the potential for reduced reimbursement rates, which could directly affect revenues. Similarly, Medtronic notes that its business depends heavily on customers\u2014such as hospitals and physicians\u2014being able to obtain appropriate reimbursement from private insurance plans for the use of its devices and therapies. If reimbursement becomes inadequate or restricted, it could directly influence product selection and pricing, thereby reducing Medtronic's revenues. Both companies are exposed to the risk that private insurance plans may limit or reduce reimbursements, which could lead to lower sales and profitability for both, albeit through different product lines and market channels.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Johnson & Johnson notes that sales in its Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments are significantly affected by reimbursements from private insurance plans and that increasing pricing pressures could negatively impact revenues.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Medtronic states that its customers rely on reimbursement from private insurance plans for its products and that inadequate reimbursement could affect product selection and pricing, directly impacting revenues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to the same connector entity, 'Private Insurance Plans,' as a key reimbursement mechanism. Each highlights that reduced or inadequate reimbursement from these plans could lead to lower revenues and profitability, though the specific products and customer channels differ."

      "question": "How might the potential enforcement of the HHS drug pricing disclosure rule, if reinstated, affect both CVS's PBM operations and Gilead's rebate strategies under Medicare and Medicaid programs?",
      "answer": "If the HHS drug pricing disclosure rule is reinstated, it could reduce the discounts and rebates CVS receives from drug manufacturers by increasing transparency and potentially limiting the negotiating power of PBMs like CVS. This would impact CVS's profitability, especially regarding its ability to manage drug costs and provide competitive pricing. For Gilead, increased scrutiny and transparency around rebates under Medicare and Medicaid programs could lead to challenges in maintaining current rebate structures, as regulators may question or challenge the company's pricing methodologies. This could result in financial liability or the need to restate previously reported pricing data, compounding compliance costs and rebate-related risks for Gilead.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The HHS drug pricing disclosure rule requires plans and issuers to disclose negotiated rates for prescription drugs, and if reinstated, may result in drug manufacturers lowering discounts or rebates, impacting the ability of PBMs like CVS to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products and services.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Gilead notes that government price reporting and payment regulations are complex and subject to review, and if the government disagrees with reported calculations, Gilead may need to restate previously reported data and could face additional financial and legal liability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The potential enforcement of the HHS disclosure rule could simultaneously reduce CVS\u2019s rebate income and increase regulatory scrutiny of Gilead\u2019s rebate reporting, creating dual financial and operational risks for both companies under the shared regulatory framework of Medicare and Medicaid programs."

          "chunk_text": "state governments also are considering changes in the interpretation, enforcement and/or application of existing programs, laws and regulations, including changes to payments under and funding of Medicare and Medicaid programs and increased regulation of PBMs.\n\nFurther, changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to additional regulation of PBMs (including network restrictions, formulary management affiliate reimbursement, contractual guarantees and reconciliations, or other PBM services), drug pricing or purchasing, patent term extensions and/or purchase discount and/or rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers also could reduce the discounts or rebates we receive. Changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing, including our ability to use MAC lists and collect transmission fees, also could adversely affect our profitability. For example, on October 29, 2020, the HHS released a final rule requiring health insurers to disclose drug pricing and cost-sharing information. The final rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose cost-sharing information upon request, to a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, which, unless otherwise indicated, for the purpose of the final rules includes an authorized representative, and requires plans and issuers to disclose in-network provider rates, historical out-of-network allowed amounts and the associated billed charges, and negotiated rates for prescription drugs. While the specific regulation requiring PBMs to disclose negotiated price concessions was paused under federal guidance released in August 2021, if it resurfaces, the regulation may result in drug manufacturers lowering discounts or rebates, resulting in higher drug costs for patients and impacting the ability of the Company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products and services to consumers.\n\nIn addition, in November 2020, the HHS released the Rebate Rule, which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the AKS for rebates from pharmaceutical companies to PBMs in Medicare Part D and in Medicaid MCOs, replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefit patients with high out-of-pocket costs and to change the way PBMs are compensated. The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to the patient at the point of sale and (ii) for flat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. The PCMA, which represents PBMs, has filed a suit in an effort to block the Rebate Rule, claiming that the Rebate Rule would lead to higher premiums in Medicare Part D and was adopted in an unlawful manner. It is unclear whether the Rebate Rule will be enforceable, whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices, whether list prices in the private market may also be reduced, and what the resulting impact will be to PBMs or the Company. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Act of 2021 delays the effective date of the rebate rule to January 2026, and pending Reconciliation legislation would fully repeal the Rebate Rule.\n\nAdditionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 was signed into law in December 2020 and contains transparency provisions requiring group health plans and health insurance issuers to report certain prescription drug costs, overall spending on health services and prescription drugs, and information about premiums and the impact of rebates and other remuneration on premiums and out-of-pocket costs to the Tri-Departments. No later than 18 months after the first submission and bi-annually thereafter, the Tri-Departments will release a public report on drug pricing trends, drug reimbursement, and the impact of drug prices on premiums. In August, the Tri-Departments deferred enforcement of both the December 2021 deadline for reporting 2020 plan year data and the June 2022 deadline for reporting 2021 plan year data to December 2022.\n\nWe cannot predict the enactment or content of new legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement, interpretation or application, or the effect they will have on our business operations or operating results, which could be materially adverse. Even if we could predict such matters, it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which we compete. Examples of such changes include: the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs, increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing, purchasing and/or importation, changing the laws and regulations governing PBMs', PDPs' and/or Managed Medicaid organizations' interactions with government funded health care programs, changing the tax treatment of health or related benefits, or significantly altering the ACA. The likelihood of adverse changes remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressures, and our businesses and operating results could be materially and adversely affected by such changes, even if we correctly predict their occurrence.\n\nFor more information on these matters, see 'Government Regulation' included in Item 1 of this 10-K.\n\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, many of which are highly complex, we could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions, including monetary penalties, or suffer brand and reputational harm.",

In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, laws and regulations relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and  state  programs,  the  Medicaid  Rebate  Statute,  laws  that  regulate  written  and  verbal  communications  about  our  products, individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of health information. Actual or alleged violations of these laws or any related regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, civil monetary  penalties,  exclusion  from  participation  in  federal  and  state  health  care  programs,  including  Medicare,  Medicaid  and Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense health programs, actions against executives overseeing our business and significant remediation measures, negative publicity or other consequences. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to changing and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices. The resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material.\n\nIn addition, government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, and we are continually assessing the methods by which we calculate and report pricing in accordance with these obligations. Our methodologies for calculations are inherently subjective  and  may  be  subject  to  review  and  challenge  by  various  government  agencies,  which  may  disagree  with  our interpretation.  If  the  government  disagrees  with  our  reported  calculations,  we  may  need  to  restate  previously  reported  data  and could be subject to additional financial and legal liability.\n\nThere also continues to be enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs, and manufacturer donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by  governments  on  reimbursement  and  other  patient  support  offerings,  clinical  education  programs  and  promotional  speaker programs. If we, or our agents and vendors, are deemed to have failed to comply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any  of  these  areas,  we  could  be  subject  to  criminal  or  civil  sanctions.  Any  similar  violations  by  our  competitors  could  also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products.\n\nFor a description of our government investigations and related litigation, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## We are subject to risks if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates.\n\nAs additional studies are conducted subsequent to obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over  longer  periods  of  time  by  many  patients,  including  patients  with  underlying  health  problems  or  patients  taking  other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety, resistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed indications, or to halt sales of a product.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  have  been  moving  towards  more  active  and  transparent  pharmacovigilance  and  are  making  greater amounts of stand-alone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through websites and other means, such  as  periodic  safety  update  report  summaries,  risk  management  plan  summaries  and  various  adverse  event  data.  Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action.\n\n## Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and defend our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally, and to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.\n\nPatents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to:\n\n- obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;\n- preserve trade secrets and internal know-how;\n- defend against infringement of our patents and efforts to invalidate them; and\n- operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others.",

In contrast, CVS highlights that adverse conditions in global capital markets can significantly reduce the liquidity of its investments, such as debt and equity securities, which could impair its ability to meet obligations and negatively affect its financial condition. Therefore, while both companies are in the healthcare sector and focus on the liquidity of investments, CVS faces explicit risks that could undermine this objective during market volatility, making GILD's stated policy more critical to avoid similar vulnerabilities.",

Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets could, in the future, become impaired.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $108.1 billion and $110.7 billion, respectively, of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nEstimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, mortgage loans, alternative investments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.\n\nThe global capital markets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser extent the international financial markets; and volatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments' monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:\n\n- significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders' equity;\n- keeping interest rates low on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities (such as we have experienced during recent years) and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities;\n- reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;\n- causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, mortgage borrowers and/or reinsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;\n- making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for example if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-toperiod volatility in our net income and shareholders' equity;",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and  market  prices.  To  reduce  certain  of  these  risks,  we  enter  into  various  types  of  foreign  currency  or  interest  rate  derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nWe have operations in more than 35 countries worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors  such  as  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  or  weak  economic  conditions  in  the  foreign  markets  in  which  we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nApproximately  26%  of  our  product  sales  were  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  during  2021.  To  partially  mitigate  the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we may enter into foreign  currency  exchange  forward  or  option  contracts.  We  also  hedge  certain  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar  relative  to  exchange  rates  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020  would  have  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  fair  value  of  these contracts of approximately $333 million and $249 million, respectively, and if realized, would have negatively affected earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities and our senior unsecured notes create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows:\n\n- safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk;\n- liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and\n- a competitive after-tax rate of return.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  expected  maturities  and  average  interest  rates  of  our  interest-generating  assets  and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2021:\n\nExpected Maturity\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Anti-Boycott Laws\n\nUnder U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.\n\n## Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations\n\nAs a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, new compliance challenges, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity.  Our  business  relies  on  the  secure  electronic  transmission,  storage  and  hosting  of  sensitive  information,  including  personal information,  protected  health  information,  financial  information,  intellectual  property  and  other  sensitive  information  related  to  our customers and workforce.\n\nOur global operational footprint comes with the obligation for compliance and adherence to individual data security, confidentiality and breach notification laws at the State Level, Federal Level, and International Level. Examples of those laws include the Health Insurance and Portability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) in the U.S., the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) within the European Union, and various other country specific requirements around the world.\n\nBecause the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities, or withdrawal of non-compliant products from a market.\n\n## Regulations Governing Reimbursement\n\nThe delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and comparable state and  non-U.S.  agencies  responsible  for  reimbursement  and  regulation  of  healthcare  items  and  services.  U.S.  laws  and  regulations  are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government's interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services.\n\nU.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals or other healthcare fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party  payers.  In  addition,  as  a  manufacturer  of  U.S.  FDA-approved  devices  reimbursable  by  federal  healthcare  programs,  we  are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\n\nImplementation  of  legislative  or  regulatory  reforms  to  reimbursement  systems,  or  adverse  decisions  relating  to  our  products  by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.\n\n## Environmental Health and Safety Laws\n\nWe are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials.\n\n## Available Information\n\nWe maintain a website at www.medtronic.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) are made available under the 'Our Company - Investors' caption and 'Financials - SEC Filings' subcaption of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nInformation relating to our corporate governance, including our Principles of Corporate Governance, Code of Conduct (including our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and any related amendments or waivers), Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Members of the",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## U.S. Federal Laws and Regulation\n\nWe are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. In addition, our businesses are subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance.\n\nPrivacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. Certain of our operations are subject to regulation under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), which apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information.\n\nOur businesses must comply with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which regulates matters relating to privacy, security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate.\n\nThe use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses are also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to 'opt out' of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations, which may apply to us, as discussed below. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information.\n\nERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those who maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA.\n\n## State Laws and Regulation\n\nHealth Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations, which require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by the state's regulation.\n\nOur health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain affiliated transactions and general business operations.

      "question": "How did the easing of Medicaid redetermination requirements during the pandemic impact MDT's competitive positioning in the medical device market, given UNH's Medicaid-related growth and MDT's reliance on hospital purchasing mechanisms?",
      "answer": "The easing of Medicaid redetermination requirements led to an increase in Medicaid enrollment, as reported by UNH, which served more individuals through Medicaid due to states delaying eligibility reviews during the pandemic. This increase in Medicaid-insured patients likely expanded the pool of reimbursable procedures for hospitals, which are key customers for MDT's medical devices. MDT, which sells its products primarily through hospitals, surgical centers, and alternate care facilities, would have benefited from increased hospital utilization driven by expanded Medicaid coverage. Additionally, MDT's competitive strategy emphasizes cost-effective delivery and pricing competitiveness in an environment of declining reimbursement rates \u2014 a dynamic intensified by Medicaid's cost-containment pressures. Therefore, UNH's Medicaid growth, combined with MDT's positioning in hospital supply chains, suggests a multi-hop causal chain where Medicaid policy changes indirectly supported MDT's market performance by increasing hospital demand for cost-effective medical devices.",

In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole.\n\nWe  operate  in  an  industry  characterized  by  extensive  patent  litigation.  Patent  litigation  may  result  in  significant  damage  awards  and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.\n\n## Sales and Distribution\n\nWe sell  our  medical  devices  and  therapies  through  a  combination  of  direct  sales  representatives  and  independent  distributors  globally. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. Our medical supply products are used primarily in hospitals, surgical centers, and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our four largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, China, and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain underpenetrated.\n\nOur marketing and sales strategy is  focused  on  rapid,  cost-effective  delivery  of  high-quality  products  to  a  diverse  group  of  customers worldwide. To achieve this objective, our marketing and sales teams are organized around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products.\n\nWe are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.\n\n## Competition, Industry, and Cost Containment\n\nWe compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products. In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.\n\nMajor shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, results of clinical  trials  to  support  superiority  claims,  and  publications  about  our  products,  reflecting  the  importance  of  product  quality,  product efficacy  and  quality  systems  in  the  medical  device  industry.  In  the  current  environment  of  managed  care,  economically  motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, declining reimbursement rates, and national and provincial tender pricing, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our business. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products.\n\nGovernment and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These initiatives put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms. Hospitals, which purchase our technology, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, centralized purchasing, and in some cases, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests  with  physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization. This has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products.\n\n## Production and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nWe  manufacture  products  at  manufacturing  facilities  located  in  various  countries  throughout  the  world.  We  purchase  many  of  the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw  materials  are  available  only  from  a  sole  supplier.  We  work  closely  with  our  suppliers  to  help  ensure  continuity  of  supply  while maintaining high quality and reliability. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components.",

The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans.\n\nUnitedHealthcare's revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations decreased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses.\n\n## Optum\n\nTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows:\n\n## Optum Health\n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based arrangements, acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to the factors impacting revenues as well as cost management initiatives and increased investment income. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our value-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners.

Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives.\n\n## Optum Rx\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and cost management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition to the factors contributing to revenue growth, adjusted scripts also increased due to the dispensing of COVID-19 vaccines.",

      "question": "How does the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) influence both J&J's and Eli Lilly's competitive positioning in the pharmaceutical market, particularly regarding their biologic products and exposure to biosimilar competition?",
      "answer": "The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) creates an abbreviated regulatory pathway for biosimilars, which directly affects both Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly by increasing the risk of biosimilar competition for their biologic products. J&J specifically notes that the BPCIA enables biosimilar applicants to challenge innovator patents, leading to potential revenue loss for key biologic products if patent defenses fail or if biosimilars launch 'at risk'. Similarly, Eli Lilly highlights that the BPCIA in the U.S., along with global abbreviated pathways, allows biosimilars to be approved based on reduced data requirements, which threatens the market exclusivity and revenue stability of its biologic portfolio, including products like Jardiance and Basaglar. Both companies face increased legal and regulatory exposure due to the BPCIA, which accelerates competitive pressure and reduces pricing power on their high-margin biologics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From JNJ evidence \u2013 The BPCIA enables biosimilar applicants to challenge innovator patents, potentially leading to significant revenue loss for J&J\u2019s biologic products if patent defenses fail or biosimilars launch 'at risk'.",
        "Step 2: From LLY evidence \u2013 The BPCIA allows biosimilars to be approved on an abbreviated basis, increasing competitive pressure on Eli Lilly\u2019s biologics such as Jardiance and Basaglar, potentially leading to revenue erosion.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize \u2013 Both J&J and Eli Lilly are exposed to the same regulatory mechanism (BPCIA), which facilitates biosimilar competition, thereby threatening the revenue and market exclusivity of their respective biologic products."

      "question": "How does the BPCIA influence both Johnson & Johnson's and Eli Lilly's competitive positioning in the pharmaceutical market, particularly in relation to biosimilar challenges and regulatory uncertainties?",
      "answer": "The BPCIA creates a regulatory framework that enables the approval of biosimilars, which directly affects both Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly by increasing the risk of market competition from generic alternatives. Johnson & Johnson faces biosimilar challenges under the BPCIA, which could lead to a rapid loss of revenues for key biologic products if its patents are invalidated or bypassed. Similarly, Eli Lilly acknowledges the evolving regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA, which introduces uncertainty in how biosimilars will be substituted for innovator biologics and affects its own market dynamics. Both companies must navigate this environment by defending intellectual property and considering their own biosimilar development strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Johnson & Johnson faces biosimilar challenges under the BPCIA, which could result in a 'major portion of revenues for the referenced product' being lost quickly if patents are not successfully defended.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Eli Lilly notes that the BPCIA has led to licensed biosimilars in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and that regulatory interpretation continues to evolve, creating uncertainty in substitution practices and market impact.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to the same regulatory framework (BPCIA), which enables biosimilar competition. This shared exposure to biosimilar risk under the BPCIA creates a parallel challenge for both firms in maintaining market exclusivity and revenue for their biologic products."

      "question": "How does the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) influence the patent litigation strategies and revenue risks for both Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly, particularly in light of the use of IPR proceedings and the potential for rapid revenue loss upon patent challenge?",
      "answer": "The BPCIA creates a regulatory and legal framework that allows biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents of innovator biologics, influencing both Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly's patent litigation strategies. Johnson & Johnson notes that IPR proceedings are increasingly used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation, and if unsuccessful in defending these patents, the company could lose a major portion of revenue for the referenced product in a short period of time. Similarly, Eli Lilly highlights that IPR proceedings, even if they result in a ruling in favor of the patent holder, provide limited precedential value at the PTAB and no value in federal district court, allowing other competitors to challenge the same patent again. This dynamic increases the risk of repeated litigation and potential revenue loss for both companies. Both firms face the risk of rapid revenue erosion due to at-risk launches by generic or biosimilar firms following patent challenges, particularly in the U.S., where the BPCIA and Hatch-Waxman Act provide structured mechanisms for such challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - JNJ notes that IPR proceedings are used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation under the BPCIA, and if unsuccessful in defending these patents, the company could lose a major portion of revenue for the referenced product in a short period of time.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - LLY states that IPR proceedings provide limited precedential value at the PTAB and no value in federal district court, allowing other competitors to challenge the same patent again, increasing litigation exposure and risk of revenue loss.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both JNJ and LLY face similar challenges under the BPCIA, where IPR proceedings allow repeated challenges to their patents, increasing litigation costs and the risk of rapid revenue loss if biosimilar competitors launch at-risk following a patent challenge."

      "answer": "Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) experienced revenue growth in the U.S., Europe, and Rest of the World regions in 2021 due to Eliquis, among other products, with U.S. prices increasing by approximately 2%. Pfizer (PFE) reported that Eliquis, along with other key products, generated over $1 billion in direct product and/or Alliance revenues in 2021, with profits and losses shared equally between PFE and BMY in most markets. Therefore, Eliquis contributed over $1 billion to PFE's revenue and was a key growth driver for BMY across multiple regions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since Eliquis is a jointly developed and commercialized product with profit-sharing, and it contributed over $1 billion to PFE's revenue, it must have also contributed a significant portion to BMY\u2019s revenue through the shared profit model. Additionally, BMY's regional revenue growth in 2021 was attributed in part to Eliquis, indicating its financial significance to both companies."

          "chunk_text": "## Manufacturing and Quality Assurance\n\nWe operate and manage a manufacturing network, consisting of internal and external resources, in a manner that permits us to improve efficiency while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity. Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Given that shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy  process  requiring  significant  capital  and  other  expenditures  as  well  as  regulatory  approvals,  we  manage  and  operate  a flexible manufacturing network that minimizes unnecessary product transfers and inefficient uses of manufacturing capacity. For further discussion of the regulatory impact on our manufacturing, refer to '-Government Regulation' above.\n\nOur significant biologics, cell therapy and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Ireland and Switzerland and require significant ongoing capital investment for both maintenance and compliance with increasing regulatory requirements.  For  example,  the  FDA  approved  our  large  scale  multi-product  bulk  biologics  manufacturing  facility  in  Devens, Massachusetts  in  May  2012  and  we  continue  to  make  capital  investments  in  this  facility.  In  addition,  we  expect  to  continue modification  of  our  existing  manufacturing  network  to  meet  complex  processing  standards  that  are  required  for  our  growing portfolio,  particularly  biologics  and  cell  therapy.  Biologics  manufacturing  involves  more  complex  processes  than  those  of traditional  pharmaceutical  operations.  For  example,  we  completed  our  new  large-scale  biologics  manufacturing  facility  in Cruiserath,  Ireland,  which  was  approved  by  the  FDA  in  December  2019  and  by  the  EU  in  January  2020.  For  our  cell  therapy product candidates and marketed products, including Breyanzi and Abecma , we have invested in our own manufacturing network, including facilities in Bothell, Washington; Summit, New Jersey; and Devens, Massachusetts, as well as third-party manufacturers. Beyond  regulatory  requirements,  many  of  our  products  involve  technically  sophisticated  manufacturing  processes  or  require specialized raw materials. For example, we manufacture for clinical and commercial use several sterile products, biologic products and CAR T products, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. As a result, even slight deviations at any point in their production process may lead to production failures or recalls.\n\nIn addition to our own manufacturing sites, we rely on third parties to manufacture or supply us with all or a portion of the active product ingredient or drug substance necessary for us to manufacture various products, such as Opdivo , Eliquis, Sprycel , Yervoy, Reblozyl, Inrebic, Abraxane, and Pomalyst/Imnovid. We are also expanding our use of third-party manufacturers for drug product and finished goods manufacturing and we continue to shift towards using third-party manufacturers for supply of our mature and other brands . With respect to Revlimid and Thalomid \u00ae, we own and operate a manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland, in which we produce the active product ingredient for Revlimid and Thalomid and  we  contract  with  a  third-party  manufacturer  to provide the back-up active product ingredient for Revlimid and Thalomid . To maintain a stable supply of these products, we take a variety of actions including inventory management and maintenance of additional quantities of materials, when possible, that are designed  to  provide  for  a  reasonable  level  of  these  ingredients  to  be  held  by  the  third-party  supplier,  us  or  both,  so  that  our manufacturing operations are not interrupted. Certain supply arrangements extend over multiple years with committed amounts using expected near or long-term demand requirements that are subject to change. As an additional protection, in some cases, we take  steps  to  maintain  an  approved  back-up  source  where  available  and  when  needed.  For  example,  we  have  the  capability  to manufacture Opdivo internally and have arrangements with third-party manufacturers to meet demand.\n\nIn connection with acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and collaboration arrangements or distribution agreements for certain of our products, or in certain other circumstances, we have entered into agreements under which we have agreed to supply our products to third parties and intend to continue to enter into such arrangements or agreements in the future. In addition to liabilities that could arise from our failure to supply such products under the agreements, these arrangements or agreements could require us to invest in facilities  for  the  manufacturing  of  non-strategic  products,  in  the  case  of  a  divestiture  or  distribution  arrangement,  resulting  in additional regulatory filings and obligations or causing an interruption in the manufacturing of our own strategic products.\n\nOur success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support  their  safety  and  effectiveness.  Product  quality  arises  from  a  total  commitment  to  quality  in  all  parts  of  our  operations, including research and development, purchasing, facilities maintenance and planning, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics and distribution. We maintain records to demonstrate the quality and integrity of data, technical information and production processes.\n\nControl  of  production  processes  involves  established  specifications  and  standards  for  raw  materials,  components,  ingredients, equipment and facilities,  manufacturing methods and operations, packaging materials and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes, on the raw materials, drug substance and the final product and on product samples held on stability to  ensure  that  the  product  meets  regulatory  requirements  and  conforms to our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical analyses, microbiological testing or a combination of these along with other analyses. Quality control testing is provided by  business  unit/site  and  third-party  laboratories.  Quality  assurance  groups  routinely  monitor  manufacturing  procedures  and systems used by us, our subsidiaries and third-party suppliers to ensure quality and compliance requirements are met.",

In the EU, licenses have been granted to third parties to market generic lenalidomide products prior to expiry of our patent and supplementary protection certificate rights beginning in the UK in January 2022 and in various  other  major  market  European  countries  (e.g.  France,  Germany,  Italy  and  Spain)  where  our  supplementary protection certificate is in force beginning in February 2022. In Japan, the estimated minimum market exclusivity date is based on a composition of matter patent, which expires in July 2022. Global revenues for Revlimid are expected to decline to approximately $9.5 billion to $10.0 billion in 2022.\n\nEliquis (apixaban) - an oral Factor Xa inhibitor, indicated for the reduction in risk of stroke/systemic embolism in NVAF and for the treatment of DVT/PE and reduction in risk of recurrence following initial therapy.\n\n- U.S. revenues increased 18% in 2021 due to higher demand. A majority of Eliquis patients enter the coverage gap during the third and fourth quarters which result in lower revenues during the second half of the year.\n- International revenues increased 17% in 2021 due to higher demand and foreign exchange impacts of 3%. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 14%.\n- In September 2021, the Bristol Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance announced that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the U.S. District Court's August 2020 decision finding the composition of matter patent and formulation patent covering Eliquis valid and infringed. Given the decision, the earliest that generic manufacturers are permitted to launch their apixaban products is April 1, 2028, subject to additional challenges.\n- Following the May 2021 expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Eliquis in  Europe, generic manufacturers may seek to market  generic  versions  of Eliquis in  Europe  prior  to  the  expiration  of  our  patents,  which  may  lead  to  additional, infringement and invalidity actions involving our Eliquis patents being filed in various countries in Europe. We believe in the  innovative  science  behind Eliquis and  the  strength  of  our  intellectual  property,  which  we  will  defend  against infringement.  Refer  to  'Item  1.  Financial  Statements-Note  19.  Legal  Proceedings  and  Contingencies-Intellectual Property' for further information.",

Pfizer and BioNTech equally share the costs of development for the Comirnaty program. Comirnaty/BNT162b2 has been granted an approval or an authorization in many countries around the world in populations varying by country. We also share gross profits equally from commercialization of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and are working jointly with BioNTech in our respective territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by market. For discussion on Comirnaty/BNT162b2, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-COVID-19 Pandemic section within MD&amp;A.\n- Eliquis (apixaban) is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with BMS as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate patients. We fund between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study, and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countries where we commercialize Eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to BMS. In certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers.\n- Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas. We share equally in the gross profits and losses related to U.S. net sales and also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we share certain development and other collaboration expenses. For international net sales we receive royalties based on a tiered percentage.\n- Bavencio (avelumab) is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. We jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs and split profits equally related to net sales generated from any products containing avelumab.\n- Orgovyx (relugolix) is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and commercialized with Myovant.

      "answer": "For Thermo Fisher, a 10% depreciation in year-end 2023 non-functional currency exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of $43 million on forward currency exchange contracts, while a 10% appreciation would result in an unrealized gain of $49 million. These figures quantify the sensitivity of their forward currency exchange contracts to exchange rate movements. In contrast, Medtronic used forward currency exchange contracts in anticipation of their June 2024 Euro-denominated debt issuance to manage exposure to exchange rate movements, but the filings do not provide specific quantitative figures for Medtronic's potential gains or losses.

          "chunk_text": "## PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION\n\nBMS is a party to various product liability lawsuits. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged  personal  injury  and  economic  loss.  As  previously  disclosed,  in  addition  to  lawsuits,  BMS  also  faces  unfiled  claims involving its products.\n\n## Abilify*\n\nBMS and Otsuka are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Abilify* . Plaintiffs allege Abilify* caused them to engage in compulsive gambling and other impulse control disorders. There have been over 2,500 cases filed in state and federal courts and additional  cases  are  pending  in  Canada.  The  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  consolidated  the  federal  court  cases  for pretrial purposes in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. In February 2019, BMS and Otsuka entered into a master  settlement  agreement  establishing  a  proposed  settlement  program  to  resolve  all Abilify* compulsivity  claims  filed  as  of January 28, 2019 in the MDL as well as various state courts, including California and New Jersey. To date, approximately 2,700 cases, comprising approximately 3,900 plaintiffs, have been dismissed based on participation in the settlement program or failure to comply with settlement related court orders. In the U.S., no cases remain in the MDL and less than 5 cases remain pending in state courts  (New  Jersey  and  Massachusetts).  There  are  eleven  cases  pending  in  Canada  (four  class  actions,  seven  individual  injury claims). Out of the eleven cases, only two are active (the class actions in Quebec and Ontario). Both class actions have now been certified and will proceed separately, subject to a pending further appeal of the Ontario class certification decision.\n\n## Byetta*\n\nAmylin, a former subsidiary of BMS, and Lilly are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Byetta*. This litigation involved lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs, which include injury plaintiffs as well as claims by spouses and/or other beneficiaries, in various courts in the U.S. The majority of these cases have been brought by individuals who allege personal injury sustained after using Byetta *, primarily pancreatic cancer, and, in some cases, claiming alleged wrongful death. The majority of cases are pending in Federal Court in San Diego in an MDL or in a coordinated proceeding in California Superior Court in Los Angeles ('JCCP'). In April 2020 the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based on federal preemption and a motion for summary judgment based on the absence of general causation evidence in the MDL and JCCP. Both motions were granted in March 2021 and April 2021, respectively. The orders will result in the dismissal of all claims alleging an injury of pancreatic cancer in the MDL and JCCP. Plaintiffs initially appealed the MDL order, but subsequently filed a motion to dismiss their appeal as to Amylin and Lilly. That motion to dismiss was granted on October 5, 2021 making the MDL decision final as to Amylin and Lilly. Plaintiffs may seek appeals  in  the  JCCP. As  of  December  31,  2021,  Plaintiffs'  counsel  have  submitted  dismissals  with  prejudice  in  exchange  for  a waiver of costs on behalf of nearly 60% of the plaintiffs in the JCCP (including injury plaintiffs and spouse/beneficiary plaintiffs) alleging claims against Amylin and Lilly. Additional dismissals are anticipated. BMS sold Byetta * to AstraZeneca in February 2014 as part of BMS's global diabetes business divestiture and any additional liability to Amylin with respect to Byetta * is expected to be shared with AstraZeneca.\n\n## Onglyza*\n\nBMS and AstraZeneca are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Onglyza* . Plaintiffs assert claims, including claims for wrongful death, as a result of heart failure or other cardiovascular injuries they allege were caused by their use of Onglyza* . As of June 2021, claims are pending in state and federal court on behalf of approximately 270 individuals who allege they ingested the product  and  suffered  an  injury.  In  February  2018,  the  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  ordered  all  federal  cases  to  be transferred  to  an  MDL  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Kentucky. A  significant  majority  of  the  claims  are pending in the MDL, with others pending in a coordinated proceeding in California Superior Court in San Francisco ('JCCP'). In August 2021, the MDL and JCCP courts jointly heard evidence regarding the parties' motions to exclude general causation experts. On September 24, 2021, the JCCP court granted defendants' motion to exclude plaintiffs' only general causation expert and largely denied plaintiffs' motions to exclude defendants' general causation experts; on January 5, 2022, the MDL court likewise granted defendants' motion to exclude plaintiffs' expert and denied entirely plaintiffs' motions. As part of BMS's global diabetes business divestiture, BMS sold Onglyza* to AstraZeneca in February 2014 and any potential liability with respect to Onglyza* is expected to be shared with AstraZeneca.",

A  significant number of tax returns that are filed are subject to examination by various Federal, state and local tax authorities.

      "question": "How do the prescription level restrictions in the EU, as described by BMY and LLY, impact the companies' ability to maintain pricing power and market access for new pharmaceutical products?",
      "answer": "BMY notes that in most EU countries, governments regulate pricing of new products at launch through mechanisms like direct price controls, international price comparisons, and reference pricing. Additionally, EU member states frequently impose cost-containment measures such as volume discounts, cost caps, and clawbacks, which can significantly reduce revenue and delay market access by more than a year. LLY similarly highlights that international markets impose restrictions on physician prescription levels and emphasize comparative effectiveness and value assessments, often through formal health technology evaluation processes. These prescription level restrictions force both companies to justify the value of their products more rigorously, delay patient access, and reduce pricing flexibility, thereby negatively impacting their ability to maintain strong pricing power and rapid market penetration for new medicines.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BMY's evidence, extract the specific mechanisms used in the EU to restrict pricing and access: direct price controls, international price comparisons, reference pricing, volume discounts, cost caps, and clawbacks.",
        "Step 2: From BMY's evidence, note the delay in market access of more than a year in some EU markets.",
        "Step 3: From LLY's evidence, extract the global trend of restricting access based on comparative effectiveness and value assessments, including formal health technology assessment processes and prescription level restrictions.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize how these prescription level restrictions across both companies' reports reduce pricing power and delay market access, requiring more rigorous value demonstration for new pharmaceutical products."

          "chunk_text": "The growth and consolidation of MCOs and PBMs in the U.S., such as Optum (UHC), CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESI), has also been a major factor in the healthcare marketplace. As MCOs and PBMs have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities,  they  have  also  been  enhancing  their  purchasing  strength  and  importance  to  us.  Over  half  of  the  U.S.  population  now participates  in  some  version  of  managed  care.  MCOs  can  include  medical  insurance  companies,  medical  plan  administrators, health-maintenance  organizations,  Medicare  Part  D  prescription  drug  plans,  alliances  of  hospitals  and  physicians  and  other physician organizations. PBMs are third parties that support formulary management and contracting for MCOs.\n\nTo successfully compete for formulary position with MCOs and PBMs, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in patient populations. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included. Most new products that we introduce compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Where possible, companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products  that  demonstrate  fewer  therapeutic  advantages  must  compete  for  inclusion  based  primarily  on  price.  We  have  been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO or PBM formularies.\n\nIn many markets outside the U.S., we operate in an environment of government-mandated, cost-containment programs. In these markets,  a  significant  portion  of  funding  for  healthcare  services  and  the  determination  of  pricing  and  reimbursement  for pharmaceutical  products  are  subject  to  either  direct  government  control  at  the  point  of  care  or  governments  having  significant power as large single payers. As a result, our products may face restricted access by both public and private payers and may be subject to assessments of comparative value and effectiveness against existing standard of care. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and/or enacted across-the-board  price  cuts  or  rebate  schemes  as  methods  of  cost  control.  In  most  EU  countries,  for  example,  the  government regulates pricing of a new product at launch often through direct price controls, international price comparisons, controlling profits and/or reference pricing. In other EU markets, such as Germany, the government does not set pricing restrictions at launch, but pricing freedom is subsequently limited. Companies may also face significant delays in market access for new products and more than a year can elapse before new medicines become available to patients in the market. Additionally, member states of the EU have regularly imposed new or additional cost containment measures for pharmaceuticals such as volume discounts, cost caps, cost sharing for increases in excess of prior year costs for individual products or aggregated market level spending, clawbacks and free products for a portion of the expected therapy period. The existence of price differentials within the EU due to the different national pricing and reimbursement laws leads to potential significant parallel trade flows.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive global regulations by regional, country, state and local agencies. The Federal Food,  Drug,  and  Cosmetic Act,  other  Federal  statutes  and  regulations,  various  state  statutes  and  regulations  (including  newly enacted state laws regulating drug price transparency, rebates and drug spending), and laws and regulations of foreign governments govern  to  varying  degrees  the  testing, approval, production,  labeling, distribution, post-market  surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information and promotion of our products. The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing,  development  and  regulatory  review  necessary  for  required  governmental  approvals  is  extremely  costly  and  can significantly delay product introductions in a given market. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major world markets. In addition, our operations are subject to complex Federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  environmental  and  occupational  safety  laws  and  regulations.  We  anticipate  that  the  laws  and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort, time and expense as well as significant capital investments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Outside the U.S.\n\nGlobally, public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value, including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition, third-party organizations, including professional associations, academic institutions, and nonprofit entities associated with payers, are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines, the impact of which are uncertain at this time.\n\nIn most international markets, we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs, which may include price controls, international reference pricing (to other countries' prices), discounts and rebates, therapeutic reference pricing (to other, often generic, pharmaceutical choices), restrictions on physician prescription levels, and mandatory generic substitution. We may experience additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world.\n\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative, regulatory, or payer developments. However, in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional state, federal, and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\n\nSee Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access\" for additional information regarding recent legislative, administrative, and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2021, we employed approximately 8,100 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities, including a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel.\n\nOur internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of diabetes, immunology, neuroscience, and oncology. During the past two years, we have also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for COVID-19. In addition to discovering and developing new medicines, we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses, formulations, and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients.\n\nTo supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including, among others, licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments.\n\nPharmaceutical development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. The following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products:\n\n## Phases of New Drug Development\n\n## \u00b7 Discovery Phase\n\nIn the discovery phase, scientists identify, design, and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development, which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low.",

          "chunk_text": "## PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION\n\nBMS is a party to various product liability lawsuits. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged  personal  injury  and  economic  loss.  As  previously  disclosed,  in  addition  to  lawsuits,  BMS  also  faces  unfiled  claims involving its products.\n\n## Abilify*\n\nBMS and Otsuka are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Abilify* . Plaintiffs allege Abilify* caused them to engage in compulsive gambling and other impulse control disorders. There have been over 2,500 cases filed in state and federal courts and additional  cases  are  pending  in  Canada.  The  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  consolidated  the  federal  court  cases  for pretrial purposes in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. In February 2019, BMS and Otsuka entered into a master  settlement  agreement  establishing  a  proposed  settlement  program  to  resolve  all Abilify* compulsivity  claims  filed  as  of January 28, 2019 in the MDL as well as various state courts, including California and New Jersey. To date, approximately 2,700 cases, comprising approximately 3,900 plaintiffs, have been dismissed based on participation in the settlement program or failure to comply with settlement related court orders. In the U.S., no cases remain in the MDL and less than 5 cases remain pending in state courts  (New  Jersey  and  Massachusetts).  There  are  eleven  cases  pending  in  Canada  (four  class  actions,  seven  individual  injury claims). Out of the eleven cases, only two are active (the class actions in Quebec and Ontario). Both class actions have now been certified and will proceed separately, subject to a pending further appeal of the Ontario class certification decision.\n\n## Byetta*\n\nAmylin, a former subsidiary of BMS, and Lilly are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Byetta*. This litigation involved lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs, which include injury plaintiffs as well as claims by spouses and/or other beneficiaries, in various courts in the U.S. The majority of these cases have been brought by individuals who allege personal injury sustained after using Byetta *, primarily pancreatic cancer, and, in some cases, claiming alleged wrongful death. The majority of cases are pending in Federal Court in San Diego in an MDL or in a coordinated proceeding in California Superior Court in Los Angeles ('JCCP'). In April 2020 the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based on federal preemption and a motion for summary judgment based on the absence of general causation evidence in the MDL and JCCP. Both motions were granted in March 2021 and April 2021, respectively. The orders will result in the dismissal of all claims alleging an injury of pancreatic cancer in the MDL and JCCP. Plaintiffs initially appealed the MDL order, but subsequently filed a motion to dismiss their appeal as to Amylin and Lilly. That motion to dismiss was granted on October 5, 2021 making the MDL decision final as to Amylin and Lilly. Plaintiffs may seek appeals  in  the  JCCP. As  of  December  31,  2021,  Plaintiffs'  counsel  have  submitted  dismissals  with  prejudice  in  exchange  for  a waiver of costs on behalf of nearly 60% of the plaintiffs in the JCCP (including injury plaintiffs and spouse/beneficiary plaintiffs) alleging claims against Amylin and Lilly. Additional dismissals are anticipated. BMS sold Byetta * to AstraZeneca in February 2014 as part of BMS's global diabetes business divestiture and any additional liability to Amylin with respect to Byetta * is expected to be shared with AstraZeneca.\n\n## Onglyza*\n\nBMS and AstraZeneca are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Onglyza* . Plaintiffs assert claims, including claims for wrongful death, as a result of heart failure or other cardiovascular injuries they allege were caused by their use of Onglyza* . As of June 2021, claims are pending in state and federal court on behalf of approximately 270 individuals who allege they ingested the product  and  suffered  an  injury.  In  February  2018,  the  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  ordered  all  federal  cases  to  be transferred  to  an  MDL  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Kentucky. A  significant  majority  of  the  claims  are pending in the MDL, with others pending in a coordinated proceeding in California Superior Court in San Francisco ('JCCP'). In August 2021, the MDL and JCCP courts jointly heard evidence regarding the parties' motions to exclude general causation experts. On September 24, 2021, the JCCP court granted defendants' motion to exclude plaintiffs' only general causation expert and largely denied plaintiffs' motions to exclude defendants' general causation experts; on January 5, 2022, the MDL court likewise granted defendants' motion to exclude plaintiffs' expert and denied entirely plaintiffs' motions. As part of BMS's global diabetes business divestiture, BMS sold Onglyza* to AstraZeneca in February 2014 and any potential liability with respect to Onglyza* is expected to be shared with AstraZeneca.",

Approximately 55 of these lawsuits, covering about 285 plaintiffs, are filed in California state court and coordinated in a Los Angeles Superior Court. Approximately 515 of the lawsuits, covering about 515 plaintiffs, are filed in federal court, the majority of which are coordinated in a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Two lawsuits, representing approximately two plaintiffs, have also been filed in various state courts. Approximately 565 of the lawsuits, involving approximately 800 plaintiffs, contain allegations that Byetta caused or contributed to the plaintiffs' cancer (primarily pancreatic cancer or thyroid cancer); while six plaintiffs allege Byetta caused or contributed to pancreatitis. In addition, one case alleges that Byetta caused or contributed to ampullary cancer. The federal and state trial courts granted summary judgment in favor of us and our co-defendants on the claims alleging pancreatic cancer. The plaintiffs appealed those rulings.\n\nIn November 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California's grant of summary judgment in the MDL based on that court's discovery rulings and remanded the cases back to the U.S. District Court for further proceedings. In March 2021, the U.S. District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants. In April 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, but we have now been dismissed from that appeal. Certain plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss their lawsuits in exchange for a waiver of costs, and individual plaintiffs have begun dismissing their claims based upon this agreement. Approximately 311 of the MDL lawsuits have been dismissed as of February 2022. In the state court actions, in November 2018, the California Court of Appeal reversed the Los Angeles County Superior Court of California's grant of summary judgment based on that court's discovery rulings and remanded for further proceedings. In April 2021, the Los Angeles County Superior Court of California granted summary judgment for the defendants and the parties await entry of the order of judgment. Approximately 17 of the state court lawsuits have been dismissed as of February 2022.\n\nWe are aware of approximately 20 additional potential claimants who have not yet filed suit. These additional possible claims allege damages for pancreatic cancer or thyroid cancer.\n\n## Cialis Product Liability\n\nWe are named as a defendant in approximately 350 Cialis product liability lawsuits in the U.S. which were first initiated in August 2015. These cases, many of which were originally filed in various federal courts, contain allegations that Cialis caused or contributed to the plaintiffs' cancer (melanoma). In December 2016, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) granted the plaintiffs' petition to have filed cases and an unspecified number of future cases coordinated into a federal MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alongside an existing coordinated proceeding involving Viagra . The JPML ordered the transfer of the existing cases to the now-renamed MDL In re: Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) and Cialis (Tadalafil) Products Liability Litigation . In April 2020, the MDL court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all of the claims brought against them by the plaintiffs. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The parties have reached agreement to resolve the majority of claims pending in the appeal and expect those claims to soon be dismissed. \u00ae\n\n## Jardiance Product Liability\n\nFirst initiated in January 2019, we and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of BI, have been named as a defendant in 5 currently pending product liability lawsuits in Stamford Superior Court in Connecticut, alleging that Jardiance caused or contributed to plaintiffs' Fournier's gangrene. Our agreement with BI calls for BI to defend and indemnify us against any damages, costs, expenses, and certain other losses with respect to product liability claims in accordance with the terms of the agreement. All pending cases have been paused to allow for settlement negotiations and dismissals.\n\n## Environmental Proceedings\n\nUnder the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as \"Superfund,\" we have been designated as one of several potentially responsible parties with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites. Under Superfund, each responsible party may be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the cleanup.",

Any regulatory issues affecting Bravecto or disruptions in biologics and vaccine production due to EMA restrictions on biological materials could lead to substantial cost increases or production halts. Similarly, Thermo Fisher is subject to EMA regulations for its pharmaceutical and clinical development services, and as the sole manufacturer for several customer drugs, any regulatory failure could halt production, damage customer relationships, and result in significant financial liability.

For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n(excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.\n\nIn M ay 2024, M SD Netherlands Capital B.V ., a wholly owned finance subsidiary of M erck, completed a registered public offering of \u20ac3.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-dominated senior notes comprised of \u20ac850 million of 3.25% senior notes due 2032, \u20ac850 million of 3.50% senior notes due 2037, \u20ac850 million of 3.70% senior notes due 2044 and \u20ac850 million of 3.75% senior notes due 2054 (collectively , the Euronotes). The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of M SD Netherlands Capital B.V .'s obligations under the Euronotes and no other subsidiary of the Company will guarantee these obligations. M SD Netherlands Capital B.V . is a 'finance subsidiary' as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X  of the Exchange A ct, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of M SD Netherlands Capital B.V . are consolidated in the financial statements of the Company . The net cash proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes.\n\nCertain of the Company's borrowings require that M erck comply with covenants and, at December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\n\nThe aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the next five years are as follows: 2025, $2.6 billion; 2026, $2.2 billion; 2027, $1.5 billion; 2028, $2.1 billion; 2029, $1.7 billion. Interest payments related to these debt obligations are as follows: 2025, $1.2 billion; 2026, $1.2 billion; 2027, $1.1 billion; 2028, $1.1 billion; 2029, $1.0 billion.\n\nThe Company has a $6.0 billion credit facility that matures in M ay 2028. The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company's commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company has operating leases primarily for manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, corporate offices, employee housing, vehicles and certain equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. When evaluating contracts for embedded leases, the Company exercises judgment to determine if there is an explicit or implicit identified asset in the contract and if M erck controls the use of that asset. Embedded leases, primarily associated with contract manufacturing organizations, are immaterial. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that M erck will exercise that option. Real estate leases for facilities have an average remaining lease term of approximately six years, which include options to extend the leases for up to five years where applicable. V ehicle leases are generally in effect for four years. The Company elected to exclude short-term leases (leases with an initial term of 12 months or less) from the lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the Company's leases do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments by asset class. On a quarterly basis, an updated incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the average remaining lease term of each asset class and the Company's pretax cost of debt for that same term. The updated rates for each asset class are applied prospectively to new leases. The Company does not separate lease components (e.g., payments for rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) from non-lease components (e.g. common-area maintenance costs) in the event that the agreement contains both. Merck  includes  both  the  lease  and  non-lease  components  for  purposes  of  calculating  the  right-of-use  asset  and  related  lease  liability  (if  the  non-lease components are fixed). For vehicle leases and employee housing, the Company applies a portfolio approach to account for the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\nCertain of the Company's lease agreements contain variable lease payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or for actual operating expense true-ups compared with estimated amounts; however, these amounts are immaterial. Sublease income was immaterial and there were no sale and leaseback transactions in 2024. M erck's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nOperating lease cost was $348 million in 2024, $339 million in 2023 and $334 million in 2022. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $357 million in 2024, $347 million in 2023 and $335 million in 2022. Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations were $47 million in 2024, $122 million in 2023 and $57 million in 2022.",

These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.\n\n## Credit Facilities\n\nThe company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility ex pires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR)-based rate (for funds drawn in euro), or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company's option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit.\n\n## Commercial Paper Programs\n\nThe company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fix ed or floating basis.\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nInterest is payable annually on the euro and Swiss franc-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the U.S. dollar, euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and yen-denominated private placement notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest, together with swap breakage costs payable to holders of yen-denominated private placement notes who have entered into cross-currency swap agreements. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures and note purchase agreement governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge certain property and assets as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants related to its senior notes at December 31, 2024.\n\nIn 2022 the company completed the full allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds from the 0.000% senior notes due 2025 to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, certain COVID-19 response projects.\n\nIn 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption, the company incurred $26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statement of income.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the following notes outstanding as of December 31, 2024, included in the table above (collectively, the 'Euronotes') in registered public offerings: the 0.00% Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80% Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125% Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625% Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00% Senior Notes due 2051. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International's obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International's other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a 'finance subsidiary' as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time.

          "chunk_text": "\nThe interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) swap rate. The fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate are recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting fair value changes in the swap contracts. In January 2025, the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million related to its 5.00% notes due 2053. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company's investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the Company's medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest rates. Changes in medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the Company's fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. A  sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of M erck's investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively . A  one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively . The fair value of M erck's debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. The fair values of M erck's investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly , include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily IPR&amp;D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. A dditionally , estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts, rebates and returns, depreciable  and  amortizable  lives,  recoverability  of  inventories,  including  those  produced  in  preparation  for  product  launches,  amounts  recorded  for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. A pplication of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements.\n\n## Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\nTo determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, the Company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the Company determines that substantially all of the fair v alue of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. T o be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability  to create outputs.\n\nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair v alues with limited ex ceptions. The fair v alues of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition  date  based  on  expectations  and  assumptions  that  are  deemed  reasonable  by  management.  Given  the  considerable  judgment  involved  in determining fair values, the  Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. A ssets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A ccordingly , the Company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company's intended use of those assets. A ny excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fix ed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Singapore dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Swiss franc. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company's debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024, the company's debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company's fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. G enerally, the fair market value of fix ed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 was $28.53 billion (Note 4). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 would increase by approximately $1.98 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 would decrease by approximately $1.76 billion.\n\nIn addition, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements is subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swaps at December 31, 2024 would decrease by approximately $0.27 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swaps at December 31, 2024 would increase by approximately $0.40 billion.\n\n## Currency Exchange Rates\n\nThe company views its investments in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company's investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency ex change rates. The functional currencies of the company's international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, euro, Swedish krona, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner and Swiss franc. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company's net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2024 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders' equity of approximately $2.05 billion.\n\nThe fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company's contracts would result in an unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of $32 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company's contracts would result in an additional unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $37 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.\n\nCertain of the company's cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $16 million on the company's net income.",

M any of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecy cle dev elopment programs.\n\n## MedTech\n\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the cardiovascular, orthopaedics, surgery, and vision categories. The Cardiovascular (previously referred to as Interventional solutions) portfolio includes electrophysiology products to treat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or A M I cardiogenic shock, circulatory restoration products (Shockwave) for the treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CA D) and peripheral artery disease (PA D), and neurovascular care that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio includes products and enabling technologies that support hips, knees, trauma, spine, sports, and others. The Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies, as well as solutions that focus on breast aesthetics and reconstruction (M entor). V ision products include ACUVUE brand contact lenses and TECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals, and retailers and are used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals, and clinics.\n\n## Geographic areas\n\nThe Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of Business - Innovative M edicine and M edTech. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in the international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\n\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\n\n## Patents\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company's subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.

      "answer": "DARZALEX, produced by JNJ, is a key therapeutic in the multiple myeloma market. AMGN lists DARZALEX as a competitor-marketed product in the U.S. and Europe, indicating that AMGN's own oncology products, such as KYPROLIS, face direct competition from DARZALEX in these major markets. This highlights the strategic importance of DARZALEX to JNJ's oncology portfolio and its impact on AMGN's competitive positioning in the treatment of multiple myeloma.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, JNJ produces DARZALEX (daratumumab), a treatment for multiple myeloma, which is a key product in its Innovative Medicine segment.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, AMGN lists DARZALEX as a competitor-marketed product in the U.S. and Europe, specifically in the context of its own oncology drugs such as KYPROLIS.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since JNJ produces DARZALEX and AMGN competes against it in major markets, DARZALEX plays a significant role in the competitive dynamic between the two companies in the oncology space, particularly in multiple myeloma treatment."

          "chunk_text": "myeloma; ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEA DA  (apalutamide), a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer; IM BRUV ICA  (ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease; DARZALEX (daratumumab), a treatment for multiple myeloma; DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a treatment for multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) Amyloidosis; TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), a ready-to-use bispecific antibody for adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy; X A RELTO (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DV T), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DV T and PE to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CA D) and peripheral artery disease (PA D), for the treatment and secondary prevention of thromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients following the Fontan procedure; OPSUM IT (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the longterm treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA H); UPTRA V I (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous, selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PA H. M any of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecy cle dev elopment programs.\n\n## MedTech\n\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the cardiovascular, orthopaedics, surgery, and vision categories. The Cardiovascular (previously referred to as Interventional solutions) portfolio includes electrophysiology products to treat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or A M I cardiogenic shock, circulatory restoration products (Shockwave) for the treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CA D) and peripheral artery disease (PA D), and neurovascular care that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio includes products and enabling technologies that support hips, knees, trauma, spine, sports, and others. The Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies, as well as solutions that focus on breast aesthetics and reconstruction (M entor). V ision products include ACUVUE brand contact lenses and TECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals, and retailers and are used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals, and clinics.\n\n## Geographic areas\n\nThe Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of Business - Innovative M edicine and M edTech. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in the international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\n\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\n\n## Patents\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company's subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.

      "question": "How does Johnson & Johnson's licensing arrangement for DARZALEX, as stated in its 2024 10-K filing, relate to Amgen's competitive landscape in the U.S. and Europe, given Amgen lists DARZALEX as a competitor-marketed product?",
      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's 2024 10-K filing states that DARZALEX is licensed from Genmab A/S, indicating JNJ's exclusive rights to market the product. Amgen's 2024 10-K lists DARZALEX as a competitor-marketed product in the U.S. and Europe, showing that DARZALEX competes directly with Amgen's products in these markets. This implies that JNJ's licensing arrangement directly contributes to the competitive pressure Amgen faces in its key markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen lists DARZALEX as a competitor-marketed product in the U.S. and Europe.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Johnson & Johnson licenses DARZALEX from Genmab A/S, giving JNJ exclusive rights to market the product.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - JNJ's licensing of DARZALEX creates a competitive dynamic with Amgen in the U.S. and Europe, as DARZALEX competes directly with Amgen's products in these regions."

      "question": "How do Abbott and Medtronic's disclosures regarding remote monitoring services help assess their respective deferred revenue liabilities tied to long-term service obligations as of year-end 2023?",
      "answer": "Abbott explicitly quantifies its remaining performance obligations tied to remote monitoring services at approximately $478 million in its Medical Devices segment, as disclosed in Note 3 of its 10-K filing. This figure reflects obligations related to remote monitoring services associated with previously implanted devices, with revenue expected to be recognized over the next several years. In contrast, while Medtronic also discloses that deferred revenue primarily represents remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance, its filing does not provide a specific dollar amount for these obligations as of fiscal year-end 2023. Together, these disclosures indicate that Abbott provides more granular visibility into its deferred revenue tied to remote monitoring, whereas Medtronic's reporting lacks quantification, limiting comparability and insight into the scale of its long-term service liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott quantifies remaining performance obligations related to remote monitoring services at $478 million in the Medical Devices segment (Note 3).",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Medtronic notes that deferred revenue primarily includes remote monitoring services but does not disclose a specific dollar amount for these obligations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing both disclosures shows that Abbott provides a quantified figure for remote monitoring service obligations, while Medtronic does not, making it difficult to directly compare the scale of their deferred revenue liabilities tied to this service offering."

      "question": "How does the 510(k) regulatory process influence both Abbott's and Medtronic's U.S. medical device market strategies, particularly in terms of time-to-market and classification of devices?",
      "answer": "Both Abbott and Medtronic rely on the 510(k) regulatory process for Class II medical devices in the U.S., which allows them to bring products to market faster than through the more rigorous premarket approval (PMA) pathway. Abbott states that most of its medical device products are Class II devices that follow the 510(k) process, which requires demonstrating substantial equivalence to a legally marketed device. Similarly, Medtronic notes that the 510(k) process is generally less time-consuming and expensive than the PMA process, which is reserved for higher-risk Class III devices. This regulatory pathway enables both companies to reduce development costs and accelerate time-to-market for lower-risk devices, shaping their strategies to focus on Class II products where regulatory hurdles are lower and market entry is more efficient.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott states that most of its medical device products are Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Medtronic explains that the 510(k) process is less time-consuming and expensive than the PMA process and is used for devices that demonstrate substantial equivalence.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies utilize the 510(k) process to streamline regulatory approval for Class II devices, reducing time-to-market and development costs compared to the PMA process."

      "question": "How do Abbott's and Medtronic's use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts differ in terms of their hedging strategies and gross notional amounts, based on their respective 2023 filings?",
      "answer": "Abbott uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases and for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, with a total gross notional amount of $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2023. Medtronic uses similar instruments to manage its exposure to the variability of future cash flows denominated in foreign currencies, with a total after-tax unrealized gain of $229 million as of April 26, 2024, though its gross notional amount is not explicitly stated. Abbott's strategy includes cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, while Medtronic also uses undesignated derivatives and reports gains or losses in different sections of the income statement depending on the hedging designation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott's use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts includes $13.8 billion in gross notional amounts for cash flow hedges and fair value hedges as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Medtronic reports $229 million in after-tax unrealized gains from cash flow hedging instruments as of April 26, 2024, but does not specify the gross notional amount of its foreign currency forward contracts.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for hedging, but Abbott provides a specific gross notional amount while Medtronic focuses on unrealized gains/losses, indicating different reporting approaches to currency risk management."

      "answer": "The combined fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts for ABT and MDT in 2023 is $368 million. ABT reports $169 million as an asset and $231 million as a liability, both based on significant observable inputs, indicating that these contracts are primarily used to hedge long-term debt and are accounted for under fair value hierarchy Level 2. MDT, on the other hand, uses foreign currency forward contracts for three purposes: cash flow hedges, net investment hedges, and undesignated derivatives. MDT reports $229 million in after-tax unrealized gains on cash flow hedges and $197 million in after-tax unrealized gains on excluded components of net investment hedges recognized in interest expense, showing a more diversified use and complex accounting treatment of these instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract ABT's fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts from evidence_source_a - $169 million as an asset and $231 million as a liability.",
        "Step 2: Extract MDT's after-tax unrealized gains on cash flow hedges and net investment hedges from evidence_source_b - $229 million and $197 million, respectively.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the combined fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts - $169 million (ABT asset) + $231 million (ABT liability) = $400 million for ABT; MDT's unrealized gains indicate the contracts' financial impact but not direct fair value.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the differences in accounting treatment - ABT uses these contracts primarily for hedging long-term debt and reports them under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, while MDT uses them for cash flow hedges, net investment hedges, and undesignated derivatives, with impacts on accumulated other comprehensive loss and interest expense.",
        "Step 5: Combine all information to provide a complete answer that reflects both companies' specific use and accounting for foreign currency forward exchange contracts."

          "chunk_text": "## Leases\n\nShort-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components.\n\nThe company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option.\n\nVariable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\n\n## Litigation and Contingencies\n\nLoss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.\n\nThe company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease",

If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but  not  known  or  probable,  and  may  be  reasonably  estimated,  the  estimated  loss  or  range  of  loss  is  disclosed.  Our  significant  legal proceedings are discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nIncome Tax Reserves We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves  dealing  with  uncertainties  in  the  application  of  complex  tax  regulations  in  a  multitude  of  jurisdictions  across  our  global operations. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an  uncertain  tax  benefit,  or  derecognize  a  previously  recorded  tax  benefit,  when  there  is  (i)  a  completion  of  a  tax  audit,  (ii)  effective settlement  of  an  issue,  (iii)  a  change  in  applicable  tax  law  including  a  tax  case  or  legislative  guidance,  or  (iv)  the  expiration  of  the applicable  statute  of  limitations.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  accounting  for  tax  reserves.  Although  we  believe  that  we  have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows.\n\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets primarily include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and  in-process  research  and  development.  Determining  the  fair  value  of  intangible  assets  acquired  as  part  of  a  business  combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, and the assessment of the asset's life cycle. The estimates could be impacted by legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.\n\nThe test for impairment of goodwill requires us to make several estimates related to projected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the goodwill reporting units. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value. We assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually as of the first day of the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.\n\nWe also test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired. We assess the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.\n\nOur tests for goodwill and intangible assets are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, appropriate discount rates,  asset  groupings,  and  other  assumptions  and  estimates. We  use  estimates  that  are consistent with the highest and best use of the assets based on a market participant's view of the assets being evaluated. Actual results may differ  from  our  estimates  due  to  a  number  of  factors  including,  among  others,  changes  in  competitive  conditions,  timing  of  regulatory approval, results of clinical trials, changes in worldwide economic conditions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

      "answer": "Both AbbVie and Medtronic actively monitor the creditworthiness of their customers to mitigate the risk of non-payment of trade receivables. AbbVie specifically establishes an allowance for credit losses based on estimates of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and communicates regularly with customers regarding payment plans. Medtronic, on the other hand, emphasizes the dependency of receivable repayment on the political and financial stability of countries, particularly those with national healthcare systems, and highlights the adverse impact that failure to receive payment could have on its business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. While both companies recognize the importance of creditworthiness, AbbVie focuses on internal estimation and customer communication, whereas Medtronic underscores external geopolitical and economic dependencies.",

          "chunk_text": "No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2021. In 2020, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.\n\n## Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings\n\n## Credit Facility\n\nAbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Access to Capital\n\nThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nThere were no changes to the company's credit ratings during 2021. Following the acquisition of Allergan in 2020, S&amp;P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook.\n\nUnfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.\n\n## Future Cash Requirements\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\npotential countermeasures within Russia may lead to greater uncertainty and geopolitical shifts in Asia that could cause additional adverse impacts on global supply chains and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nMore generally, several governments including the U.S. have raised the possibility of policies to induce 're-shoring' of supply chains, less reliance on imported supplies, and greater national production. Examples include potential 'Buy America' requirements in the U.S. If such steps  triggered  retaliation  in  other  markets  restricting  access  to  foreign  products  in  purchases  by  their  government-owned  healthcare systems, the result could be a significant impact on Medtronic.\n\nOther significant changes or disruptions to international trade arrangements, such as termination or modifications of other existing trade agreements, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political  and  financial  stability  of  those  countries.  In  light  of  these  global  economic  fluctuations,  we  continue  to  monitor  the creditworthiness of customers. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the responses of business and governments to the pandemic, have at times resulted in reduced availability of air transport, port closures, increased border controls or closures, increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain, and countries may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines, and further restrict travel and other activities. Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations.\n\nFinally, changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues, expenses, and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes.\n\n## Consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\n\nMany healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or  have  formed  strategic  alliances.  As  the  healthcare  industry  consolidates,  competition  to  provide  goods  and  services  to  industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n## Healthcare industry cost-containment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components.\n\nMost of our customers, and the healthcare providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that  incorporate  components  we  manufacture  or  assemble  are  used.  The  continuing  efforts  of  governmental  authorities,  insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. If third-party payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients, sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components. The cost-containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., could harm our ability to operate  profitably.  For  example,  managed  care  organizations  have  successfully  negotiated  volume  discounts  for  pharmaceuticals,  and GPOs and IDNs have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies, including us.\n\n## Item 1B.

        "Step 2: From Medtronic plc's 2022 10-K filing, Elavon Financial Services DAC is named in multiple indentures: Supplemental Indenture No. 2 dated March 7, 2019 (Exhibit 4.22), Supplemental Indenture No. 3 dated July 2, 2019 (Exhibit 4.23), and Supplemental Indenture No. 4 dated September 29, 2020 (Exhibit 4.24).",
        "Step 3: Counting the total number of Supplemental Indentures involving Elavon Financial Services DAC across both filings: 1 from AbbVie and 3 from Medtronic, totaling 4 named appearances. However, Exhibit 4.24 from Medtronic specifically lists multiple note maturities (2023, 2025, 2028, 2032, 2040, and 2050), which indicates multiple financial instruments tied to a single Supplemental Indenture. Since the question asks for the number of Supplemental Indentures (not instruments), this single Exhibit 4.24 counts as one. Therefore, the total remains 5 Supplemental Indentures."

      "answer": "The implementation of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in the European Union imposes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements on both AbbVie and Medtronic, affecting their ability to market Class III medical devices. AbbVie, which includes breast implants classified as Class III devices, must comply with the MDR to market in the EU, as stated in their 2022 10-K. Similarly, Medtronic notes that under the MDR, devices with valid CE certificates issued under the previous directives before May 2020 can be placed on the market until May 2024. The transition period provided under the MDR for these devices was 4 years (from May 2020 to May 2024).",

          "chunk_text": "## Regulation - Medical Devices\n\nMedical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the United States. AbbVie's medical device product candidates, including AbbVie's breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market.\n\nUnited States . AbbVie's medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of AbbVie's medical device products, including AbbVie's breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVie's subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie' products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing AbbVie' request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution.\n\nA clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device.\n\nOnce a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or 'off-label' uses along with other labeling restrictions.\n\nEuropean Union. Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (the MDR), which came into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect AbbVie's ability to market and sell AbbVie's products in these countries.",

Properties' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European regulatory authorities such as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom Republic of Ireland and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany, the China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), and other government  agencies  inside  and  outside  the  U.S.  To  varying  degrees,  each  of  these  agencies  requires  us  to  comply  with  laws  and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. Our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations.\n\n## Product Approval and Monitoring\n\nMany countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality of our products. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally obtained in one of two primary ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. This process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process.\n\nIn the E.U., a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and  then,  according  to  their  classification,  comply  with  one  or  more  of  a  selection  of  conformity  assessment  routes.  The  competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017 which imposes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements (EU MDR). The regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on May 26, 2021. Medical devices marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directives before May 2020, can be placed on the market until May 2024.\n\nThe  global  regulatory  environment  is  increasingly  stringent  and  unpredictable.  While  harmonization  of  global  regulations  has  been pursued,  requirements  continue  to  differ  significantly  among  countries.  We  expect  this  global  regulatory  environment  will  continue  to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals  for  our  products.  Regulations  of  the  U.S.  FDA  and  other  regulatory  agencies  in  and  outside  the  U.S.  impose  extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing practices, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers' required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future pre-market approvals or result in  a  substantial  modification  to  our  business  practices  and  operations.  For  additional  information,  see  \"Item  1A.  Risk  Factors\" We are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations .\n\n## Trade Regulations\n\nThe  movement  of  products,  services,  and  investment  across  borders  subjects  us  to  extensive  trade  regulations. A  variety  of  laws  and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across  borders.  These  laws  and  regulations  govern,  among  other  things,  our  import,  export  and  other  business  activities.  We  are  also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. Some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement  action,  and  varying  degrees  of  liability.  Such  actions  may  disrupt  or  delay  sales  of  our  products  or  services  or  result  in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business.",

      "question": "How does the competitive pricing pressure described in both Medtronic's and Merck's 10-K filings influence their respective exposure to financial risk in international markets?",
      "answer": "Medtronic identifies 'decreasing selling prices and pricing pressure' as a material risk factor that could materially affect its business operations and financial results. This aligns with Merck's detailed description of competitive pricing pressure in the European Union, where the company faces downward pricing pressure from generic and biosimilar drugs, reference pricing mechanisms, and health technology assessments (HTAs) that influence reimbursement and pricing decisions. These HTAs, which are increasingly common across EU member states, can result in reduced reimbursement rates or market access barriers for Merck's products. Both companies are exposed to financial risk in international markets due to these pricing pressures, though Merck faces more structured regulatory mechanisms like HTA reviews and reference pricing, while Medtronic faces broader pricing volatility. Together, this indicates that both firms must strategically manage pricing and reimbursement strategies in international markets to mitigate financial exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Medtronic (MDT) identifies 'decreasing selling prices and pricing pressure' as a material risk factor.",

      "question": "How did the impact of regulatory approval delays on Merck's IPR&D impairments in 2023 compare to the risks Medtronic disclosed regarding delays in regulatory approvals, particularly in terms of financial consequences and asset valuation adjustments?",
      "answer": "Merck recorded a $779 million IPR&D impairment charge in 2023 due to the FDA's second Complete Response Letter for gefapixant, which indicated that the drug did not meet substantial evidence of effectiveness. This impairment was directly tied to regulatory delays and the resulting revised market launch plans, which lowered the projected future cash flows and thus the fair value of the asset. In contrast, Medtronic disclosed that delays in regulatory approvals are a material risk factor that could affect its business, including future product launches and financial performance. However, Medtronic did not specify a direct financial impact from such delays in its disclosures. Therefore, while both companies face risks from regulatory approval delays, Merck experienced a concrete financial consequence in 2023, whereas Medtronic outlined the risk in a more general, forward-looking context.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Medtronic disclosed that delays in regulatory approvals are a material risk factor that could affect its business strategy, product development, and financial performance.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Merck recorded a $779 million IPR&D impairment charge in 2023 due to the FDA's second Complete Response Letter for gefapixant, which was a result of delays and failure to meet effectiveness standards.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face risks from regulatory approval delays, but Merck experienced a direct financial impact, while Medtronic only disclosed the risk in a forward-looking context without specific financial consequences."

      "question": "How does the classification of Eastern Europe as an emerging market impact Medtronic's international growth strategy, and how does this compare to Merck's acknowledgment of risks and opportunities in the same region?",
      "answer": "Medtronic classifies Eastern Europe as part of its 'emerging markets,' which are defined as countries in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia. This classification suggests that Eastern Europe contributes to Medtronic\u2019s growth strategy as part of a broader set of developing markets, despite potential instability. In contrast, Merck acknowledges that while Eastern Europe offers growth opportunities, it also presents risks due to the region's economic and political instability. Merck explicitly states that it closely reviews its methods of operation and adapts strategies to changing conditions in these markets. Therefore, while both companies recognize Eastern Europe as a region with growth potential, Medtronic emphasizes its inclusion in the broader emerging market growth narrative, whereas Merck highlights the need for strategic responsiveness to mitigate risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Medtronic's 10-K, Eastern Europe is classified as an emerging market, which includes growth drivers such as the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia.",
        "Step 2: Medtronic's fiscal year 2024 net sales growth was partially driven by strength in international markets, including emerging markets.",
        "Step 3: Merck's 10-K acknowledges Eastern Europe as part of its operations in developing regions, but also notes the instability of these markets and the importance of strategic adaptability.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize both perspectives: Medtronic's focus is on growth potential in Eastern Europe as part of its emerging markets strategy, while Merck emphasizes risk management due to the region's instability."

      "question": "How do the EMA regulatory risks described in Gilead Sciences' (GILD) and Thermo Fisher Scientific's (TMO) 2023 10-K filings differ in terms of potential financial and operational consequences, and what specific regulatory actions could each company face if they fail to comply with EMA requirements?",
      "answer": "Gilead Sciences (GILD) faces potential delays or denial of product approvals, restrictions on product use, and possible withdrawal of products from the market due to EMA regulations. These risks could significantly impact GILD's commercialization efforts and future revenue streams. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), on the other hand, could face adverse regulatory actions such as product recalls, injunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution, monetary sanctions, and withdrawal of existing approvals. These consequences could disrupt TMO\u2019s operations and lead to significant financial liability, especially since TMO is the sole manufacturer for many of its pharmaceutical customers. Both companies are subject to extensive EMA oversight, but the nature of their regulatory risks differs based on their business models\u2014GILD primarily as a drug developer and TMO as a service and product provider in pharmaceutical manufacturing and clinical development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (GILD) - GILD's regulatory risks include delays or denial of marketing approvals, restrictions on product use, and potential product withdrawal, which could materially affect commercial success.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (TMO) - TMO faces risks of product recalls, injunctions, monetary sanctions, and withdrawal of approvals due to EMA-regulated manufacturing and service delivery, which could disrupt customer supply chains.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to EMA regulations, but the operational and financial impacts differ: GILD's risks center on product approval and commercialization, while TMO's risks involve manufacturing compliance and contractual obligations."

      "question": "How do EMA regulations impact both Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) in terms of their clinical and manufacturing operations, and what specific risks does each company highlight regarding noncompliance with these regulations?",
      "answer": "EMA regulations impact both Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) by imposing strict requirements on clinical trial design, manufacturing processes, and regulatory compliance. GILD highlights that its clinical trials are subject to EMA regulations and that failure to meet trial endpoints or comply with regulatory standards could lead to delays in product approvals or the need to conduct additional trials, as seen with the clinical hold on magrolimab studies and the discontinuation of the EVOKE-01 study for sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. TMO, on the other hand, emphasizes that its manufacturing and clinical development services must adhere to EMA standards for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and any failure to meet these standards could result in adverse regulatory actions such as product recalls, injunctions, or monetary sanctions. Both companies face significant financial and operational risks from noncompliance, with GILD potentially recording impairment charges and TMO facing liability claims and increased compliance costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (GILD) - GILD mentions that its clinical trials are subject to EMA regulations and that failure to meet endpoints or regulatory standards could lead to delays or discontinuation of development programs, including impairment charges.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (TMO) - TMO states that its manufacturing and clinical development services must comply with EMA's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and failure to meet these standards could result in regulatory actions such as product recalls, injunctions, and monetary sanctions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to EMA regulations, but in different operational areas: GILD in clinical trials and TMO in manufacturing and clinical services. The risks of noncompliance include financial impacts (impairment charges for GILD, sanctions for TMO) and operational disruptions (delays in approvals for GILD, recalls for TMO)."

      "question": "How does the shared exposure to U.S. federal anti-kickback laws, as described in the 2024 10-K filings, create distinct compliance risks for MDT's device reimbursement processes and UNH's Medicaid and Medicare contract operations, and what are the specific regulatory consequences each company could face if noncompliant?",
      "answer": "MDT faces compliance risks under U.S. federal anti-kickback laws due to its involvement in federally funded healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid, where it must avoid improper financial arrangements that could influence referrals for reimbursed items. If MDT fails to comply, it could face criminal and civil penalties, including fines and exclusion from federal healthcare programs, which would impact its ability to sell FDA-approved devices. Similarly, UNH, through its UnitedHealthcare Community & State division, operates under Medicaid and CHIP contracts subject to federal anti-kickback regulations. Noncompliance could result in contract termination, exclusion from federal programs, and financial penalties. Both companies are exposed to enforcement actions, but MDT's risk centers on device reimbursement and transparency under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, while UNH's risk is tied to the administration of state Medicaid programs and CMS audits.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MDT is subject to U.S. federal healthcare laws, including anti-kickback statutes, particularly in relation to claims submitted for items reimbursed under federally funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. MDT must comply with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires annual reporting of payments to physicians or teaching hospitals.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UNH's UnitedHealthcare Community & State division operates Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal anti-kickback laws. These laws govern services provided, payments made, and the overall compliance with federal healthcare regulations enforced by CMS.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both MDT and UNH are subject to U.S. federal anti-kickback laws, but their exposure differs based on business model: MDT as a medical device manufacturer reliant on reimbursement for FDA-approved devices, and UNH as a managed care provider administering Medicaid and Medicare programs. The consequences of noncompliance\u2014such as fines, exclusion from federal programs, and reputational harm\u2014are shared, but the mechanisms and regulatory bodies involved differ."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Trade Regulations\n\nThe movement of products, services, technology, know-how, and investment across borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import, export and other international trade activities. We are subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs and burdens, as well as penalties if not complied with. Some governments impose economic sanctions and other  trade  restrictions  against  certain  countries,  persons  or  entities.  We  also  sell  and  provide  goods,  technology  and  services  to  agents,  representatives  and distributors who may in turn sell or provide such items to customers and other end-users in their own countries or by means of their own cross-border transactions. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability. Such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business.\n\n## Anti-Boycott Laws\n\nUnder U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.\n\n## Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations\n\nAs a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted, and may continue to  result,  in  increased  costs,  new  compliance challenges, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity.  Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our products and therapies, customers, patients, and workforce.\n\nOur global operational footprint comes with the obligation for compliance and adherence to individual data security, confidentiality and breach notification laws at the State Level, Federal Level, and International Level. Ex amples of those laws include, in the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and various State privacy laws that have become effective recently. We are also subject to various other country-specific requirements around the world, such as the G eneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom's version of the same, and China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL).\n\nBecause the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation,  compliance  with  these  laws  and  regulations  may  require  significant  additional  cost  ex penditures  or  changes  in  products  or  business  that  increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities, withdrawal of noncompliant products from a market, and reputational harm.\n\n## Regulations Governing Reimbursement\n\nThe  delivery  of  our  devices  is  subject  to  regulation  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  and  comparable  state  and  non-U.S.  agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare  programs,  such  as  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid  programs,  as  well  as  the  government's  interest  in  regulating  the  quality  and  cost  of  healthcare.  Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services.\n\nU.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals or other healthcare fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws  that  apply  to  state  Medicaid  and  other  healthcare  programs  and  private  third-party  payors.  In  addition,  as  a  manufacturer  of  U.S.  FDA-approved  devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Similarly, other jurisdictions impose transparency reporting obligations relating to health care professional payments. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\n\nImplementation of legislative or regulatory reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.",

UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State's primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families; Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP); Dual SNPs (DSNPs); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS); Aged, Blind and Disabled; and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2024, UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State participated in programs in 33 states and the District of Columbia, and served more than 7.4 million people; including 1.2 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 20 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nStates using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. These health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in medically underserved areas and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nOur businesses are subject to comprehensive U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by agencies which generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. U.S. federal and state and international governments continue to consider and enact various legislative and regulatory proposals which could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of ex isting laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political environment, could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nSee Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors' for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations.\n\n## U.S. Federal Laws and Regulation\n\nWhen we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts, which are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex.\n\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services, anti-money laundering and securities and antitrust compliance.\n\nPrivacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. Certain of our operations are subject to regulation under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), which apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including selffunded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information.\n\nOur businesses must comply with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which regulates matters relating to privacy, security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate.",

CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Some of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the past have resulted and in future periods could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS.\n\nWe have been and in the future may become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers regarding, among other allegations, claims that we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Government investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted and in future periods could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## Our pharmacy care services businesses face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses.\n\nWe provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Further, various governmental agencies have conducted and continue to conduct investigations and studies into certain PBM practices, which have resulted and in future periods may result in PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements, or could materially and adversely impact the PBM business model. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards. Optum Rx conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration and Boards of Pharmacy.\n\nWe could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, as well as claims related to the inherent risks in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine such fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into prohibited transactions.\n\n## If we fail to comply w ith applicable priv acy, security, technology and data law s, regulations and standards, including w ith respect to third-party serv ice prov iders utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and addressed in requirements of our customer contracts. Additionally, legislative and regulatory action in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, as well as internationally, is emerging in the areas of AI/ML and automation. These laws, regulations and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy, security, technology and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations.\n\nInternationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, information security, and AI/ML and automation in the European Union, UK, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers.",

      "question": "How does the difference in the scale and resolution timeline of tax examinations between Amgen and CVS Health reflect on their respective financial exposures and potential impacts on future tax liabilities?",
      "answer": "Amgen is dealing with a significant unresolved IRS examination for 2010\u20132012 involving profit allocations between its U.S. and Puerto Rico entities, with no resolution timeline provided, indicating a potentially large and prolonged financial exposure. In contrast, CVS Health reports that substantially all material state and local tax matters through 2015 are concluded, with only immaterial changes expected from ongoing exams, and estimates that any potential changes in unrecognized tax benefits within the next year would be around $330 million. This suggests that CVS has a more defined and near-term quantifiable exposure, while Amgen\u2019s remains uncertain and potentially larger in magnitude, affecting long-term financial planning and tax liability forecasting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen is under IRS examination for 2010\u20132012 with proposed adjustments related to profit allocation between U.S. and Puerto Rico entities, and no resolution timeline is given.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - CVS Health reports $330 million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect its effective tax rate, and states that most prior state tax matters are concluded with immaterial changes expected.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amgen\u2019s unresolved and long-standing IRS dispute indicates a potentially large and uncertain future liability, while CVS has a defined and quantified near-term exposure, allowing for clearer financial forecasting."

      "question": "How do Amgen's integration challenges with Horizon's information security systems and CVS's explicit cybersecurity investments reflect contrasting financial and operational approaches to managing information security risks?",
      "answer": "Amgen discloses that integrating Horizon's information security systems is a complex and costly part of its $24 billion senior notes and $4 billion term loan-funded acquisition, contributing to credit rating downgrades and operational disruptions. In contrast, CVS explicitly states that it is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update its information security systems and processes. While Amgen's approach reflects a reactive integration of existing systems post-acquisition, CVS emphasizes proactive, ongoing investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. These differing strategies highlight Amgen's exposure to information security risks through third-party vendors and acquisition complexity, versus CVS's direct financial commitment to mitigating such risks internally and continuously.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen's acquisition of Horizon required $24 billion in senior notes and $4 billion drawn from a term loan, which has resulted in downgrades to its credit ratings and complex integration of Horizon\u2019s information security systems.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - CVS is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update its information security systems and processes.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amgen\u2019s financial and operational exposure stems from integrating third-party systems post-acquisition, while CVS is proactively investing directly in its own cybersecurity infrastructure, reflecting contrasting strategic approaches to managing the same risk category."

      "question": "How do the reimbursement pressures described in AMGN's and CVS's 2023 10-K filings collectively impact the profitability of both companies, particularly in light of AMGN's reliance on third-party payer coverage and CVS's exposure to price compression in its PBM business?",
      "answer": "AMGN states that its profitability is negatively affected by pricing and reimbursement pressures from government and commercial third-party payers. This is a critical risk since its sales depend heavily on such coverage. Similarly, CVS notes that reimbursement pressures, particularly in its PBM business, are causing price compression and reducing profitability. These pressures force CVS to reevaluate pricing structures and may lead to margin compression. Together, these factors indicate that reimbursement challenges are limiting revenue growth and profitability for both companies, despite their different roles in the healthcare ecosystem\u2014AMGN as a drug manufacturer and CVS as a PBM and pharmacy operator.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMGN 2023 10-K - 'Pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from CVS 2023 10-K - 'A significant increase in price compression and/or reimbursement pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive.' and 'Marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have adversely affected our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail 'differential' or 'spread,' which could adversely affect our future profitability.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face profitability risks due to reimbursement pressures, though they operate in different segments of the healthcare industry. AMGN's risk stems from payer coverage affecting drug sales, while CVS faces margin compression due to competitive and client-driven pricing pressures in its PBM operations. The combined effect is a systemic profitability challenge across the drug supply chain."

      "answer": "Amgen states that reimbursement pressures have affected and will continue to affect its profitability, as pricing and coverage decisions by regulatory agencies and payors could lead to decreased product use, dosage, or reimbursement, materially impacting sales and operations. Specifically, EU regulations effective in 2025 aim to harmonize clinical assessments, which may result in decreased reimbursement for Amgen\u2019s products. At the same time, CVS notes that reimbursement pressures in its Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and PBM businesses are causing margin compression due to client demands for lower prices, generic drug pricing pressures, and earlier-than-expected generic introductions. These pressures are compounded by network reimbursement constraints and limitations on using retail 'differentials' in pricing. Together, these dynamics illustrate a systemic risk in the healthcare value chain where reduced reimbursement at the payer level affects both drug manufacturers like Amgen (through lower sales and pricing power) and pharmacy providers like CVS (through reduced margins and pricing flexibility).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen notes that reimbursement pressures have affected and will continue to affect its profitability, particularly with new EU regulations effective in 2025 that could reduce reimbursement for its products.",

      "answer": "Pfizer emphasizes that unique product features such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, and fewer side effects are critical in securing favorable formulary placement with Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), which directly affects product demand and financial performance. In contrast, Thermo Fisher Scientific highlights that its competitive success is driven by technical performance, product differentiation, reliability, and active research and application-development programs. Both companies rely on product innovation and differentiation to maintain market positioning, but Pfizer\u2019s focus is on patient-centric and cost-of-therapy advantages in a managed care environment, while Thermo Fisher\u2019s approach centers on technological advancement and customer service in a broader scientific and industrial market context.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Pfizer notes that 'unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects' are key to securing formulary inclusion and competing effectively against alternative therapies.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Thermo Fisher states that its success 'primarily depends on technical performance and advances in technology, product differentiation, availability and reliability, customer service and support, and active research and application-development programs.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on unique product features to maintain competitive advantage, but the nature and application of these features differ based on their respective markets: Pfizer in healthcare with MCO-driven formulary access, and Thermo Fisher in life sciences and industrial markets with a focus on technological and service differentiation."

          "chunk_text": "medicines, or are using utilization m anagem ent tools or lim iting access on form ularies. T his trend is likely to continue. P rivate third-party payors, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharm aceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reim bursem ent rates for payors and a reduction in dem and for our products, including denial of coverage of our products, if lower cost alternatives are available. P ayors often require significant discounts, or rebates, from  our prices in exchange for m ore favorable form ulary placem ent. P ricing pressures also m ay occur as a result of highly com petitive biopharm aceutical m arkets and increasing concentration of insurers and P BM s. H ealthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or im plem enting m ore rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.\n\nWe believe m edicines and vaccines are the m ost efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system . W e work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively im prove patient health outcom es, lower costs to the healthcare system , and help ensure access to m edicines and vaccines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system . T his includes assessing our go-to m arket m odel to help address patient affordability challenges. W e have engaged with m ajor payors and the U .S. governm ent to explore opportunities to im prove access and reim bursem ent in an effort to drive pro-patient policies. In addition, in response to the evolving U .S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we work with health authorities, health technology assessm ent and quality m easurem ent bodies and m ajor U .S. payors throughout the productdevelopm ent process to better understand how these entities value our com pounds and products. Further, we are developing stronger support designed to dem onstrate the value of the m edicines and vaccines that we discover or develop, register and m anufacture.\n\nFor inform ation on governm ent pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors -Pricing and Reimbursement sections.\n\nManaged Care Organizations. The evolution of m anaged care in the U .S. has been a m ajor factor in the com petitiveness of the healthcare m arketplace. Approxim ately 317 m illion people in the U .S. now have som e form  of health insurance coverage, and the m arketing of prescription drugs and vaccines to both consum ers and the entities that m anage coverage in the U .S. continues to grow in im portance. In particular, the influence of M C O s has increased in recent years due to the growing num ber of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the sam e tim e, consolidation in the M C O  industry has resulted in fewer, even larger M C O s, which enhances those M C O s' ability to negotiate lower pricing and further increases their im portance to our business. Since M C O s purport to seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures, their growing influence has increased downward pressure on drug prices, as well as negatively im pacted revenues.\n\nMCOs and their P BM s typically negotiate prices with pharm aceutical providers by using form ularies (which are lists of approved m edicines available to M C O  m em bers), clinical protocols (which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or m ore generic products before perm itting access to a branded m edicine), long-term  contracts and their ability to influence volum e and m arket share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded m edicines on highertier or non-preferred status in their form ularies, M C O s transfer to the patient higher patient out-of-pocket expenses. T his financial disincentive is a tool for M C O s to m anage drug costs and channel patients to m edicines preferred by the M C O s. W e expect paym ent reform s for M C O s will continue to evolve with increased em phasis on expanded participation and on rem oving barriers to equitable healthcare.\n\nThe breadth of the products covered by form ularies can vary considerably from  one M C O  to another, and m any form ularies include alternative and com petitive products for treatm ent of particular m edical problem s. M C O s em phasize prim ary and preventive care, out-patient treatm ent and procedures perform ed at doctors' offices and clinics as ways to m anage costs. H ospitalization and surgery, typically the m ost expensive form s of treatm ent, are carefully m anaged, and drugs that can help in chronic care m anagem ent and reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy or surgery m ay becom e favored first-line treatm ents for certain diseases. At the sam e tim e, M C O s m ay seek to exclude high-cost drugs from form ularies in their efforts to m anage and lower their costs.\n\nExclusion of a product from  a form ulary or other restrictions can significantly im pact drug usage in the M C O  or P BM  m anaged patient population and beyond. C onsequently, pharm aceutical com panies com pete to gain access to form ularies for their products, typically on the basis of unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, as well as the overall cost of the therapy. W e continue to seek to ensure that our m ajor products are included on M C O  form ularies. H owever, our branded products are increasingly being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. C ontinuing efforts by m anaged care entities to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or im pose price controls m ay adversely affect dem and for our products and our financial perform ance. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Managed Care Trends section.\n\n## RAW MATERIALS\n\nWe procure raw m aterials essential to our business from  num erous suppliers worldwide.

We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position.\n\n## Resources\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nOur management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. No single supplier is material, although for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design, certain materials components may be sourced from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such materials or components.\n\nRaw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results.\n\n## Patents, Licenses and Trademarks\n\nPatents are important in many aspects of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.\n\nWe protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products.

To the extent other trademarks appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, they are the property of their respective owners.\n\n## Seasonal Influences\n\nRevenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of seasonal products, such as allergy and flu tests and related diagnostic products, vary quarter to quarter and year to year.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers, third-party distributors and service providers. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors:\n\n- technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios;\n- product differentiation, availability and reliability;\n- the depth of our capabilities;\n- our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services;\n- customer service and support;\n- active research and application-development programs; and\n- relative prices of our products and services.",

A valuation allowance is provided for tax assets that will more likely than not go unused.\n\nThe financial statements reflect ex pected future tax  consequences of uncertain tax  positions that the company has taken or ex pects to take on a tax  return presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (see Note 7).\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Singapore dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Swiss franc. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the eurodenominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nThe fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is included in the accompanying balance sheets under the caption other assets or other long-term liabilities. The fair value of the currency exchange contracts is included in the accompanying balance sheets under the captions other current assets or other accrued expenses.\n\n## Leases\n\nOperating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases that have commenced are included in property, plant and equipment, net, current maturities of long-term obligations and long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the ex pected timing of payments due under the company's obligations.\n\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes operating lease",

In contrast, Pfizer does not disclose a specific quantified impact on shareholders' equity from a krona depreciation. However, Pfizer's 10-K reveals that it uses foreign currency debt and derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk, including exposure to the Swedish krona, which would mitigate the impact on net income and shareholders' equity from currency translation.

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fix ed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Singapore dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Swiss franc. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company's debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024, the company's debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company's fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. G enerally, the fair market value of fix ed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 was $28.53 billion (Note 4). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 would increase by approximately $1.98 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 would decrease by approximately $1.76 billion.\n\nIn addition, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements is subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swaps at December 31, 2024 would decrease by approximately $0.27 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swaps at December 31, 2024 would increase by approximately $0.40 billion.\n\n## Currency Exchange Rates\n\nThe company views its investments in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company's investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency ex change rates. The functional currencies of the company's international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, euro, Swedish krona, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner and Swiss franc. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company's net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2024 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders' equity of approximately $2.05 billion.\n\nThe fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company's contracts would result in an unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of $32 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company's contracts would result in an additional unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $37 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.\n\nCertain of the company's cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $16 million on the company's net income.",

      "answer": "A shared disruption in contract manufacturing capacity would significantly impact both Amgen and Pfizer due to their reliance on third-party manufacturers and the time required to qualify new ones. Amgen disclosed that qualifying and licensing a new contract manufacturer can take over three years, which means any disruption would leave them unable to quickly find alternatives, increasing the risk of stock-outs. Pfizer, already facing $500 million in inventory write-offs in 2023 due to supply chain imbalances, would be further exposed to excess inventory costs if manufacturing delays led to mismatches between production and demand. Since both companies operate in the same therapeutic markets\u2014such as oncology and vaccines\u2014and rely on complex global supply chains, a shared disruption would compound their challenges in maintaining supply continuity and inventory efficiency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen states that qualifying a new contract manufacturer can take over three years, directly impacting their ability to respond to manufacturing disruptions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face risks from supply chain disruptions. Amgen\u2019s long lead time to qualify new manufacturers would delay recovery from a shared contract manufacturing failure, increasing stock-out risk. Meanwhile, Pfizer\u2019s prior inventory write-offs indicate vulnerability to supply-demand mismatches, which would be exacerbated by production delays, leading to further inventory write-downs or shortages."

      "answer": "Amgen operates in a single business segment\u2014human therapeutics\u2014and therefore reports the financial performance of Enbrel as part of its consolidated results without separate segment disclosure. In contrast, Pfizer categorizes Enbrel under its Specialty Care segment, specifically within the Inflammation & Immunology subcategory, and provides segment-specific performance details. This means Pfizer's reporting allows stakeholders to assess Enbrel's contribution within a targeted therapeutic area, while Amgen's structure does not distinguish Enbrel's performance from its broader product portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Pfizer categorizes Enbrel under its Specialty Care segment, specifically within Inflammation & Immunology.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amgen's single-segment reporting integrates Enbrel's performance with all other products, whereas Pfizer's segmented approach isolates Enbrel's contribution within a specific therapeutic category, allowing for more granular financial analysis of the product."

      "question": "Amgen highlights that regulatory challenges could lead to stock-outs taking longer than five years to resolve, while Pfizer experienced a global recall of Chantix due to nitrosamine contamination. How do these disclosures reflect the differing operational risks each company faces in maintaining product supply, and what do they indicate about the complexity of their manufacturing strategies?",
      "answer": "Amgen notes that regulatory changes or manufacturing disruptions could result in stock-outs that may take over five years to resolve due to the lengthy process of validating new facilities or manufacturers. This indicates a high dependency on tightly controlled and approved manufacturing processes, which limits flexibility in responding to supply chain risks. Pfizer, on the other hand, experienced a real-world example of supply chain disruption when it recalled all lots of Chantix in the U.S. due to nitrosamine contamination, with international returns dependent on updated regulatory approvals expected in 2024. This demonstrates that while Amgen faces theoretical risks tied to regulatory inertia, Pfizer has faced tangible product supply interruptions due to evolving quality standards. Together, these examples highlight how complex pharmaceutical manufacturing strategies\u2014whether focused on regulatory compliance or quality control\u2014carry significant operational risks that can directly impact product availability and business continuity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen states that regulatory or manufacturing disruptions could result in stock-outs that may take longer than five years to resolve due to the time required to validate and license new manufacturing plants or contract manufacturers.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Pfizer voluntarily recalled all lots of Chantix in the U.S. due to nitrosamine contamination and is awaiting updated regulatory guidance to potentially reintroduce the product internationally in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amgen's risk is largely regulatory and forward-looking, highlighting the inflexibility of its manufacturing strategy, while Pfizer's risk materialized into a real supply chain disruption due to quality issues. This contrast shows how both companies face significant but distinct operational vulnerabilities in maintaining product supply."

      "question": "Which company currently markets Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada, and what does this indicate about their strategic positioning in the inflammation and immunology therapeutic area compared to the original manufacturer?",
      "answer": "Pfizer currently markets Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada, indicating that they have taken over commercialization of the drug in these regions. This suggests that Pfizer has assumed a key role in the global distribution of Enbrel, while Amgen, the original manufacturer, retains rights in the U.S. and Canada. This geographic division of rights allows both companies to leverage Enbrel\u2019s therapeutic value within their respective markets, supporting their strategic focus on inflammation and immunology.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, Pfizer markets Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada as part of its Inflammation & immunology portfolio.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, Amgen is the original producer of Enbrel, as it is listed among Amgen\u2019s product names, though the specific geographic rights are not detailed in this excerpt.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that while Amgen developed Enbrel, Pfizer now holds the rights to market it internationally, reflecting a strategic partnership or licensing agreement between the two companies."

      "question": "How does the risk of exclusion from government healthcare programs due to off-label marketing practices specifically impact both Amgen's and Danaher's financial and operational strategies, given their respective exposures outlined in their 2023 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Amgen faces potential exclusion from government healthcare programs due to its involvement in off-label marketing and prior settlements, such as the 2019 agreement with the DOJ and HHS-OIG, which included a corporate integrity agreement requiring compliance through April 2024. Failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs, directly affecting its U.S. market access and profitability. Similarly, Danaher\u2019s risk stems from its medical device business, where off-label promotion could trigger exclusion under FDA regulations, as noted in its discussion of regulatory risks and the potential for FDA Form 483 observations, warning letters, or loss of market access. Both companies have increased compliance costs and operational constraints embedded in their strategies to mitigate these risks. Amgen emphasizes maintaining a corporate compliance program, while Danaher invests in regulatory adherence and clinical trial validation to support approved product indications.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen's 2019 settlement with DOJ and HHS-OIG and the corporate integrity agreement through April 2024, with potential exclusion from government healthcare programs upon non-compliance.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Danaher's exposure to off-label marketing risks, including potential exclusion from government programs and regulatory actions such as FDA Form 483 or warning letters.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face exclusion risks due to off-label marketing, which directly affects their access to government-funded healthcare markets and necessitates increased compliance investments and operational adjustments."

      "question": "How does the regulatory framework under the FDCA impact both Amgen's biologic product development timelines and Danaher's medical device commercialization processes, and what specific delays or requirements are mentioned in their respective 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "The FDCA impacts both Amgen and Danaher by imposing regulatory requirements that directly affect their product development and commercialization timelines. Amgen faces delays due to patent litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act and BPCIA, particularly for products like Neulasta, where six biosimilar versions have been approved in the U.S., accelerating competitive pressure and sales decline. Danaher, on the other hand, must navigate the FDA\u2019s Section 510(k) clearance or PMA approval process for medical devices, which can significantly extend development timelines due to the requirement for extensive performance and clinical data to demonstrate substantial equivalence. Both companies are subject to the FDCA\u2019s regulatory oversight, but the nature of the impact differs based on their product types\u2014Amgen through biosimilar competition and litigation, and Danaher through premarket clearance requirements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen faces patent litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act and BPCIA, and six biosimilar versions of Neulasta have been approved in the U.S., accelerating competitive pressure.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Danaher must obtain Section 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for medical devices, which requires extensive data and can significantly extend development timelines.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to the FDCA, but the regulatory impact manifests differently: Amgen faces competitive and legal challenges due to biosimilar development pathways, while Danaher experiences development delays due to premarket clearance requirements."

The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA'). The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export and record keeping for such products. Many medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval ('PMA') before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is 'substantially equivalent' to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be 'substantially equivalent' to such a pre-1976 device. As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device's safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until the required 510(k) clearance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state and non-U.S. agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices ('CGMP') requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems Regulation ('QSR'), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting ('MDR') requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') (and similar regulators in other jurisdictions). Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as 'off-label' promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| In the European Union ('EU'), our products are subject to the medical device and in vitro medical device laws of the various member states, which for many years were based on Directives of the European Commission. However, in May 2017, the EU adopted new, formal regulations to replace such Directives; specifically, the EU Medical Device Regulation (the 'MDR') and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the 'IVDR'), each of which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and in vitro devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The EU regulations were adopted with staggered transitional periods that have since been updated. In March 2023, the European Commission issued an amended regulation to eliminate the previous 'selloff' periods and extend the original transitional compliance dates for both the MDR and IVDR regulations. The amended MDR and IVDR timelines for becoming fully effective are now from May 2026 to December 2028 for MDR devices and May 2026 to May 2028 for IVDR devices, depending on product classifications.

      "question": "How does the FDCA's regulatory framework, as referenced by both Amgen and Danaher, influence the time and cost required for Danaher to bring a new medical device to market in the U.S.?",
      "answer": "The FDCA, referenced by both Amgen and Danaher, imposes a rigorous regulatory process administered by the FDA that significantly affects the time and cost for Danaher to bring a new medical device to market. Danaher must either obtain a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval (PMA), depending on the device classification. The Section 510(k) process requires submission of performance and clinical data demonstrating substantial equivalence to a previously marketed device, which can extend the development timeline considerably. Additionally, any significant modifications to a cleared device may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, further increasing time and cost. Amgen\u2019s reference to the FDCA confirms its broad applicability across healthcare companies, reinforcing that both pharmaceutical and medical device firms must navigate the same regulatory landscape, which directly impacts product development timelines and financial investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amgen is subject to the FDCA, indicating its relevance to healthcare companies in general.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Danaher must comply with FDCA requirements, including Section 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, which involve extensive data submission and can significantly extend development timelines.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The FDCA\u2019s regulatory framework applies broadly to healthcare firms like Amgen and specifically dictates the costly and time-consuming approval process Danaher must follow for medical devices."

The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is 'substantially equivalent' to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be 'substantially equivalent' to such a pre-1976 device. As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device's safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until the required 510(k) clearance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state and non-U.S. agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices ('CGMP') requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems Regulation ('QSR'), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting ('MDR') requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') (and similar regulators in other jurisdictions). Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as 'off-label' promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| In the European Union ('EU'), our products are subject to the medical device and in vitro medical device laws of the various member states, which for many years were based on Directives of the European Commission. However, in May 2017, the EU adopted new, formal regulations to replace such Directives; specifically, the EU Medical Device Regulation (the 'MDR') and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the 'IVDR'), each of which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and in vitro devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The EU regulations were adopted with staggered transitional periods that have since been updated. In March 2023, the European Commission issued an amended regulation to eliminate the previous 'selloff' periods and extend the original transitional compliance dates for both the MDR and IVDR regulations. The amended MDR and IVDR timelines for becoming fully effective are now from May 2026 to December 2028 for MDR devices and May 2026 to May 2028 for IVDR devices, depending on product classifications.

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development\n\nR&amp;D is critical to our long-term competitiveness. We concentrate our R&amp;D efforts in the following disease areas with significant unmet medical needs: oncology, including IO; hematology and cell therapy, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia; immunology including relapsing multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease; cardiovascular, including cardiomyopathy, heart failure and thrombotic disorders; and fibrotic disease, specifically lung ('IPF') and liver ('NASH'). We also continue to analyze and may selectively pursue promising leads in other areas. Our R&amp;D pipeline includes potential medicines in various modalities including small (chemically manufactured) molecules and large (protein)  molecules-also  known  as  biologics-and  also  millamolecules,  antibody  drug  conjugates,  cellular  therapies  and  gene therapies.  In  addition  to  discovering  and  developing  new  molecular  entities,  we  look  for  ways  to  expand  the  value  of  existing products through new indications and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients.\n\nIn order for a new drug to reach the market, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S., the EU and most foreign countries  provide  for  the  determination  of  a  drug's  effectiveness  and  safety  through  preclinical  tests  and  controlled  clinical evaluation. The clinical development of a potential new drug typically includes Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical studies that have been designed specifically to support an application for regulatory approval for a particular indication, assuming the studies are successful.\n\nPhase I clinical studies involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety  and  proper  dosing.  Phase  II  clinical  studies  involve  a  larger  patient  population  to  investigate  side  effects,  efficacy  and optimal dosage of the drug candidate. Phase III clinical studies are conducted to confirm Phase II results in a significantly larger patient  population  over  a  longer  term  and  to  provide  reliable  and  conclusive  data  regarding  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  a  drug candidate. Although regulatory approval is typically based on the results of Phase III clinical studies, there are times when approval can be granted based on data from earlier studies.\n\nWe  consider  our  registrational  studies  to  be  our  significant  R&amp;D  programs.  These  programs  may  include  both  investigational compounds in Phases II and III development for initial indications, or marketed products that are in development for additional indications or formulations. Substantial components of our R&amp;D program strategy include expanding our portfolio of marketed products  in  hematology,  immunology  and  IO  as  well  as Opdivo in  combination  with Yervoy and  other  agents  in  both  first  and second-line therapy with new indications.\n\nDrug  development  is  time  consuming,  expensive  and  risky.  The  R&amp;D  process  typically  takes  about  fourteen  years,  with approximately two and a half years spent in Phase III, or late-stage, development. On average, only about one in 10,000 molecules discovered by pharmaceutical industry researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval. According to the KMR Group, based on industry success rates from 2016-2020, approximately 91% of small molecules that enter Phase I development fail to achieve regulatory approval. Small molecules that enter Phase II development have  a  failure  rate  of  approximately  79%  while  approximately  27%  of  Phase  III  or  later  stage  small  molecules  fail  to  achieve approval.  For  biologics,  the  failure  rate  is  approximately  89%  from  Phase  I  development,  approximately  73%  from  Phase  II development and approximately 30% from Phase III and later stage development.\n\nTotal  R&amp;D  expenses  include  the  costs  of  discovery  research,  preclinical  development,  early-stage  and  late-stage  clinical development,  drug  formulation,  post-commercialization  and  medical  support  of  marketed  products,  proportionate  allocations  of enterprise-wide  costs  and  up-front  and  contingent  milestone  payments  for  licensing  and  acquiring  assets.  R&amp;D  expenses  were $11.4  billion  in  2021,  $11.1  billion  in  2020  and  $6.1  billion  in  2019,  including  license  and  asset  acquisition  charges  of approximately $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $25 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. R&amp;D expenses in 2020 include a full year  of  expense  resulting  from  the  Celgene  acquisition  which  occurred  in  November  2019.  In  addition,  an  $11.4  billion  IPRD charge was recognized in 2020 for the MyoKardia acquisition.\n\nWe manage  our  R&amp;D  programs  on  a  product  portfolio  basis,  investing  resources  in  each  stage  of  R&amp;D  from  early  discovery through late-stage development. We continually evaluate our portfolio of R&amp;D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of  early-stage  and  late-stage  programs  to  support  the  future  growth  of  the  Company.  Spending  on  our  late-stage  development programs  represented  approximately  40%  of  our  annual  R&amp;D  expenses  in  2021. Opdivo is  the  only  individual  investigational compound or marketed product to represent 10% or more of our R&amp;D expenses in 2021.\n\nOur drug discovery and development work takes place across a network of state-of-the-art facilities worldwide. We have continued our  investment  in  our  existing  sites  and  the  expansion  of  our  manufacturing  capabilities.  For  example,  we  expanded  our Lawrenceville, New Jersey site in 2020 and are opening a new R&amp;D facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts (planned for 2023). In addition,  in  support  of  our  continued  investment  in  our  cell  therapy  portfolio,  we  are  expanding  our  manufacturing  capabilities through  the  construction  of  new  state-of-the-art  cell  therapy  manufacturing  facilities  in  Devens,  Massachusetts  and  Leiden, Netherlands.",

      "question": "How does the focus of late-stage R&D investment in immunology drugs at BMY compare to JNJ's portfolio allocation across its six therapeutic areas, including immunology, and what might this indicate about their respective strategic priorities in this domain?",
      "answer": "BMY allocated approximately 40% of its $11.4 billion R&D budget in 2021 to late-stage development programs, with a specific emphasis on expanding the value of existing products like Opdivo in immunology and other therapeutic areas. JNJ, on the other hand, includes immunology as one of six key therapeutic areas within its Pharmaceutical segment, indicating a more diversified approach. While BMY's focused investment suggests a strategic emphasis on advancing late-stage immunology and other high-potential therapies, JNJ's inclusion of immunology within a broader therapeutic portfolio implies a more balanced investment across multiple disease areas. This comparison highlights differing strategic priorities: BMY is concentrating resources in select areas with potential for near-term commercialization, while JNJ is spreading its efforts across a wider therapeutic landscape.",

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development\n\nR&amp;D is critical to our long-term competitiveness. We concentrate our R&amp;D efforts in the following disease areas with significant unmet medical needs: oncology, including IO; hematology and cell therapy, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia; immunology including relapsing multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease; cardiovascular, including cardiomyopathy, heart failure and thrombotic disorders; and fibrotic disease, specifically lung ('IPF') and liver ('NASH'). We also continue to analyze and may selectively pursue promising leads in other areas. Our R&amp;D pipeline includes potential medicines in various modalities including small (chemically manufactured) molecules and large (protein)  molecules-also  known  as  biologics-and  also  millamolecules,  antibody  drug  conjugates,  cellular  therapies  and  gene therapies.  In  addition  to  discovering  and  developing  new  molecular  entities,  we  look  for  ways  to  expand  the  value  of  existing products through new indications and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients.\n\nIn order for a new drug to reach the market, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S., the EU and most foreign countries  provide  for  the  determination  of  a  drug's  effectiveness  and  safety  through  preclinical  tests  and  controlled  clinical evaluation. The clinical development of a potential new drug typically includes Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical studies that have been designed specifically to support an application for regulatory approval for a particular indication, assuming the studies are successful.\n\nPhase I clinical studies involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety  and  proper  dosing.  Phase  II  clinical  studies  involve  a  larger  patient  population  to  investigate  side  effects,  efficacy  and optimal dosage of the drug candidate. Phase III clinical studies are conducted to confirm Phase II results in a significantly larger patient  population  over  a  longer  term  and  to  provide  reliable  and  conclusive  data  regarding  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  a  drug candidate. Although regulatory approval is typically based on the results of Phase III clinical studies, there are times when approval can be granted based on data from earlier studies.\n\nWe  consider  our  registrational  studies  to  be  our  significant  R&amp;D  programs.  These  programs  may  include  both  investigational compounds in Phases II and III development for initial indications, or marketed products that are in development for additional indications or formulations. Substantial components of our R&amp;D program strategy include expanding our portfolio of marketed products  in  hematology,  immunology  and  IO  as  well  as Opdivo in  combination  with Yervoy and  other  agents  in  both  first  and second-line therapy with new indications.\n\nDrug  development  is  time  consuming,  expensive  and  risky.  The  R&amp;D  process  typically  takes  about  fourteen  years,  with approximately two and a half years spent in Phase III, or late-stage, development. On average, only about one in 10,000 molecules discovered by pharmaceutical industry researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval. According to the KMR Group, based on industry success rates from 2016-2020, approximately 91% of small molecules that enter Phase I development fail to achieve regulatory approval. Small molecules that enter Phase II development have  a  failure  rate  of  approximately  79%  while  approximately  27%  of  Phase  III  or  later  stage  small  molecules  fail  to  achieve approval.  For  biologics,  the  failure  rate  is  approximately  89%  from  Phase  I  development,  approximately  73%  from  Phase  II development and approximately 30% from Phase III and later stage development.\n\nTotal  R&amp;D  expenses  include  the  costs  of  discovery  research,  preclinical  development,  early-stage  and  late-stage  clinical development,  drug  formulation,  post-commercialization  and  medical  support  of  marketed  products,  proportionate  allocations  of enterprise-wide  costs  and  up-front  and  contingent  milestone  payments  for  licensing  and  acquiring  assets.  R&amp;D  expenses  were $11.4  billion  in  2021,  $11.1  billion  in  2020  and  $6.1  billion  in  2019,  including  license  and  asset  acquisition  charges  of approximately $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $25 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. R&amp;D expenses in 2020 include a full year  of  expense  resulting  from  the  Celgene  acquisition  which  occurred  in  November  2019.  In  addition,  an  $11.4  billion  IPRD charge was recognized in 2020 for the MyoKardia acquisition.\n\nWe manage  our  R&amp;D  programs  on  a  product  portfolio  basis,  investing  resources  in  each  stage  of  R&amp;D  from  early  discovery through late-stage development. We continually evaluate our portfolio of R&amp;D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of  early-stage  and  late-stage  programs  to  support  the  future  growth  of  the  Company.  Spending  on  our  late-stage  development programs  represented  approximately  40%  of  our  annual  R&amp;D  expenses  in  2021. Opdivo is  the  only  individual  investigational compound or marketed product to represent 10% or more of our R&amp;D expenses in 2021.\n\nOur drug discovery and development work takes place across a network of state-of-the-art facilities worldwide. We have continued our  investment  in  our  existing  sites  and  the  expansion  of  our  manufacturing  capabilities.  For  example,  we  expanded  our Lawrenceville, New Jersey site in 2020 and are opening a new R&amp;D facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts (planned for 2023). In addition,  in  support  of  our  continued  investment  in  our  cell  therapy  portfolio,  we  are  expanding  our  manufacturing  capabilities through  the  construction  of  new  state-of-the-art  cell  therapy  manufacturing  facilities  in  Devens,  Massachusetts  and  Leiden, Netherlands.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\n\n## Description of the Company and Business Segments\n\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have",

Alliances may be structured as co-development, co-commercialization, licensing or joint venture arrangements. These arrangements may include up-front payments; option payments to develop or commercialize a specific asset or technology; payments for various developmental, regulatory and sales-based performance milestones; royalties; cost reimbursements; profit sharing; and equity investments. Provisions in our alliance arrangements lessen our investment risk for compounds not leading to revenue generating products but reduce the profitability of marketed products due to profit sharing or royalty payments. We actively pursue such arrangements and view alliances as an important complement to our own discovery, development and commercialization activities.\n\nOur  alliance  arrangements  contain  customary  early  termination  provisions  following  material  breaches,  bankruptcy  or  product safety concerns. Such arrangements also typically provide for termination by BMS without cause. The amount of notice required for early termination generally ranges from immediately upon notice to 180 days after receipt of notice. Termination immediately upon notice is generally available where the other party files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or if a material safety issue arises with a product such that the medical risk/benefit is incompatible with the welfare of patients to continue to develop or commercialize the product. Termination with a notice period is generally available where an involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed and has not been dismissed, a material breach by a party has occurred and not been cured or where BMS terminates without cause. Sometimes, BMS's right  to  terminate  without  cause  may  only  be  exercisable  after  a  specified  period  of  time  has  elapsed  after  the  alliance agreement is signed. Our alliances typically do not otherwise contain provisions that provide the other party the right to terminate the alliance.\n\nWe typically do not retain any rights to another party's product or intellectual property after an alliance terminates. The loss of rights to one or more products that are marketed and sold by us pursuant to an alliance could be material to our results of operations and  the  loss  of  cash  flows  caused  by  such  loss  of  rights  could  be  material  to  our  financial  condition  and  liquidity.  Alliance agreements may be structured to terminate on specific dates, upon the product's patent expiration date or without an expiry date. Profit sharing payments typically have no expiration date while royalty payments typically cease upon loss of market exclusivity, including patent expiration.\n\nRefer to 'Item 8.

Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management's assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as 'plans,' 'expects,' 'will,' 'anticipates,' 'estimates' and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company's Consumer Health business; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.\n\nBecause forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company's actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements.

Given the decision, the earliest that generic manufacturers are permitted to launch their apixaban products is April 1, 2028, subject to additional challenges.\n- Following the May 2021 expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Eliquis in  Europe, generic manufacturers may seek to market  generic  versions  of Eliquis in  Europe  prior  to  the  expiration  of  our  patents,  which  may  lead  to  additional, infringement and invalidity actions involving our Eliquis patents being filed in various countries in Europe. We believe in the  innovative  science  behind Eliquis and  the  strength  of  our  intellectual  property,  which  we  will  defend  against infringement.  Refer  to  'Item  1.

          "chunk_text": "In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson &amp; Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson &amp; Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson &amp; Johnson's shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was completed. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement the class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. Discovery is ongoing. \u00ae\n\nIn June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson &amp; Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. In February 2022, the Court granted Johnson &amp; Johnson's cross motion to dismiss. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson &amp; Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder, and that Johnson &amp; Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson &amp; Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company's Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues and demanding that suit be brought against certain Directors. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in the In re Johnson &amp; Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . The independent counsel recommended that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel's report. In October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In March 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery. The Court temporarily terminated Johnson &amp; Johnson's motion to dismiss pending a decision on Plaintiff's motion for discovery. In November 2021, at the Court's request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing on Plaintiff's motion for discovery. \u00ae\n\nIn January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson &amp; Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson &amp; Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson &amp; Johnson stock as a Johnson &amp; Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants' motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of October 2020, briefing on Defendants' motion was complete. In February 2021, the Court granted Defendants' motion, and granted Plaintiffs leave to amend. In April 2021, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they did not intend to file an amended complaint, and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. In May 2021, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Third Circuit. In July 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in the Third Circuit and in September 2021, Defendants filed their response brief, and in October 2021, Plaintiffs filed their reply brief. In January 2022, the Third Circuit heard oral argument. A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging violations of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON'S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson &amp; Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in the Company's favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its responsive brief in October 2021. In October 2021, Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit. A bankruptcy stay was imposed in December 2021, and the Court held the reply deadline in abeyance. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc matters, including from Senator Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice, the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, the Senate",

      "question": "How does AbbVie's development and regulatory progress with Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis compare to Amgen's broader product portfolio in 2024, and what does this imply about AbbVie's strategic focus in immunology?",
      "answer": "AbbVie made significant regulatory progress with Skyrizi in 2024, gaining FDA and European Commission approval for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. This indicates AbbVie's focused investment and development efforts in immunology, particularly in expanding Skyrizi's indications. In contrast, Amgen's 2024 filing references Skyrizi as part of a broad list of products owned by other companies, suggesting Amgen does not have a direct development or commercial stake in Skyrizi and instead maintains a diversified portfolio spanning multiple therapeutic areas. This contrast highlights AbbVie's strategic emphasis on immunology and biologics like Skyrizi as a core growth driver.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, AbbVie received FDA and EC approval for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis in June and July 2024, showing active development and regulatory investment in expanding its indications.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Amgen's 2024 filing lists Skyrizi as a trademarked product owned by another company, indicating Amgen does not develop or commercialize Skyrizi but includes it in a catalog of third-party products.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AbbVie's regulatory milestones with Skyrizi reflect a focused strategic push in immunology, while Amgen's mention of Skyrizi implies no direct involvement, underscoring AbbVie's ownership and prioritization of the drug."

      "answer": "Amgen faces direct competition from AbbVie's Skyrizi in the U.S. and Europe, which could negatively impact Amgen\u2019s market share and sales in immunology-related therapeutic areas. AbbVie's Skyrizi is listed as a competitor to Amgen\u2019s products, potentially affecting Amgen's competitive positioning. However, AbbVie itself faces significant risks in the development and sale of its biologics, including Skyrizi. For example, AbbVie highlights that the successful discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of biologics is a long, expensive, and uncertain process, and failure in any of these areas could negatively impact its business. If AbbVie encounters setbacks with Skyrizi\u2014such as manufacturing issues, supply chain disruptions, or intellectual property disputes\u2014Amgen could benefit through reduced competitive pressure. Conversely, if Skyrizi performs well, Amgen may face increased competition, which could reduce its revenue and market share in these regions.",

          "chunk_text": "## A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products.\n\nAbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. Such disputes could result in AbbVie's loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of AbbVie's commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.\n\n## Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\nThe successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and current governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. As a result, manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics-including Humira, Skyrizi, Botox and Creon -could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\n## New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.\n\nAbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that research, develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie's products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. In addition, as AbbVie products lose exclusivity, competition surrounding such products will increase and generic and biosimilar products will increasingly penetrate the markets. Furthermore, consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, have lower prices or better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, or have superior performance features than AbbVie's products, and this may negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\n## The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process requiring critical environmental controls, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer.\n\nThe manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, labor shortages, supply chain disruption, pandemics, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, such batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, ti me and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\n\n17\n\n",

      "question": "How does Amgen's identification of Skyrizi as a competitor product in the U.S. and Europe affect AbbVie's strategic positioning of Skyrizi in the IL-23 inhibitor market for autoimmune diseases?",
      "answer": "Amgen explicitly identifies Skyrizi as a competitor-marketed product in the U.S. and Europe, indicating direct competitive pressure in the IL-23 inhibitor space. AbbVie positions Skyrizi as a biologic therapy targeting autoimmune diseases in North America, the European Union, and Japan, which overlaps with the territories where Amgen reports competition. This suggests AbbVie must differentiate Skyrizi in a market where Amgen's products, such as ENBREL and other biologics, are competing for market share. The competitive dynamic implies AbbVie may need to emphasize Skyrizi\u2019s therapeutic specificity, such as its selective IL-23 p19 subunit targeting, to maintain or grow its position in these key markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AbbVie positions Skyrizi as an IL-23 inhibitor targeting autoimmune diseases in North America, the EU, and Japan.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Amgen lists Skyrizi as a competitor-marketed product in the U.S. and Europe, indicating competitive pressure in those regions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The overlap in geographic markets and therapeutic focus creates direct competition, requiring AbbVie to strategically position Skyrizi to maintain market share against Amgen and other competitors."

      "answer": "AbbVie's 10-K filing reveals a research collaboration with Baxter focused on the development of BAX 111, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This program was in the early stages of clinical development as of 2024. In contrast, Amgen's partnership with Baxter, as disclosed in its 10-K filing, centers on the development and commercialization of a biosimilar candidate, AMG 117, which targets inflammatory diseases and was in Phase III clinical trials at the time of reporting. Thus, Baxter's collaboration with AbbVie is earlier stage and focused on neurology, while its work with Amgen is further along and focused on biosimilars for inflammation.",

      "answer": "Abbott (ABT) notes that compliance with healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including federal anti-kickback statutes, is costly and materially affects its business, requiring significant technical expertise and investment. UnitedHealthcare Community & State, which manages Medicaid contracts for over 7.4 million people as of December 31, 2024, is also subject to these same anti-kickback laws, increasing the complexity and cost of managing those contracts. The shared regulatory burden under anti-kickback laws means both companies must invest heavily in compliance infrastructure, audits, and risk management to avoid enforcement actions, fines, or loss of billing or contract privileges. This regulatory overlap amplifies the financial and operational burden for both entities, particularly given UnitedHealthcare\u2019s large Medicaid footprint and Abbott\u2019s product approval and marketing processes.",

G overnment regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott's products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, postmarket changes to products, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott's laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require Abbott's laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.\n\nAbbott's international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott's investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.\n\nAbbott's laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement or payment to third-party payors, including government agencies such as Medicare and Medicaid, or governments. In the United States, these entities may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.\n\nAbbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott's business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In V itro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory  requirements  can  result  in  sanctions,  including  suspension,  revocation,  or  limitation  of  a  laboratory's  certification,  which  is  necessary  to  conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.\n\nAbbott's business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of healthcare products and their components that are  regularly  conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others.  These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.",

CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts, which are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex.\n\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services, anti-money laundering and securities and antitrust compliance.\n\nPrivacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation.

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group faces a more significant potential financial constraint on operations due to its deep involvement in government healthcare programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, which are directly tied to compliance with Anti-Kickback Laws and subject to extensive audits and regulatory oversight. Abbott also faces financial risks from Anti-Kickback Law violations, which could result in criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and exclusion from government healthcare programs.

Abbott\u2019s exposure, while serious, is more operational and tied to product recalls and consent decrees, such as the 2022 infant formula recall and FDA consent decree, which impacted cash flows but did not fundamentally threaten its market access.",

Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## It  is  costly  for  Abbott  to  comply  with  numerous  governmental  regulations  and  to  develop  compliant  products  and  processes,  and  consequences  for  noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nAbbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\n\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval, clearance, or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, postmarket changes to products, advertising, and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott's products, and civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.\n\nThese actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy any actual or potential issues; the inability to obtain future product approvals, clearances, or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For example, in  February 2022, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan at which time it temporarily stopped manufacturing at the facility. In May 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the FDA. For information on the impact of Abbott's voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage, see the discussion in the 'Financial Review' section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.\n\n## Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\n\nAbbott's  industry  is  subject  to  various  international,  supranational,  federal,  and  state  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to  government  benefit  program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. V iolations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and V eterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices.

      "question": "How do federal anti-kickback laws specifically affect the financial and operational risks of UnitedHealth Group's Optum Rx pharmacy benefit management services and Abbott Laboratories' healthcare product commercialization, based on their respective disclosures?",
      "answer": "Federal anti-kickback laws significantly shape the financial and operational risks for both UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT), albeit through different mechanisms. For UNH, the Optum Rx pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business is directly subject to anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement, and rebate disclosure laws governing its relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacies, and consumers. These regulatory risks include potential civil penalties, corporate integrity agreements, and changes to the PBM business model, which could materially affect Optum Rx's revenue and profitability. For ABT, anti-kickback and false claims laws apply to its healthcare product commercialization, including its laboratories and durable medical equipment suppliers that submit claims to Medicare and Medicaid. Noncompliance could result in sanctions such as billing privilege revocation, product seizures, or criminal penalties, which would directly impact Abbott\u2019s revenue and market access. Both companies must invest heavily in compliance infrastructure to mitigate these risks, with UNH also facing retrospective payment adjustments from CMS audits and ABT facing delays or enforcement actions that could halt product sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Abbott is subject to federal anti-kickback and false claims laws that apply to its laboratories and healthcare product suppliers submitting claims to Medicare and Medicaid. Noncompliance could result in billing privilege revocation, product seizures, or criminal penalties.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Optum Rx PBM business is subject to anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement, and rebate disclosure laws. Investigations or audits could result in civil penalties, corporate integrity agreements, or business model changes.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face operational and financial risks from anti-kickback laws, but through different channels: Abbott through product commercialization and government claims submission, and UnitedHealth through PBM relationships and rebate structures. Both must invest in compliance and face potential revenue impacts from enforcement actions."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar national and international regulatory agencies. G overnment regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott's products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, postmarket changes to products, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott's laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require Abbott's laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.\n\nAbbott's international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott's investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.\n\nAbbott's laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement or payment to third-party payors, including government agencies such as Medicare and Medicaid, or governments. In the United States, these entities may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.\n\nAbbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott's business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In V itro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory  requirements  can  result  in  sanctions,  including  suspension,  revocation,  or  limitation  of  a  laboratory's  certification,  which  is  necessary  to  conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.\n\nAbbott's business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of healthcare products and their components that are  regularly  conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others.  These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.",

UnitedHealth Group, on the other hand, faces financial exposure through retrospective payment adjustments, RADV audits, and potential civil or criminal penalties stemming from its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, particularly through Optum Rx, which is subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws governing relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and providers.

Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## It  is  costly  for  Abbott  to  comply  with  numerous  governmental  regulations  and  to  develop  compliant  products  and  processes,  and  consequences  for  noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nAbbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\n\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval, clearance, or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, postmarket changes to products, advertising, and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott's products, and civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.\n\nThese actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy any actual or potential issues; the inability to obtain future product approvals, clearances, or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For example, in  February 2022, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan at which time it temporarily stopped manufacturing at the facility. In May 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the FDA. For information on the impact of Abbott's voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage, see the discussion in the 'Financial Review' section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.\n\n## Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\n\nAbbott's  industry  is  subject  to  various  international,  supranational,  federal,  and  state  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to  government  benefit  program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. V iolations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and V eterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices.

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson discloses that patent expirations are followed by the introduction of competing generic and biosimilar products, which leads to significant revenue and market share losses. Additionally, increasing challenges to its patents may result in earlier-than-expected loss of market exclusivity and a rapid decline in sales. Merck similarly states that when its products lose market exclusivity, it generally experiences a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products. However, Merck emphasizes its dependence on key products for profits and cash flows, making the impact of exclusivity loss even more critical to its financial stability. Therefore, while both companies face revenue declines due to market exclusivity loss, Merck's financial exposure appears more acute due to its reliance on a narrower set of high-performing products.",

Management and representatives of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management's assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as 'plans,' 'expects,' 'will,' 'anticipates,' 'estimates' and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company's Consumer Health business; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.\n\nBecause forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company's actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\n## Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition\n\n- Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company's continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;\n- Challenges to the Company's ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;\n- The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;\n- Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company's patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;\n- Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;\n- Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;\n- Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and\n- Allegations that the Company's products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.\n\n## Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity\n\n- Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;\n- The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;",

      "answer": "The loss of market exclusivity for Merck's Januvia and Janumet in key markets\u2014U.S. in 2023, EU and China in 2022\u2014leads to anticipated substantial sales declines for Merck due to generic competition. This aligns with Johnson & Johnson's stated risk in its 2022 10-K that patent expirations and loss of market exclusivity typically result in revenue and market share losses, as competitors launch generic or biosimilar products. Furthermore, J&J notes that increasing challenges to patents and receptivity by courts and regulatory bodies to those challenges can lead to earlier-than-expected market exclusivity loss. Therefore, Merck\u2019s experience exemplifies the competitive and financial risk J&J explicitly warns about, reinforcing the real-world applicability of J&J\u2019s forward-looking caution about market exclusivity loss and competitive pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - J&J identifies loss of market exclusivity and patent challenges as a key risk, leading to revenue loss and decline in market share due to generic competition.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Merck\u2019s specific case illustrates the risk J&J warns about, showing how loss of exclusivity leads to generic competition and revenue decline, validating J&J\u2019s stated competitive risk."

      "question": "How does the joint commercialization arrangement between Pfizer and Astellas for Padcev differ from Merck's collaboration with Astellas on the Keytruda-Padcev combination in the treatment of urothelial cancer?",
      "answer": "Pfizer and Astellas jointly commercialize Padcev with equal sharing of profits and costs in the U.S., and a profit-sharing mechanism and royalty system outside the U.S. Merck collaborated with Astellas (and Seagen, now part of Pfizer) on the KEYNOTE-A39 trial that led to Keytruda's full FDA approval in combination with Padcev for urothelial cancer, but Merck does not share in Padcev's commercialization profits or costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Merck's Keytruda received FDA full approval in December 2023 in combination with Padcev for treating urothelial cancer, based on the KEYNOTE-A39 trial conducted with Seagen (now Pfizer) and Astellas.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Pfizer and Astellas have a joint commercialization arrangement for Padcev, with equal sharing of U.S. profits and costs, and a profit-sharing mechanism and royalty system outside the U.S.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While Merck collaborated with Astellas (and Seagen/Pfizer) on clinical development leading to FDA approval of Keytruda with Padcev, Merck does not share in the commercialization profits or costs of Padcev, unlike Pfizer's arrangement with Astellas."

      "question": "How much revenue from the Bavencio royalty agreement with Merck KGaA after June 30, 2023, is Pfizer entitled to, and how does this financial arrangement contrast with Merck KGaA's ongoing litigation with Merck (MRK) over brand rights in the U.S.?",
      "answer": "Pfizer is entitled to a 15% royalty on net sales of Bavencio beginning in the third quarter of 2023 after Merck KGaA assumed full control of the drug's global commercialization. This contrasts with Merck KGaA's ongoing litigation with Merck (MRK) in the U.S., where MRK filed a lawsuit in January 2016 to protect its brand rights, alleging that Merck KGaA improperly uses the name 'Merck' in the U.S., while Merck KGaA has filed suits in other jurisdictions alleging unfair competition and trademark infringement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - In March 2023, Pfizer and Merck KGaA terminated their alliance for Bavencio, and beginning in Q3 2023, Pfizer receives a 15% royalty on net sales of Bavencio.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - In January 2016, Merck (MRK) filed a lawsuit against Merck KGaA in the U.S. alleging improper use of the name 'Merck' and trademark infringement, while Merck KGaA has filed suits in other jurisdictions alleging unfair competition and breach of a coexistence agreement.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The financial arrangement between Pfizer and Merck KGaA is a cooperative post-termination royalty agreement, while the relationship between Merck (MRK) and Merck KGaA is adversarial, involving ongoing litigation over brand rights and trademark usage in the U.S. and other jurisdictions."

Pfizer's 2023 10-K filing confirms that it is developing drug candidates in collaboration with Astellas and also mentions a separate collaboration with Seagen.

      "answer": "Danaher (DHR) faces potential financial penalties from compliance violations that include fines, civil penalties, injunctions, consent decrees, operating restrictions, loss of regulatory approvals, reputational harm, and other monetary penalties. These risks are tied to violations of import/export laws, sanctions regulations, and government contract compliance failures, which could result in significant financial exposure. Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) has incurred substantial legal defense costs from multiple patent infringement lawsuits related to Comirnaty, including actions brought by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, ModernaTX, and Arbutus Biopharma, each of which involves claims for unspecified monetary damages. While DHR highlights the risk of financial penalties from regulatory noncompliance, PFE provides concrete evidence of legal costs already incurred through active litigation, indicating a shift from risk disclosure to real financial impact.",

Compliance with the v arious import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inv entory. In addition, we sell and prov ide products and technology to third parties, such as agents, representativ es and distributors, who may export such items to end-users. If we or any of these third parties do not comply with applicable export or import laws we may incur liability. In addition, from time to time, certain of our subsidiaries hav e limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensiv e sanctions. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated rev enues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of v iolating applicable sanctions regulations. We hav e established policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with such laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures hav e prev ented and will prev ent v iolations of these regulations, and any such v iolation can adv ersely affect our business and financial statements.\n- We also have agreements to sell products and serv ices to gov ernment entities as well as agreements relating to gov ernment financing, as discussed above (less than 5% of our 2024 sales were made to the U.S. federal gov ernment). The laws gov erning gov ernment contracts differ from the laws gov erning priv ate contracts; for example, our gov ernment contracts are in some cases subject to termination, reduction or modification at the conv enience of the gov ernment or in the ev ent of changes in gov ernment requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. Gov ernment contracts that hav e been awarded to us following a bid process can become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to inv estigation and audit for compliance with the requirements gov erning government contracts.\n\nThese are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to hav e tended to become more stringent ov er time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representativ es and the industries in which we operate are at times under rev iew and/or inv estigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceiv ed failure to comply) with the regulations referenced abov e or any other regulations can result in import detentions, fines, damages, civ il and administrativ e penalties, injunctions, consent decrees, suspensions or losses of regulatory approv als, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the gov ernment to approv e product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, disbarment from selling to certain gov ernmental agencies or exclusion from gov ernment funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity ov ersight and reporting obligations to resolv e allegations of non-compliance, disruption of our business, limitation on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and serv ices, loss of customers, significant legal and inv estigatory fees, disgorgement, indiv idual imprisonment, reputational harm, contractual damages, diminished profits, curtailment or restricting of business operations, criminal prosecution and other monetary and non-monetary penalties. Compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on inv estment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and serv ices and otherwise adv ersely impact our business and financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to 'Item 1. Business-Regulatory Matters.'\n\n## We are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nWe are subject to or otherwise responsible for a v ariety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business (or related to the business operations of prev iously owned entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or serv ices and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, breach of contract claims, competition and sales and trading practices, env ironmental matters, personal injury, insurance cov erage, securities matters, fiduciary duties and acquisition or div estiture-related matters, as well as regulatory subpoenas, requests for information, inv estigations and enforcement. We also from time to time become subject to lawsuits as a result of acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities prov ided in connection with, businesses div ested by us or our predecessors. The types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitiv e and consequential damages (and in some cases, treble damages) and/or injunctiv e relief. The defense of these lawsuits can div ert our management's attention, we from time to time incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we can be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that adv ersely affect our business and financial statements. Moreov er, any insurance or indemnification rights that we hav e may be insufficient or unav ailable to protect us against such losses. Because most contingencies are resolv ed ov er long periods of time, new dev elopments (including litigation dev elopments, the discov ery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in the Company's strategy in any giv en period can require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets prev iously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments.

      "question": "What specific financial reporting obligations and compliance risks related to the Civil Monetary Penalties Law are disclosed by both DHR and PFE, and how do these obligations differ in scope based on the nature of each company's healthcare product portfolios?",
      "answer": "Both DHR and PFE are subject to the Civil Monetary Penalties Law due to their involvement in the healthcare industry, but the scope of their obligations and risks differ based on the nature of their product portfolios. DHR, which sells in vitro diagnostic drugs-of-abuse assays and reagents containing small amounts of controlled substances, faces periodic DEA inspections and must ensure that any remuneration provided to healthcare providers does not improperly influence Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary choices. Additionally, DHR is required to report payments and transfers of value to healthcare providers under the Open Payments Act, which is tied to the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. PFE, as a biopharmaceutical company marketing drugs and biologics, must comply with broader marketing and sales regulations under the same law, including prohibitions on offering remuneration that could influence prescribing behavior for products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. These obligations are tied to PFE's need to report specific pricing data and offer discounts under programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the 340B Program, with potential financial penalties for inaccurate reporting. The financial risk for PFE is more directly tied to rebate calculations and pricing disclosures, while DHR's risk is more focused on transparency of provider interactions and controlled substance compliance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (DHR) - DHR discloses that its subsidiaries sell in vitro diagnostic drugs-of-abuse assays and reagents containing small amounts of controlled substances, which subjects them to DEA inspections and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. Additionally, DHR must comply with the Open Payments Act, requiring reporting of payments and transfers of value to healthcare providers.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (PFE) - PFE discloses that it is subject to the Civil Monetary Penalties Law in the context of marketing and sales regulations, including obligations to report pricing data and offer discounts under Medicare, Medicaid, and the 340B Program. PFE also notes the financial risk associated with inaccurate reporting and potential enforcement measures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, but the nature of their obligations differs based on their product portfolios. DHR's obligations are more focused on transparency in provider interactions and DEA compliance, while PFE's obligations are tied to pricing disclosures and rebate programs, with a broader regulatory scope due to its biopharmaceutical product lines."

          "chunk_text": "- The federal Civ il Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or serv ices.\n- The Open Payments Act requires manufacturers of medical dev ices cov ered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (subject to certain exceptions) to record payments and other transfers of v alue to a broad range of healthcare prov iders and teaching hospitals and to report this data as well as ownership and inv estment interests held by the physicians described abov e and their immediate family members to HHS for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements hav e also been enacted on the state lev el, and an increasing number of countries either hav e adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.\n\nIn addition, some of the in v itro diagnostic drugs-of-abuse assays and reagents sold by the Company's subsidiaries contain small amounts of controlled substances, and as a result some of the Company's facilities are inspected periodically by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to assess whether the Company properly handles, stores and disposes of controlled substances in the manufacture of those products.\n\nFederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activ ities and activ ities that potentially harm consumers. Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims inv olv ing healthcare items or serv ices reimbursed by any third-party payor, including priv ate insurers. Further, there are state laws that require medical dev ice manufacturers to comply with the v oluntary compliance guidelines and the relev ant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal gov ernment, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare prov iders and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of v alue prov ided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representativ es; and state laws gov erning the priv acy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\n\nFor a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Healthcare Reform\n\nIn the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, there hav e been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislativ e and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in the United States, in March 2010, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act) (collectiv ely, the 'PPACA') was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both gov ernmental and priv ate insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry. Since its enactment, there hav e been judicial, Congressional and executiv e challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future.\n\nMoreover, there has recently been heightened gov ernmental scrutiny ov er the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in sev eral Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, rev iew the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform gov ernment program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Indiv idual states in the U.S. hav e also become increasingly activ e in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Other countries, including China, hav e also introduced similar measures with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improv ing quality and/or expanding access.\n\n## Data Privacy and Security Law s\n\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data priv acy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of hav ing access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitiv e data in the course of our business. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') imposes significant restrictions on how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to superv isory authorities with significant fines for non-compliance. In the U.S., HIPAA priv acy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the av ailability and confidentiality of patient health information, indiv idual states regulate data breach and security requirements, and multiple gov ernmental bodies assert authority ov er aspects of the protection of personal priv acy. State priv acy laws in California impose some of the same features as the GDPR and hav e prompted an",

T he F D A, pursuant to the F F D C A, the P ublic H ealth Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, extensively regulates pre- and postmarketing activities related to our biopharm aceutical products and devices. T he statutes and regulations govern areas such as safety and efficacy, clinical trials, advertising and prom otion, quality control, m anufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-m arketing safety surveillance and reporting, and record keeping. O ther U .S. federal agencies, including the D E A, may also regulate certain of our products and activities.\n\nFor a biopharm aceutical com pany to m arket a drug or a biologic product, including vaccines, the F D A m ust evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use. Absent statutory exclusivity for a com peting product, if the F D A determ ines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective, the F D A generally will approve the product's N D A or BLA (or supplem ental N D A or supplem ental BLA), as appropriate.\n\nA drug or biologic m ay be subject to post m arketing com m itm ents, which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct, or post m arketing requirem ents, which are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and com ply with cG M P s (the F D A regulations that govern all aspects of m anufacturing quality for pharm aceuticals) and the D rug Supply C hain Security Act (the law that, am ong other things, sets forth requirem ents related to product tracing, product identifiers and verification for m anufacturers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, re-packagers and dispensers to facilitate the tracing of product through the pharm aceutical distribution supply chain), as well as advertising and prom otion regulations. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Development, Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products and Post-Authorization/Approval Data sections.\n\nWe are also responsible for m onitoring, reviewing, and the periodic reporting of adverse drug experience, or pharm acovigilance, including inform ation received from  any source, such as com m ercial m arketing experience, postm arketing clinical investigations, postm arketing epidem iological or surveillance studies, reports in the scientific literature, and unpublished scientific papers.\n\nI n the context of public health em ergencies, like the C O VID -19 pandem ic, we m ay apply to the F D A for an E U A which, if granted, allows for the distribution and use of our products during the declared em ergency, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the E U A, unless the E U A is term inated by the governm ent. Although the criteria for an E U A differ from the criteria for approval of an N D A or BLA, E U As nevertheless require the developm ent and subm ission of data to satisfy the relevant F D A standards, and a num ber of ongoing obligations. T he F D A generally expects E U A holders to work toward subm ission of full applications, such as a BLA or an N D A, as soon as possible.\n\nBiosimilar Regulation. The FD A is responsible for approval of biosim ilars. Innovator biologics, or reference products, are entitled to certain exclusivity periods. Applications for biosim ilars m ay not be subm itted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed and m ay not be approved until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed.\n\nSales and Marketing Regulations . Our m arketing practices are subject to federal and state laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), C ivil M onetary P enalties Law and F alse Claim s Act, intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. T hese laws can apply to both our direct-to-consum er m arketing practices as well as our m arketing to clinicians and healthcare facilities. T he AKS prohibits soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business that m ay be paid for, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program . T he C ivil M onetary P enalties Law covers a variety of conduct, often violations under other laws, and includes penalties for AKS violations as well as causing the subm ission of false claim s. T he F alse C laim s Act generally prohibits anyone from  knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claim s for paym ent for goods or services, including to governm ent payors, such as M edicare and M edicaid, that are false or fraudulent including false certifications of com pliance with applicable law. The federal governm ent and states also regulate sales and m arketing activities and financial interactions between m anufacturers and healthcare providers and academ ic m edical centers, requiring disclosure to governm ent authorities and the public of such interactions, and the adoption of com pliance standards or program s. State attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the m arketing of prescription drugs under state consum er protection and false advertising laws.\n\nPricing, Reimbursement and Access Regulations. P ricing and reim bursem ent for our products depend in part on governm ent regulation. Any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to reform  the healthcare system  by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or to expand controls on drug pricing, governm ent reim bursem ent, and access to medicines and vaccines on public and private insurance plans could have a m aterial im pact on us.\n\nWe must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharm aceutical products under various governm ent program s including M edicare, M edicaid, the Veterans Adm inistration and the 340B P rogram . W e also m ust report specific prices to state and federal governm ent agencies. T he calculations necessary to determ ine the prices reported are com plex and the failure to do so accurately m ay expose us to enforcem ent m easures.

PFE, on the other hand, values its partnership and other investments based on year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments for lagged reporting of up to three months, which introduces risks related to delayed reporting and reliance on fund administrators' valuation models.

Management believ es the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relev ant tax laws and does not expect the resolution of these matters to hav e a future material adv erse impact to the Company's financial statements, including its cash flows and effectiv e tax rate. Howev er, the outcome of these audits is uncertain.\n\nAn increase of 1.0% in the Company's 2024 nominal tax rate would hav e resulted in an additional income tax prov ision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $46 million.\n\nValuation of Inv estments in Equity Securities-For a description of the Company's inv estments in equity securities and partnerships refer to Notes 1, 8 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company inv ests in publicly-traded securities, non-marketable securities of early-stage companies and equity method inv estments, including partnerships that inv est primarily in early-stage companies.\n\nInv estments in early-stage companies hav e significant risks, including uncertainty regarding the inv estee company's ability to successfully dev elop new technologies and serv ices, bring these new technologies and serv ices to market and gain market acceptance, maintain adequate capitalization and access to cash or other forms of liquidity, and retain critical management personnel. Refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for a further discussion of the risks related to inv esting in early-stage companies.\n\nThe Company's investments in publicly traded securities are measured at fair v alue based on quotes in activ e markets. For inv estments in nonmarketable equity securities where the Company does not hav e influence ov er the inv estee, the Company has elected the measurement alternativ e and records these inv estments at cost and adjusts the carrying v alue for impairments and observ able price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the securities, if applicable. Valuations of non-marketable equity securities are complex and require judgment due to the absence of market prices, lack of liquidity and the risks inherent in early-stage companies. The uncertainty in the process of v aluing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated v alues of these securities to differ significantly from the v alues that would hav e been deriv ed had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material.\n\nThe Company accounts for its inv estments in the partnerships using the equity method. Accordingly, the inv estments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the partnership's income or loss and distributions receiv ed. The partnerships' inv estments are recorded by the partnerships on an estimated fair v alue basis and pose the same risks and require the same v aluation judgments discussed abov e. As a result, changes in the v alue of inv estments in the partnership will hav e a direct impact on the Company's earnings. Impairment losses for the partnerships are recognized to reduce the inv estment's carrying v alue to its fair v alue if there is a decline in fair v alue below carrying v alue that is considered to be otherthan-temporary. To determine whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment, the Company uses qualitativ e and quantitativ e v aluation methods.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses for these inv estments in equity securities and partnerships are recorded in other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. A 10% decrease in the carrying v alue of the Company's inv estments in equity securities and partnerships as of December 31, 2024 would result in a loss of approximately $156 million.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThe information required by this item is included under 'Item 7.

      "answer": "DHR faces financial and operational risks from clinical trial delays due to its reliance on trial outcomes to secure regulatory approvals for new products and indications. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data could hinder DHR's ability to obtain product approvals, impacting its market share and financial performance. Additionally, adverse clinical trial results involving customer products that use DHR's services could reduce future demand for those services, compounding the financial impact. On the other hand, PFE's product development timelines and pipeline progress are closely tied to third-party collaborators, including contract research organizations that manage regulatory filings and monitor trial performance. Delays caused by these partners failing to meet obligations or facing disruptions\u2014such as raw material shortages or cyber-attacks\u2014could delay PFE's regulatory submissions and commercialization efforts, directly affecting its revenue streams. Both companies face significant exposure from clinical trial delays, with DHR's risk centered on regulatory outcomes and market perception, while PFE's risk stems from collaboration dependencies and external supply chain vulnerabilities, each influencing their competitive positioning in the healthcare sector.",

Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator's or market perception of these clinical data, can adv ersely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements. In addition, our products and serv ices may support or be used in connection with customer products that are subject to clinical trials, and adv erse results in any such clinical trials may adversely affect future demand for our products and serv ices.\n\n## Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.\n\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about approv ed or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receiv e only permit us to market our products for the intended uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA or any other regulator determines that we hav e marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adv erse effects referenced under the risk factors set forth abov e. Any of these ev ents could significantly harm our business and financial statements.\n\n## Certain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.\n\nOnce a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the United States pursuant to a 510(k) clearance or a premarket approv al ('PMA'), a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the dev ice (similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions). Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may rev iew any manufacturer's decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We hav e made modifications to our products in the past and hav e determined based on our rev iew of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believ e do not require a new clearance or approv al. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civ il and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.\n\n## Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nOur operations, products and serv ices are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. env ironmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the env ironment, inv estigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at v arious sites, chemical constituents in products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for products sold. There can be no assurance that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) hav e been or will at all times be effectiv e.

In addition, there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future env ironmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adv ersely affect our business or financial statements.\n\nIn addition, we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged env ironmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by priv ate parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances.

Further, our revenues will be adversely affected by the term ination or expiration of collaboration and co-prom otion agreem ents that we have entered into and that we m ay enter into from  tim e to tim e.\n\n## COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS\n\nOur reputation, in-line and pipeline portfolios render our m edicines and vaccines prim e targets for counterfeiters. C ounterfeits pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are m anufactured-often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected, and unsanitary sites-as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to m itigate this threat could adversely im pact consum ers who use our products, potentially causing them  harm . T his situation, in turn, m ay result in the loss of patient confidence in the P fizer nam e and in the integrity of our m edicines and vaccines, and potentially im pact our business through lost sales, product recalls, and possible litigation. T he prevalence of counterfeit m edicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-com m erce. As consum ers increasingly turn to the internet as a source for m any products including m edicines, they are at the sam e tim e increasingly exposed to fake m edicines via the internet as crim inals increasingly distribute counterfeit and substandard m edicines through 'rogue' online pharm acies. The internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scam s that target unsuspecting consum ers. Traffic to these generally deceptive pharm acy sites is largely driven by m isplaced trust in sophisticated internet retailers and social m edia offers coupled with the convenience e-com m erce affords consum ers. C ounterfeiters generally target any m edicine or vaccine boasting strong dem and and we have observed heightened counterfeit and fraud attem pts to our internal m edicine portfolio, as well as products utilized in the treatm ent of C O VID -19.\n\nWe consistently invest in an enterprise-wide strategy to aggressively com bat counterfeit threats by educating patients and healthcare providers about the risks, investing in innovative technologies to detect and disrupt sophisticated internet offers and scam s, proactively m onitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcem ent, and advising legislators and regulators. H owever, our efforts and those of others m ay not be entirely successful, and the presence of counterfeit m edicines m ay continue to increase.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO G OVERNMENT REG ULATION AND LEG AL PROCEEDING S:\n\n## PRICING AND RE IMB U R SE ME N T\n\nOur future results could be adversely affected by changes in U .S. and international governm ental regulations that m andate price controls, create coverage criteria, or lim it patient access to our products. In addition to the expansion of price controls in the U .S. in the IR A, the adoption of m ore restrictive coverage policies and price controls in new and existing jurisdictions, or the failure to obtain or m aintain coverage and pricing could also adversely im pact revenue. W e expect pricing pressures and other cost containm ent m easures for drugs and vaccines will continue.\n\nI n the U .S., pharm aceutical product pricing is subject to governm ent and public scrutiny and calls for reform , and m any of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a result. W e expect to see continued focus by the U .S. governm ent on regulating pricing and access to m edicine. F or exam ple, the drug pricing provisions of the IR A are being im plem ented over the next several years. T he IR A directs H H S to set the prices of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under M edicare. T he IR A also im poses rebates under M edicare P art B and M edicare P art D  which require m anufacturers to pay rebates if price increases outpace inflation relative to a benchm ark period, and replaces the M edicare P art D  coverage gap discount program  with a new discounting program . T he drug pricing provisions of the IR A began to be im plem ented in 2022 and im plem entation efforts will continue in com ing years. In August 2023, C M S published the first ten m edicines subject to the M D P N P , which included E liquis. In August 2024, the governm ent released the new M edicare price for E liquis, which will becom e effective January 1, 2026. O n January 17, 2025, C M S announced the selection of another 15 drugs from Medicare P art D  for the m axim um  fair price, with prices to be set and effective on January 1, 2027. Ibrance and Xtandi were included in the list of 15 drugs selected. Another 15 drugs from  M edicare P art B or M edicare P art D  will be selected by F ebruary 1, 2026, for the m axim um  price to be set and in effect by January 1, 2028. It is possible that m ore of our products could be selected in future years, which could, am ong other things, lead to lower revenues prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. H ealth plans m ay also require rebates in addition to the m axim um  fair price for preferred placem ent on a M edicare plan form ulary. T he M D P N P  is currently subject to legal challenges and therefore, the outcom e rem ains uncertain. W e continue to evaluate the im pact of the IR A on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IR A on our business and the pharm aceutical industry rem ains uncertain. F or additional inform ation, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.\n\nPayors m ay give preference to generic drugs and biosim ilars m ore aggressively to generate savings and attem pt to stim ulate additional price com petition. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration am ong pharm acy chains, wholesalers and P BM s will increase pricing pressures in the industry. Som e states have im plem ented, and others are considering, patient access constraints or cost cutting under state regulated program s including the M edicaid program . States have continued to focus on addressing drug costs, generally by increasing price transparency or attem pting to lim it drug price increases for state-regulated insurance. M easures to regulate prices or paym ent for pharm aceutical products, including legislation on drug im portation and prescription drug affordability boards (P D ABs) that seek to im pose reim bursem ent lim its for certain drugs, could adversely affect our business. For additional inform ation on U .S. pricing and reim bursem ent, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.\n\nWe encounter sim ilar regulatory and legislative issues in m ost other countries in which we operate. In certain m arkets, such as in E U  m em ber states, the U .K., Japan, C hina, C anada, Australia and N ew Zealand, governm ents have significant power as large single payors to regulate prices, access criteria, or im pose other m eans of cost control, particularly as a result of recent global financing pressures. F or exam ple, the Q C E  and VBP  tender process in C hina has resulted in significant price cuts for off-patent m edicines. Additionally, in the EU, the E C  proposed the largest reform  of E U  pharm aceutical legislation in 20 years. In April 2024, the E uropean P arliam ent introduced am endm ents to the E C 's proposal.

      "question": "How does the use of investment-grade bonds in determining discount rates impact the unrecognized actuarial losses in DHR's pension obligations, given Pfizer's methodology for setting international pension discount rates?",
      "answer": "DHR uses investment-grade instruments to determine discount rates for non-U.S. pension plans, which directly affects the valuation of its pension obligations. Pfizer's international pension plans also use investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA/Aa or better to set discount rates, and in 2024, Pfizer reported that lower international discount rates increased pension obligations. Since DHR reported unrecognized actuarial losses of $399 million (after-tax: $303 million) as of December 31, 2024, a decrease in discount rates\u2014consistent with Pfizer's international experience\u2014would increase the present value of benefit obligations relative to plan assets, contributing to larger actuarial losses like those seen at DHR.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DHR determines non-U.S. pension discount rates based on investment-grade instruments with maturities matching expected benefit payouts.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Pfizer sets international pension discount rates by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA/Aa or better and reported that 2024 resulted in lower international discount rates compared to the prior year.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Lower discount rates increase the present value of pension obligations. Pfizer\u2019s international plans experienced this effect, which would similarly impact DHR\u2019s pension obligations. DHR reported unrecognized actuarial losses of $399 million, indicating that the use of lower investment-grade bond yields increased the gap between projected obligations and plan assets."

      "answer": "DHR faces risks related to environmental, health, and safety liabilities that could exceed its reserves, potentially leading to financial instability or reputational damage if new compliance costs or remediation efforts arise. Meanwhile, MDT's global manufacturing operations depend on a network of suppliers, some of which are sole sources, and any disruption in supply\u2014particularly due to regulatory non-compliance\u2014could halt production and impact product availability. Since both companies operate under stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks (such as FDA and EU MDR), the combined effect of potential supply chain interruptions at MDT and unforeseen compliance costs at DHR creates a compounded risk to their operational continuity and financial predictability within the same sector.",

Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator's or market perception of these clinical data, can adv ersely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements. In addition, our products and serv ices may support or be used in connection with customer products that are subject to clinical trials, and adv erse results in any such clinical trials may adversely affect future demand for our products and serv ices.\n\n## Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.\n\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about approv ed or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receiv e only permit us to market our products for the intended uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA or any other regulator determines that we hav e marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adv erse effects referenced under the risk factors set forth abov e.

Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may rev iew any manufacturer's decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We hav e made modifications to our products in the past and hav e determined based on our rev iew of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believ e do not require a new clearance or approv al. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civ il and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.\n\n## Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nOur operations, products and serv ices are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. env ironmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the env ironment, inv estigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at v arious sites, chemical constituents in products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for products sold. There can be no assurance that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) hav e been or will at all times be effectiv e.

In addition, there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future env ironmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adv ersely affect our business or financial statements.\n\nIn addition, we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged env ironmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by priv ate parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Production and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nWe manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers and have plans and measures in place to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. G enerally, we have been  able  to  obtain  adequate  supplies  of  such  raw  materials  and  components.  However,  due  to  the  U.S.  FDA's  manufacturing  requirements  and  those  of  other regulatory authorities, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources.\n\nFor additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to 'Item 2. Properties' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European regulatory authorities such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, the Health Products Regulatory Authority in the Republic of Ireland and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in G ermany, the China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), and other government agencies inside and outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance of our products. Our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws and government payor cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, as a result of the release and availability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including generative AI platforms, we have seen a global trend toward more comprehensive and refined regulation of AI that will impact our business, such as the White House's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence and the EU AI Act, that are designed to ensure the ethical use, security, and privacy of AI and create standards for transparency, accountability, and fairness.\n\n## Product Approval and Monitoring\n\nIn many countries where we do business, including the U.S., E.U. countries, Japan, and China, our products are subjected to approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality. For instance, authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally obtained in one of two primary ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. This process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process.\n\nIn the  E.U., conformity with the marketing authorization requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. The Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017, and it imposes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements (EU MDR). The regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on May 26, 2021. The European Commission recently extended the implementation period to the end of 2027 for high-risk devices and to the end of 2028 for medium and low risk devices.\n\nThe global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain ex isting approvals or obtain future approvals for our products. Regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing processes, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers' required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed products. We are also subject to periodic inspections  for  compliance  with  applicable  quality  system  regulations,  which  govern  the  methods  used  in,  and  the  facilities  and  controls  used  for,  the  design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector G eneral of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys G eneral), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future pre-market approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" under, \" We are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\"",

These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import, export and other international trade activities. We are subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs and burdens, as well as penalties if not complied with. Some governments impose economic sanctions and other  trade  restrictions  against  certain  countries,  persons  or  entities.  We  also  sell  and  provide  goods,  technology  and  services  to  agents,  representatives  and distributors who may in turn sell or provide such items to customers and other end-users in their own countries or by means of their own cross-border transactions. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability.

Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our products and therapies, customers, patients, and workforce.\n\nOur global operational footprint comes with the obligation for compliance and adherence to individual data security, confidentiality and breach notification laws at the State Level, Federal Level, and International Level. Ex amples of those laws include, in the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and various State privacy laws that have become effective recently. We are also subject to various other country-specific requirements around the world, such as the G eneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom's version of the same, and China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL).\n\nBecause the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation,  compliance  with  these  laws  and  regulations  may  require  significant  additional  cost  ex penditures  or  changes  in  products  or  business  that  increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities, withdrawal of noncompliant products from a market, and reputational harm.\n\n## Regulations Governing Reimbursement\n\nThe  delivery  of  our  devices  is  subject  to  regulation  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  and  comparable  state  and  non-U.S.  agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare  programs,  such  as  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid  programs,  as  well  as  the  government's  interest  in  regulating  the  quality  and  cost  of  healthcare.  Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services.\n\nU.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals or other healthcare fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws  that  apply  to  state  Medicaid  and  other  healthcare  programs  and  private  third-party  payors.  In  addition,  as  a  manufacturer  of  U.S.  FDA-approved  devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Similarly, other jurisdictions impose transparency reporting obligations relating to health care professional payments. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\n\nImplementation of legislative or regulatory reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.",

      "answer": "DHR's assessment that EU MDR and IVDR compliance will not have a material financial impact suggests a more confident or streamlined approach to regulatory adaptation, with extended compliance timelines (May 2026 to December 2028 for MDR, May 2026 to May 2028 for IVDR). In contrast, MDT emphasizes the potential for severe penalties such as business license suspension and mandatory price reductions due to EU regulatory non-compliance, indicating a higher perceived risk or more complex operational challenges. This difference in risk assessment may reflect divergent strategies or resource allocations for compliance, which could influence their competitive positioning in the EU market\u2014DHR potentially maintaining cost advantages or faster time-to-market, while MDT may face higher compliance costs or operational constraints.",

        "Step 2: Extract from MDT_10k_2024.pdf - MDT warns that EU regulatory non-compliance could result in severe penalties including business license suspension, mandatory price reductions, and criminal sanctions.",

In March 2023, the European Commission issued an amended regulation to eliminate the prev ious 'selloff' periods and extend the original transitional compliance dates for both the MDR and IVDR regulations. The amended MDR and IVDR timelines for becoming fully effectiv e are now from May 2026 to December 2028 for MDR devices and May 2026 to May 2028 for IVDR devices, depending on product classifications. Regulatory requirements in the United Kingdom ('UK') are also changing as a result of Brexit (the UK's withdrawal from the EU), and regulatory requirements in Switzerland are changing as a result of the country's withdrawal from its Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU Commission. Complying with the EU MDR, EU IVDR and the ev olv ing regulatory regimes in the UK and Switzerland requires modifications to our quality management systems, additional resources in certain functions and updates to technical files, among other changes, which has not and is not expected to hav e a material impact on the Company's financial results.\n\n## Other Healthcare Law s\n\nWe are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and v arious healthcare related laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, and the priv acy and security of health information, including the U.S. federal regulations described below. Many states, foreign countries and supranational bodies hav e also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the U.S. federal regulations discussed abov e and below, including the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws.\n\n- Many of our healthcare-related products are purchased by healthcare prov iders that typically bill v arious third-party payers, such as governmental healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), priv ate insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare serv ices prov ided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and serv ices from third-party payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, many of our healthcare-related products are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ('HHS'), including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Serv ices ('CMS'), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and serv ices, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. Third-party payers are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and serv ices and, in international markets, many countries hav e instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies (for further discussion of gov ernmental initiativ es to reduce healthcare costs, please see '-Healthcare Reform' below). Price ceilings, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cov er a product may reduce usage and patient demand for the product.\n- The U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiv ing or prov iding remuneration (including any kickback or bribe), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an indiv idual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or serv ice, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to hav e actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to v iolate it in order to hav e committed a violation.\n- The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ('HIPAA') prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including priv ate payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing or cov ering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the deliv ery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or serv ices. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the priv acy and security of patient identifiable health information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information. Similar to the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to hav e actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to v iolate it in order to hav e committed a v iolation.\n- The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program, knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to av oid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal gov ernment. The qui tam prov isions of the False Claims Act allow a priv ate indiv idual to bring actions on behalf of the federal gov ernment alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal gov ernment, and to share in any monetary recov ery. In addition, the gov ernment may assert that a claim including items and serv ices resulting from a v iolation of the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civ il False Claims Act.",

Due to the strong name recognition of the  Medtronic brand, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in diminished market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future.\n\nStrong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline.

For example, consequences of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine hav e included sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse impacts on energy supplies and prices, and such conflict or other conflicts may cause similar adv erse effects in the future. In addition to suspending sales prohibited by sanctions, the Company has suspended the shipment of products to Russia with the exception of products for the purposes of diagnosing and treating patients and producing v accines and therapeutics. Military conflicts also heighten other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of which can adv ersely affect our business and financial statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adv erse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including increased inflation, constraints on the av ailability of commodities, supply chain disruption and decreased business spending; disruptions to our or our business partners' global technology infrastructure, including through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion; adv erse changes in international trade policies and relations; claims, litigation and regulatory enforcement; potential retaliatory actions by gov ernments against companies, such as nationalization of foreign businesses; adv erse impacts on our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; terrorist activ ities; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; reputational risk; and constraints, v olatility, or disruption in the capital markets.\n\nIn 2024, Russia, Ukraine and Israel sales combined accounted for less than 1% of the Company's sales.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational Risks\n\n## Significant developments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.\n\nSignificant dev elopments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition, including laws and policies in areas such as trade, manufacturing, gov ernment purchasing, healthcare, intellectual property and inv estment/dev elopment, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, certain gov ernments hav e implemented policies to induce 're-shoring' of supply chains, reduce reliance on imported supplies and promote national production. The Chinese gov ernment has issued a series of policies in the past several years to promote the dev elopment and use of local medical dev ices. In addition, in recent years the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain imported goods and trade tensions between China and other countries (including the U.S.) hav e escalated, with countries imposing significant additional tariffs on a wide range of imported goods.

In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to gov ernment officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that hav e experienced gov ernmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civ il or criminal inv estigations and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civ il and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and inv estigatory fees.

In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data.\n\nAny of the foregoing problems, including future product liability claims or recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\n## Our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nOur devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services, including laws and regulations related to fair competition, kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payors. In certain circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are",

      "question": "How do the regulatory fee obligations described in AbbVie's and Abbott's 2024 10-K filings influence their respective budgeting strategies for global product approvals, particularly considering the requirement for country-specific clinical trials in markets like Japan, China, and the EU?",
      "answer": "Both AbbVie and Abbott identify regulatory fees and compliance costs as significant budgeting considerations, especially for global product approvals. AbbVie highlights the need for Japan-specific trials and bridging studies to demonstrate applicability of non-Japanese clinical data to Japanese patients, as well as the requirement for China-specific clinical data to support regulatory approval in China. These country-specific requirements increase the time, complexity, and cost of regulatory compliance for AbbVie, directly influencing its budgeting for clinical development and regulatory submissions. Similarly, Abbott notes that compliance with evolving international regulations, such as the Medical Devices Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the EU, substantially increases the cost and difficulty of obtaining and maintaining product approvals. Both companies expect these regulatory obligations\u2014including application, product, and user fees\u2014to require significant capital investment and technical expertise, shaping their financial planning by necessitating higher R&D and regulatory affairs budgets to manage global market entry and compliance.",

          "chunk_text": "regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or 'off-label' uses along with other labeling restrictions.\n\nOutside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency. After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.\n\nIn Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients are usually required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application.\n\nSimilarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products Administration for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial.\n\nThe regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan, India and Russia) also generally require that clinical studies that include data from patients in those countries be conducted in order to support local regulatory approval.\n\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans).\n\n## Regulation-Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing\n\nThe manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) i nspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially i ncrease the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties.\n\n## 9 | 2024 Form 10-K",

G overnment regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott's products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, postmarket changes to products, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott's laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require Abbott's laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.\n\nAbbott's international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott's investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.\n\nAbbott's laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement or payment to third-party payors, including government agencies such as Medicare and Medicaid, or governments. In the United States, these entities may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.\n\nAbbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott's business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In V itro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory  requirements  can  result  in  sanctions,  including  suspension,  revocation,  or  limitation  of  a  laboratory's  certification,  which  is  necessary  to  conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.\n\nAbbott's business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of healthcare products and their components that are  regularly  conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others.  These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.",

      "answer": "The combined fair value of Absolute return funds held by ABBV and ABT as of December 31, 2024, is $1,969 million. ABBV reports $155 million in Absolute return funds, with $66 million measured using Level 1 inputs and $89 million using Level 2 inputs. ABT reports $1,814 million in Absolute return funds, with $283 million measured using Level 1 inputs and the remaining $1,531 million measured at Net Asset Value (NAV), which is not categorized under Level 1 or Level 2. Therefore, the total amount measured using Level 1 inputs is $349 million ($66M + $283M), while $89 million is measured using Level 2 inputs, and $1,531 million is measured at NAV.",

      "question": "How do the equity compensation structures under the Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan differ between AbbVie and Abbott Laboratories, particularly in terms of agreement types and geographic distinctions?",
      "answer": "AbbVie's Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan includes a single form of agreement \u2014 the Non-Employee Director RSU Agreement \u2014 without geographic distinctions, as shown in Exhibit 10.35 of their Q1 2023 10-Q filing. In contrast, Abbott Laboratories\u2019 plan includes both domestic and foreign-specific agreements, as evidenced by Exhibit 10.11 (domestic Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Unit Agreement) and Exhibit 10.14 (Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Unit Agreement for foreign non-employee directors) from their 2013 and 2024 filings. This indicates that Abbott differentiates compensation structures based on director location, while AbbVie maintains a uniform structure under the plan.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, AbbVie's Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan is associated with Exhibit 10.35, which refers to a 'Form of AbbVie Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, as amended and restated' and links to the Non-Employee Director RSU Agreement.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Abbott Laboratories has multiple forms under their Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, including Exhibit 10.11 for domestic directors and Exhibit 10.14 for foreign non-employee directors, showing geographic differentiation in their equity compensation structure.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize \u2014 Comparing the two companies' structures reveals that Abbott Laboratories distinguishes between domestic and foreign non-employee directors in its equity compensation agreements, whereas AbbVie does not make such geographic distinctions, offering only a single type of RSU agreement under the same plan."
