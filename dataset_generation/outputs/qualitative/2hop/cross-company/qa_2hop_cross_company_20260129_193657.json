      "question": "What specific financial risks do GM and Tesla disclose regarding vehicle safety standards compliance, and how do these risks differ based on their respective regulatory challenges outlined in their 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "GM discloses that meeting or exceeding global vehicle safety standards is costly due to evolving and non-harmonized requirements, and that safety recalls\u2014triggered by defects or noncompliance\u2014could result in substantial costs. Tesla, on the other hand, highlights that evolving regulations around Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features could delay, restrict, or prohibit certain functionalities, which may adversely affect its business. While GM emphasizes direct financial exposure through potential recall costs, Tesla focuses on regulatory uncertainty affecting product availability and marketability, particularly for emerging autonomous driving technologies.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GM notes that compliance with global safety standards is costly and that recalls could result in substantial costs.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face financial risks from vehicle safety standards, but the nature of the risk differs: GM faces direct costs from compliance and recalls, while Tesla faces potential limitations on product features and marketability due to regulatory uncertainty."

In contrast, Amazon (AMZN) used the FIFO method for the majority of its inventories and reported a valuation allowance (write-down) of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023.

      "answer": "Amazon considers lease options to extend the lease term, terminate the lease early, or purchase the leased asset when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, and incorporates these into the lease classification and measurement. In contrast, Home Depot generally concludes that the exercise of renewal options is not reasonably certain at lease commencement, and therefore typically does not include them when determining the lease term used to calculate the right-of-use asset and lease liability.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Amazon incorporates options to extend, terminate, or purchase leases into lease classification and measurement if it is reasonably certain they will be exercised.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Home Depot evaluates renewal and termination options but generally concludes that renewal options are not reasonably certain to be exercised at lease commencement, and thus excludes them from lease term calculations."

This means AMZN's foreign NOL carryforwards are approximately 40 times larger than BKNG's U.S. state NOL carryforwards. This significant difference suggests that AMZN has accumulated much larger historical losses in its foreign operations that it may use to offset future taxable income in those jurisdictions, whereas BKNG's tax planning appears to involve more modest carryforward amounts primarily within U.S. states.",

AMZN assesses factors such as recent cumulative loss experience, expectations of future earnings, and the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes to determine the need for a valuation allowance.

      "answer": "Amazon's infrastructure costs for data centers, which include depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses, are part of its broader technology and infrastructure costs aimed at supporting AWS and other Amazon businesses. These costs are integral to Amazon's strategy of offering a wide variety of products and services, including innovative software and electronic devices, and are generally expensed as incurred. In contrast, Booking Holdings leases data center facilities globally, including significant locations such as its Booking.com headquarters in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This leasing approach allows Booking Holdings to maintain flexibility and potentially reduce capital expenditures, aligning with its strategy of ensuring adequate facilities to meet current requirements while maintaining the ability to expand as needed. The difference in strategies reflects Amazon's investment-heavy model versus Booking Holdings' flexible leasing model for supporting their respective technology infrastructures.",

      "answer": "AMZN actively registers and applies for domain names as part of its intellectual property strategy, treating them as critical to its success and relying on legal frameworks and agreements to protect these assets. In contrast, BKNG depends on domain names and other intangible rights secured through purchase or licensing agreements but faces greater operational and legal risk, as it may not always register or protect its intellectual property and could face litigation or licensing costs if third parties challenge its use. This contrast highlights AMZN's proactive legal posture versus BKNG's potentially more vulnerable and reactive position regarding domain name management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMZN 'has registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names' and treats domain names as critical to its success.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BKNG 'relies on intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets to support our business as well as domain names or other intangible rights or property secured through purchase, licensing or other agreements.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMZN's proactive registration of domain names contrasts with BKNG's broader dependency on domain names through licensing and purchase agreements, which exposes BKNG to greater legal and operational risk."

      "question": "Considering Home Depot's 21 retail stores in Nevada and Tesla's reliance on manufacturing operations in the state, how do the companies' geographic strategies in Nevada differ according to their 2023 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Home Depot's Nevada strategy focuses on retail presence with 21 stores, as listed in its store count by state table, indicating a consumer-facing footprint aimed at serving local markets. In contrast, Tesla's Nevada operations are centered on manufacturing capabilities, specifically highlighting the state as one of its key production sites alongside California, Texas, China, and Germany. Tesla emphasizes the importance of ramping production efficiently at these sites to meet mass-market vehicle goals, while also acknowledging risks like supply chain disruptions and construction delays that could impact financial performance. This contrast reflects Home Depot's localized retail distribution model versus Tesla's strategic manufacturing hub approach tied directly to production scalability and cost-efficiency.",

        "Step 1: From HD_10k_2023.pdf:page_28:chunk_2, extract the number of Home Depot stores in Nevada (21 stores).",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences: Home Depot\u2019s strategy centers on localized retail distribution through store presence, while Tesla's use of Nevada is tied to large-scale manufacturing, production scalability, and associated operational risks."

Amazon highlights the risk of being liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines, and potentially losing the ability to accept credit and debit card payments or process electronic funds transfers if they fail to comply with payment card association rules. Lowe\u2019s similarly emphasizes the risk of fines, higher transaction fees, and the loss of ability to accept card payments due to noncompliance with data security rules. Both companies rely on third-party processors for payment services, and any breach or failure in their data security systems could disrupt their operations and damage their reputations.",

For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer cobranded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\n\n## We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\n\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\n- changes in interest rates;\n- conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;\n- quarterly variations in operating results;\n- fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;\n- changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\n- changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n- changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n- changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\n- transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, social media activity, and speculation.\n\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, satellite communications services, healthcare, and other products and services that we offer or sell.

These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. Additionally, we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards, promotional financing, and other forms of electronic payment, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. National outages with our third-party credit and debit processor have resulted in lost sales and declined transactions after purchases. Future occurrences of such failures in third party systems are difficult to predict and may adversely affect our operations in unexpected ways.\n\nOur growing use of AI and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\n\nWe currently leverage internally developed and third-party developed AI, including both predictive and generative AI-powered solutions, to facilitate a more efficient operation of our business and to enhance the experience of our customers. We have developed an AI framework designed to enhance the customer experience and unlock productivity across three pillars - how we sell, how we shop, and how we work. We use AI-powered solutions designed to enable quick and personalized customer interactions, design assistance platforms, and tools for better forecasting, sourcing, inventory planning, and faster fulfillment. We face risk of competitive disadvantage if our competitors more effectively use AI to better serve customers, drive internal efficiencies, and create new or enhanced products or services. Additionally, we are making investments to expand our AI capabilities in our business, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning and AI technologies, as well as developing new features using AI technologies. We anticipate increased investments in the future to improve our use of AI, however, there can be no assurance that the development or usage of, or our investments in, AI will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business. Further, the rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment relating to AI and privacy could impact our implementation of AI technology and increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. Flaws, breaches, or malfunctions in these systems could lead to operational disruptions, data loss, erroneous decision-making, regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, or legal liability.\n\n## Investment-Related Risks\n\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks. We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies, and other various benefits. Our ability to deliver the ex pected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations. Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports, and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. Integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Additionally, we have recognized material impairments in the past and may do so in the future, including in connection with assets we have acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction, which have and may in the future materially reduce our earnings. Our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions and strategic transactions may also be subject to regulatory uncertainty due to the changing enforcement landscape. We may not",

These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. Additionally, we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards, promotional financing, and other forms of electronic payment, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. National outages with our third-party credit and debit processor have resulted in lost sales and declined transactions after purchases. Future occurrences of such failures in third party systems are difficult to predict and may adversely affect our operations in unexpected ways.\n\nOur growing use of AI and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\n\nWe currently leverage internally developed and third-party developed AI, including both predictive and generative AI-powered solutions, to facilitate a more efficient operation of our business and to enhance the experience of our customers. We have developed an AI framework designed to enhance the customer experience and unlock productivity across three pillars - how we sell, how we shop, and how we work. We use AI-powered solutions designed to enable quick and personalized customer interactions, design assistance platforms, and tools for better forecasting, sourcing, inventory planning, and faster fulfillment. We face risk of competitive disadvantage if our competitors more effectively use AI to better serve customers, drive internal efficiencies, and create new or enhanced products or services. Additionally, we are making investments to expand our AI capabilities in our business, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning and AI technologies, as well as developing new features using AI technologies. We anticipate increased investments in the future to improve our use of AI, however, there can be no assurance that the development or usage of, or our investments in, AI will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business. Further, the rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment relating to AI and privacy could impact our implementation of AI technology and increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. Flaws, breaches, or malfunctions in these systems could lead to operational disruptions, data loss, erroneous decision-making, regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, or legal liability.\n\n## Investment-Related Risks\n\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks. We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies, and other various benefits. Our ability to deliver the ex pected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations. Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports, and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. Integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Additionally, we have recognized material impairments in the past and may do so in the future, including in connection with assets we have acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction, which have and may in the future materially reduce our earnings. Our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions and strategic transactions may also be subject to regulatory uncertainty due to the changing enforcement landscape. We may not",

      "answer": "If interchange fees were to rise by 15% across all credit and debit card transactions, both Amazon and Lowe's would experience an increase in their operating costs due to their reliance on third-party processors for payment services. Amazon currently pays interchange and other fees for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, which may increase over time and raise its operating costs and lower profitability. Similarly, Lowe's pays interchange and other fees for credit and debit card transactions, which may also increase over time and raise its operating costs. Given that both companies rely on third-party processors for payment processing services, a 15% increase in interchange fees would directly translate into higher costs for both companies, although the exact dollar impact would depend on the volume and value of their respective card transactions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to interchange fee increases due to their reliance on third-party processors for electronic funds transfer services, and a 15% rise would proportionally increase their respective operating costs."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\n\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\n\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\n\n## Return Allowances\n\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in 'Accrued expenses and other' and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in 'Inventories' on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in 'Fulfillment' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Vendor Agreements\n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.",

      "question": "Amazon and Lowe\u2019s both mention interchange fees as a cost driver related to payment card association certification requirements. If interchange fees were to increase by 10 basis points for both companies, how would their respective operating costs be impacted based on their explicit disclosures about payment method reliance?",
      "answer": "Both Amazon and Lowe\u2019s disclose that interchange fees may increase over time and raise their operating costs. While neither company provides an exact percentage of revenue tied to interchange fees, both explicitly state that increases in these fees would raise operating costs and lower profitability (Amazon) or adversely affect operations (Lowe\u2019s). Therefore, a 10 basis point increase would result in higher costs for both companies, though the exact dollar impact cannot be calculated without specific volume and fee rate disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from Amazon's 10-K - Amazon states that interchange fees 'may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from Lowe\u2019s 10-K - Lowe\u2019s states that interchange fees 'may increase over time and raise our operating costs.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies explicitly link interchange fee increases to higher operating costs, though neither provides specific volume or fee rate data needed to calculate exact dollar impacts of a 10 basis point increase."

For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer cobranded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\n\n## We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\n\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\n- changes in interest rates;\n- conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;\n- quarterly variations in operating results;\n- fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;\n- changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\n- changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n- changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n- changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\n- transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, social media activity, and speculation.\n\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, satellite communications services, healthcare, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental and climate-related regulation, electronic contracts",

These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. Additionally, we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards, promotional financing, and other forms of electronic payment, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. National outages with our third-party credit and debit processor have resulted in lost sales and declined transactions after purchases. Future occurrences of such failures in third party systems are difficult to predict and may adversely affect our operations in unexpected ways.\n\nOur growing use of AI and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\n\nWe currently leverage internally developed and third-party developed AI, including both predictive and generative AI-powered solutions, to facilitate a more efficient operation of our business and to enhance the experience of our customers. We have developed an AI framework designed to enhance the customer experience and unlock productivity across three pillars - how we sell, how we shop, and how we work. We use AI-powered solutions designed to enable quick and personalized customer interactions, design assistance platforms, and tools for better forecasting, sourcing, inventory planning, and faster fulfillment. We face risk of competitive disadvantage if our competitors more effectively use AI to better serve customers, drive internal efficiencies, and create new or enhanced products or services. Additionally, we are making investments to expand our AI capabilities in our business, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning and AI technologies, as well as developing new features using AI technologies. We anticipate increased investments in the future to improve our use of AI, however, there can be no assurance that the development or usage of, or our investments in, AI will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business. Further, the rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment relating to AI and privacy could impact our implementation of AI technology and increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. Flaws, breaches, or malfunctions in these systems could lead to operational disruptions, data loss, erroneous decision-making, regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, or legal liability.\n\n## Investment-Related Risks\n\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks. We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies, and other various benefits. Our ability to deliver the ex pected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations. Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports, and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. Integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Additionally, we have recognized material impairments in the past and may do so in the future, including in connection with assets we have acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction, which have and may in the future materially reduce our earnings. Our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions and strategic transactions may also be subject to regulatory uncertainty due to the changing enforcement landscape. We may not",

If GM fails to meet consumer expectations in these areas, it could materially affect its results of operations and growth prospects. Similarly, Starbucks notes that its financial results could be adversely affected if it fails to meet consumer expectations regarding sustainability and environmental impact.

      "answer": "Both GM and Starbucks rely on joint venture partners to execute key elements of their business strategies, but the nature and risks of these relationships differ significantly. GM explicitly states that maintaining strong relationships with its joint venture partners is an important part of its China growth strategy, particularly as it plans to introduce new electric vehicles under global and local brands. However, GM's EBIT-adjusted performance was negatively impacted by a decrease in equity income, which includes results from joint ventures. Starbucks, on the other hand, depends on joint venture partners and other third parties for global store expansion and branded product distribution, but acknowledges that failures by these partners\u2014such as financial constraints, quality control issues, or brand misuse\u2014could negatively impact its financial results and brand reputation. Therefore, while both companies rely on joint ventures, GM's concern centers on growth and performance contribution, whereas Starbucks emphasizes risk mitigation related to brand consistency and operational quality.",

As both companies assert that their controls are effective, the difference in timing could affect the recency of the control evaluation relative to the fiscal year-end, potentially influencing the detection of any post-evaluation misstatements. SBUX\u2019s earlier evaluation may require additional monitoring to ensure continued control effectiveness through the end of its fiscal year, whereas TSLA\u2019s end-of-year evaluation may provide a more current assessment of internal controls at the reporting date.",

Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (September 29, 2024).\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Ex change Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this 10-K.\n\n## Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for ex ternal purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.\n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls, and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2024.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, has been audited by Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.",

As a result, we recognized $583 million of employee termination expenses in Restructuring and other in our consolidated income statement. These expenses were substantially paid with an immaterial accrual remaining in Accrued liabilities and other in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an impairment loss of $204 million as well as realized gains of $64 million in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Ex change Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for ex ternal purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",

As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we have accrued $69 million and $47 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $1.14 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax  rate.\n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax  years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2023 remain subject to ex amination for federal income tax  purposes.

On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, it may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of 'program payments' which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at G igafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.\n\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations.\n\n## Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\n\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023, which was achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.",

Tesla's stock options and RSUs typically vest over four years, with stock options exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates.

See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

If our ESG-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth could be adversely affected. If we are unable to meet our ESG-related goals, commitments, initiatives, or evolving stakeholder or industry expectations and standards, if we change or are perceived to have changed our goals, commitments, or initiatives, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to stakeholder interests in ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business, or financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we could be criticized by shareholders, stakeholders, regulators, or other interested parties for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals. We have been and could continue to be subject to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) targeting Starbucks, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth.\n\n## Certain activist shareholder actions have caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and adversely impact our stock price.\n\nWe actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, has resulted in, and could in the future result in, substantial costs, such as legal fees and ex penses, and the diversion of management's and our Board's attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our customers, partners, licensees, or business partners, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Activists or other shareholders holding a large portion of our outstanding shares will also have the ability to ex ert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers, acquisitions, and other significant business transactions, shareholder proposals, and amendments to our governing documents. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation\n\n## Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.\n\nOur policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules, and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption, and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. For example, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators may also shift the impact of applicable regulations on the business and the costs necessary to ensure compliance therewith, including through an expansion in the nature, scope, or complexity of matters on which we are required to report. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including expanded or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital ex penditures, incremental investments, and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Other ex amples of emerging and potentially relevant requirements are import tariffs and restrictions grounded in, among other things, alleged human rights abuses.\n\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux, and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies, or result in the possibility of fines, litigation, or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and",

New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\n\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement policy associated with the regulations, continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\n\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require ex tensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where Tesla has a market presence.\n\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.",

      "answer": "Amazon faces significant exposure to evolving taxation laws due to its global e-commerce model, which subjects it to a wide array of jurisdiction-specific tax regulations and compliance requirements. These laws influence its operating costs, profitability, and ability to offer certain payment methods, especially as tax rules for digital transactions and cross-border commerce become more complex. In contrast, McDonald's, while also subject to global taxation laws, notes that compliance costs related to these regulations are not expected to have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. This difference reflects McDonald's more stable, brick-and-mortar business model with less cross-border transactional complexity compared to Amazon's rapidly evolving digital ecosystem.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon is subject to evolving taxation laws that affect its operating costs and profitability due to its global e-commerce and digital services model.",

For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer cobranded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\n\n## We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\n\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\n- changes in interest rates;\n- conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;\n- quarterly variations in operating results;\n- fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;\n- changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\n- changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n- changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n- changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\n- transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, social media activity, and speculation.\n\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, satellite communications services, healthcare, and other products and services that we offer or sell.

The Company has established and enforces high food safety and quality standards. The quality management systems and processes involve ongoing product reviews, supplier visits and third-party v erifications with performance expectations. The Company requires periodic third-party food safety audits of suppliers to verify compliance with its food safety and quality standards. The audits help ensure that suppliers are meeting M cDonald's Supplier Quality M anagement System (SQM S) standards. In addition, the Company promotes the consistency of its core menu by regular sensory evaluations and calibration trainings. A  digital transformation project is underway to promote data excellence and continuous measures on quality and food safety performance. A  Food Safety A dvisory Council, comprised of the Company's internal food safety experts as well as suppliers and outside experts, supports the Company's food safety risk management work and provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety and quality. The Company also has ongoing programs to elevate food safety culture throughout the business by educating employees about food safety practices, including proper storage, handling and preparation of food for customers, and conducting trainings for its suppliers and restaurant operators to share best practices on food safety and quality.\n\nThe Company collaborates with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous improvement across its global supply chain. The Company also works closely with suppliers and other third-party experts to drive sustainable sourcing initiatives and to improve the health and welfare of the animals within its supply chain. Led by its Global Chief Supply Chain Officer, the Company has a comprehensive strategy that its global supply chain organization leverages to identify , assess, and manage risk in its supply chain.\n\nTo reinforce the importance of its values, the Company maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to all of its suppliers. The Company expects all of its suppliers to meet the rigorous standards set forth in the Code, which cover areas including human rights, workplace environment, business integrity and environmental management. In addition, the Company has a comprehensive Supplier Workplace Accountability (SWA) program to help suppliers understand its expectations, verify compliance and work toward continuous improvement.\n\n## PRODUCTS\n\nMcDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes.\n\nMcDonald's menu features hamburgers and cheeseburgers, the Big M ac, the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the Filet-O-Fish, and several chicken sandwiches like the M cChicken, M cCrispy and M cSpicy, as well as Chicken M cNuggets, World Famous Fries, shakes, M cFlurry frozen desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, cookies, pies, soft drinks, coffee, M cCaf\u00e9 beverages and other beverages.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include breakfast sandwiches, such as the Egg M cM uffin, Sausage M cM uffin with Egg and M cGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches, oatmeal, hash browns, breakfast burritos and hotcakes.\n\nIn addition to these menu items, restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions.\n\nTaste, quality, choice, value and nutrition are important to customers, and the Company is continuously evolving its menu to meet its customers' needs, including testing new products on an ongoing basis.\n\n## MARKETING\n\nMcDonald's global brand is well known. M arketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed with customers in mind and are focused on promoting the M cDonald's brand and differentiating the Company from its competitors. M arketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience, cultural relevance and the customer experience.\n\n## INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY\n\nThe Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the \"M cDonald's\" trademark and the Golden A rches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. The Company's patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nMcDonald's restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of traditional, fast casual and other food service competitors. The Company measures its competitive position within the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, which is inclusive of the Company's primary competition of quickservice restaurants, but also includes 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, convenience stores, street stalls or kiosks, caf\u00e9s, specialist coffee shops, selfservice cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The Company competes among quick-service restaurants primarily on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety and product quality.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS\n\nThe Company has global operations and is therefore subject to the laws of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. A s discussed under 'Legal Proceedings - Government Regulations' on page 37 of this Form 10-K, governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business, including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, competition, zoning, employment and taxation.\n\nWhile costs associated with legal and regulatory compliance have increased along with the number and scope of laws and regulations affecting our business, these costs are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 6",

As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's taxpositions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a taxposition's technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of taxbenefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2024, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $6.5 billion for various taxcontingencies. Auditing the recognition and measurement of the Company's taxcontingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a taxposition is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various taxpositions can be complexand   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | Wetested controls over the Company's process to assess the technical merits of its taxcontingencies, including controls over: the assessment as to whether a taxposition is more likely than not to be sustained; the measurement of the benefit of its taxpositions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the development of the related disclosures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

The Company , like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. A ccordingly , tax  liabilities are recorded when, in management's judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on management's assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled.\n\nAuditing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions was challenging because the measurement is based on interpretations of complex tax laws and because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on studies that may produce a range of outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm's-length transaction).\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to assess the technical merits and measurement of these unrecognized tax benefits. For example, we tested management's review of the unrecognized tax benefit calculations, which included evaluation of the comparable transactions used to determine the ranges of outcomes, pricing conclusions reached in management's transfer pricing studies and the assessment of other third-party information.\n\nWith the assistance of our income tax professionals, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the technical merits of the Company's position and assessing the recognition and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing. For example, we assessed the inputs utilized and the pricing conclusions reached in the Company's transfer pricing studies and compared the methods used to industry benchmarks. In addition, we used our knowledge of historical settlement activity , income tax laws and other market information to evaluate the technical merits of the Company's positions. We also independently verified our understanding of the status of income tax examinations with the Company's external legal counsel.\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Y oung LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1964.\n\nChicago, Illinois February 25, 2025",

Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\n\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers' development and use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\n\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\n\n## We Have Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign ex change rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from ex pectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\n\n## Operating Risks\n\n## Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\n- our ability to retain and increase sales to ex isting customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;\n- our ability to retain and ex pand our network of sellers;\n- our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n- the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;",

The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fix ing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.\n\n## We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture\n\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee,",

Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking or conditional words, such as 'could,' 'should,' 'can,' 'continue,' 'aim,' 'estimate,' 'forecast,' 'intend,' 'look,' 'may,' 'will,' 'ex pect,' 'believ e,' 'anticipate,' 'plan,' 'remain,' 'confident,' 'commit,' 'enable,' 'potential' and \"trajectory \" or similar ex pressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the dates the statements are made. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update such forward-looking statements. Y ou should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\n\n## Risk F actors\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. A dditional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely affect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies - including the components of our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy - must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's continued ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development;\n- innovate and differentiate the M cDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- build upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including building one of the world's largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement;\n- run great restaurants by building the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform which enables franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently  and utiliz e the latest cloud-based technology  to make it easier for crews to deliv er ex ceptional customer service;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and\n- evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, if the execution of our strategies proves to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at M cDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, as well as by our perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.\n\nIf we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 28",

      "question": "How does the designation of third-party foreign currency denominated debt by MCD relate to NKE's disclosure about hedging intercompany loans, and what does this imply about their respective foreign exchange risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "MCD designates $14.4 billion of third-party foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which helps offset translation adjustments recorded in OCI. This indicates that MCD actively uses debt as a hedge instrument to manage foreign exchange exposure on its international investments. In contrast, NKE discloses that it substantially hedges its non-functional currency intercompany loans using forward contracts, which are included in its Value at Risk (VaR) calculation, and considers the associated foreign exchange risk to be immaterial to its consolidated financials. This implies that while both companies manage foreign exchange risk, MCD relies more heavily on designated debt instruments for hedging long-term investments, whereas NKE uses derivative contracts to manage short-to-medium term intercompany exposures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From MCD's 10-K, extract the $14.4 billion of third-party foreign currency denominated debt designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the two approaches to foreign exchange risk management: MCD uses designated third-party debt for long-term investment hedges, while NKE uses forward contracts for intercompany loan exposures.",
        "Step 4: Conclude that the designation by MCD and disclosure by NKE reflect different strategies for managing foreign exchange risk, aligned with the nature and timing of their international exposures."

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies, although currently maintaining effective internal controls, face the same theoretical risk related to deterioration in compliance, which could impact financial reporting accuracy in the future.

Additionally, MCD notes that insurance proceeds may be delayed or insufficient to fully cover losses from such events. In contrast, NKE highlights that social unrest can damage brand image and diminish consumer trust, particularly due to public perception of their stance on social causes and personalities. Negative publicity, amplified by social media, can reduce long-term demand for NKE's products and affect their financial condition. While MCD focuses on operational disruptions and supply chain impacts, NKE emphasizes brand reputation risks and the influence of consumer sentiment on sales.",

GM has similar lender protections in its agreements, where a covenant violation could allow lenders to declare outstanding amounts immediately due and restrict future borrowings. Both companies are subject to conditions that limit borrowing if covenants are not met, but BKNG specifically notes that its facility includes swingline loans up to $100 million and letters of credit up to $80 million, while GM highlights the potential enforcement of collateral pledges in case of default. This indicates that while both companies face lender-imposed constraints tied to financial covenants, GM\u2019s lenders have additional remedies such as collateral enforcement.",

      "question": "How did the suspension of travel services in Belarus impact Booking.com's year-over-year room night growth in 2023 when compared to 2022, and how does this relate to General Motors' decision to stop imports to Belarus around the same time?",
      "answer": "Booking.com reported that excluding room nights from bookers in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, its overall room nights in 2023 were up about 17% year-over-year compared to 2022. This indicates that the suspension of travel services in Belarus (and Russia/Ukraine) had a measurable impact on its growth metrics. Around the same time, General Motors also stopped importing vehicles and parts to Belarus starting March 2022, aligning with broader corporate responses to geopolitical events. Both companies took action in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with Booking.com suspending services and GM halting imports, demonstrating parallel strategic shifts in operations within Belarus.",

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2023, GM Financial had foreign currency swaps with a notional amount of $8.0 billion, while Booking.com used foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency risk but did not disclose a specific notional amount. GM Financial believes its market risk exposure related to changes in currency exchange rates was insignificant due to its use of swaps to convert foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of receivables and leased assets. In contrast, Booking.com evaluates its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and uses derivatives as appropriate, but still faces potential income statement, cash flow, and fair value exposures. Therefore, GM Financial's larger and more structured use of foreign currency swaps significantly reduces its effective market risk exposure compared to Booking.com, which retains more exposure due to its shorter-term and less quantified hedging strategy.",

Booking Holdings, on the other hand, provides a general qualitative risk disclosure about its investment portfolio without specifying portfolio value or quantifying interest rate sensitivity, noting only that credit losses, impairments, and changes in fair values have had a significant impact on quarterly net income.

      "answer": "Nike's accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions increased by $45 million in fiscal 2022, reaching $248 million as of May 31, 2022. This indicates a growing U.S. tax exposure related to uncertain international tax positions. In contrast, Amazon stated it intends to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign subsidiary earnings outside the U.S. where repatriation would otherwise incur significant additional U.S. tax costs. This strategy aims to minimize U.S. tax exposure on foreign earnings, directly contrasting with Nike\u2019s shift away from indefinite reinvestment and its resulting increased liability for U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these warrants had a fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, and are recorded within 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a writedown of inventory, was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased by $45 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, increased by $45 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, and decreased by $16 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. As of May 31, 2022 and 2021, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $248 million and $203 million, respectively (excluding federal benefit) and included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022 and 2021, long-term income taxes payable were $535 million and $640 million, respectively, and were included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. IRS for fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2016, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. Tax years after 2011 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $20 million within the next 12 months. In January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company's income taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase.\n\nThe Company historically had not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, in connection with a change in the Company's legal entity structure that reduced the withholding tax consequences of a decision to remit undistributed earnings in the Netherlands, the Company changed its assertion regarding its ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has evaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the legal entity restructuring and determined that any historical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. There is no deferred tax liability associated with those earnings.\n\nA portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2031. This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday, before taking into consideration other U.S. indirect tax provisions, was $221 million, $238 million and $238 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.14, $0.15 and $0.15 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nDeferred tax assets as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, were reduced by a valuation allowance. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a valuation allowance was provided for U.S. capital loss carryforwards and on tax benefits generated by certain entities with operating losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, a valuation allowance was provided for U.S. capital loss carryforwards and on tax benefits generated by certain entities with operating losses. There was a $7 million net increase in the valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, compared to a $14 million net decrease for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, and $62 million net decrease for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020.\n\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets of $103 million as of May 31, 2022 for U.S. foreign tax credit carry-forwards which will begin to expire in 2032.\n\nThe Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $44 million as of May 31, 2022. If not utilized, such losses will expire as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Amazon's strategy of indefinitely reinvesting foreign earnings outside the U.S. avoids additional U.S. taxation upon repatriation, directly lowering its effective tax rate by deferring U.S. taxes on those earnings. In contrast, Nike has $848 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May 31, 2022, which represents uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, could reduce its effective tax rate. While Amazon avoids triggering U.S. tax liability through its reinvestment policy, Nike's effective tax rate remains exposed to potential increases if its unrecognized tax benefits are disallowed. Both companies manage complex international tax environments, but Amazon\u2019s indefinite reinvestment approach provides more certainty in tax planning, whereas Nike\u2019s reliance on unrecognized tax benefits introduces greater volatility in its tax provision.",

These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a writedown of inventory, was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.",

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded income tax expense of $605 million for the year ended May 31, 2022, and has net deferred tax assets of $1,665 million, including a valuation allowance of $19 million, and total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $848 million as of May 31, 2022, $626 million of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings. Management assesses the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization. A valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset to the extent that recovery is not likely. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. As disclosed by management, the use of significant judgment and estimates, as well as the interpretation and application of complex tax laws is required by management to determine the Company's provision for income taxes.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for income taxes is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to (i) management's assessment of complex tax laws and regulations as it relates to determining the provision for income taxes and (ii) management's assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, specifically related to available tax planning strategies. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to income taxes, including controls over management's assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the effect on the Company's tax provision of changes in its legal entity structure, evaluating changes in and compliance with tax laws, and testing the calculation of the provision of income taxes, including assessing management's tax planning strategies for the utilization of deferred tax assets. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating changes in and compliance with the tax laws and regulations and the provision for income taxes.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Portland, Oregon July 21, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1974.",

      "answer": "Amazon held $13.0 billion in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities as part of its cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, and evaluated unrealized losses for expected credit losses. Nike held $13.0 billion in short-term investments, including investment grade fixed-income securities, and managed credit risk by maintaining investment grade ratings.

Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\n\n## Investments\n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in 'Cash and cash equivalents' or 'Marketable securities' on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMarketable fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nEquity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, and are classified as 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these investments had a carrying value of $2.7 billion and $603 million.\n\nEquity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in 'Equity-method investment activity, net of tax' on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\n\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Long-Lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\n\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\n## Accrued Expenses and Other\n\nIncluded in 'Accrued expenses and other' on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.6 billion and $9.1 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $4.7 billion and $5.2 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.",

As of May 31, 2022, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.\n\nLiquidity is also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $3 billion program. As of May 31, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\nWe may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs.\n\nTo date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $13.0 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2022, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 113 days.\n\nWe believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.\n\nOur material cash requirements as of May 31, 2022, were as follows:\n\n- Debt Obligations - Refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8 - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n- Operating Leases - Refer to Note 19 - Leases in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n- Endorsement Contracts - As of May 31, 2022, we had endorsement contract obligations of $7.6 billion, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months, representing approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than these amounts as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors and the contracts generally do not stipulate a minimum amount of cash to be spent on the product.\n- Product Purchase Obligations - As of May 31, 2022, we had product purchase obligations of $6.6 billion, all of which are payable within the next 12 months. Product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.\n- Other Purchase Obligations - As of May 31, 2022, we had $3.1 billion of other purchase obligations, with $1.7 billion payable within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations primarily include technology investments, construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, and may include open purchase orders for non-product purchases.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9 - Income Taxes and Note 13 - Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively.\n\nAs a part of the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as of May 31, 2022, we had $730 million in estimated future cash payments, with $86 million payable within the next 12 months. These amounts represent the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which are reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized. Refer to Part II, Item 8.

Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\n\n## The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business\n\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have 'key person' life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.\n\n## Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\n\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises), or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\n\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company's sales. Therefore, when the other company's offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.\n\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:\n\n- disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n- impairment of other relationships;",

The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work on-site for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days, may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. We also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees.\n\n## Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States or foreign employment regulations.\n\nWe have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which could have a direct impact on our operating costs. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs. There is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws, criminal activity, personal injury and other claims. In addition, if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we could be vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Operating a Global Business\n\n## Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.\n\nVirtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political tensions, unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. Changes in the U.S. government's import and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards or customs restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as the anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, independent contractors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films - are locally available to manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware - are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 18",

      "answer": "Amazon's first-quarter 2022 guidance anticipated an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points on net sales from foreign exchange rates and expected operating income to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, partly due to global supply chain constraints. Meanwhile, Nike\u2019s wholesale revenues decreased 4% due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China and global supply chain constraints, while its EBIT increased 23% despite these challenges. This shows that while both companies were impacted by supply chain issues, Amazon saw a direct negative impact on operating income expectations, whereas Nike managed to grow EBIT through gross margin expansion even as wholesale revenues declined.",

These forwardlooking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of February 3, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.' This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 3, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above.\n\n## First Quarter 2022 Guidance\n\n- Net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $117.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8% compared with first quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n- Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in first quarter 2021. This guidance includes approximately $1.0 billion lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning on January 1, 2022.\n- This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.",

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2022 due to revenue growth in North America, Western Europe and licensee markets, partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 22%, led by strong digital demand. Wholesale revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China as well as global supply chain constraints. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 6%, while ASP increased 12%, driven by growth in direct to consumer.\n\nReported EBIT increased 23%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense, while operating overhead increased primarily due to higher professional services costs.",

      "answer": "Amazon's 2023 10-K highlights that its customer engagement strategies positively impact profitability by driving demand and enabling scale efficiencies. In contrast, Nike's 2023 10-K states that rising costs of endorser agreements and risks related to brand image negatively impact operating margins due to increased marketing investments and potential inventory write-downs from demand forecasting errors.

      "question": "How does the reliance on contract manufacturers impact both Amazon's and Nike's financial obligations and operational risks, particularly in terms of inventory commitments and supply chain disruptions?",
      "answer": "Amazon has non-cancellable purchase commitments with contract manufacturers based on forecasted customer demand, and if demand decreases, Amazon may incur additional costs. Nike, on the other hand, depends heavily on contract manufacturers for the majority of its products, and any disruptions in manufacturing\u2014such as labor shortages, wage increases, or transportation delays\u2014could lead to increased costs and delays in product availability. Both companies face financial and operational risks from their reliance on contract manufacturers, though Amazon's risk is tied to inventory commitments, while Nike's is more focused on global supply chain volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon has non-cancellable purchase commitments with contract manufacturers based on forecasted customer demand, and reducing these commitments may result in additional costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Nike relies on contract manufacturers for most of its products, and risks such as labor shortages, wage increases, and transportation delays could lead to increased costs and product availability issues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on contract manufacturers, but the nature of their exposure differs: Amazon faces financial risk from inventory commitments, while Nike faces operational risk from global manufacturing and logistics disruptions."

      "question": "How does Amazon's use of contract manufacturers for electronic device components compare with Nike's reliance on contract manufacturers for footwear supply, and what specific financial commitments or risks does each company disclose in their 2023 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Amazon discloses that it uses several contract manufacturers to produce its electronic devices and has entered into non-cancellable purchase commitments based on forecasted customer demand, which could result in additional costs if commitments are reduced. Nike, on the other hand, relies on a concentrated group of contract manufacturers to supply all of its footwear products and highlights the risk that any disruption in supply could impair its ability to meet customer needs. Both companies depend heavily on external manufacturing partners, but Amazon emphasizes financial commitments tied to demand forecasts, while Nike focuses on operational risks related to supply chain continuity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Amazon's 2023 10-K, extract the detail that the company uses several contract manufacturers for electronic device components and has non-cancellable purchase commitments based on forecasted demand.",
        "Step 2: From Nike's 2023 10-K, extract the detail that the company relies on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of its footwear products and that any disruption could impair its ability to meet customer needs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize by comparing the nature of each company's reliance on contract manufacturers\u2014Amazon's financial exposure through purchase commitments versus Nike's operational risk from supply concentration."

      "question": "How do Amazon's non-cancellable purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and Nike's reliance on a single contract manufacturer for more than 10% of its apparel production expose each company to distinct financial risks in their supply chains?",
      "answer": "Amazon is exposed to financial risk through its non-cancellable purchase commitments with contract manufacturers, which are based on forecasted customer demand. If Amazon reduces these commitments, it may incur additional costs, and any overcommitments could lead to excess inventory or financial penalties. This creates a direct financial exposure tied to demand forecasting accuracy. Nike, on the other hand, faces a different risk: one contract manufacturer alone accounts for more than 10% of its apparel production. If events were to prevent Nike from acquiring products from this manufacturer or other suppliers in a particular country, its operations could be temporarily disrupted, and alternate sources might not be as cost-effective, leading to an adverse financial impact on profitability. While Nike believes it could develop alternative supply sources over time, the short-term disruption could still have measurable financial consequences.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Amazon's 10-K, extract the detail that the company has non-cancellable purchase commitments with contract manufacturers based on forecasted customer demand, and that reducing these commitments could result in additional costs.",
        "Step 2: From Nike's 10-K, extract the fact that one apparel contract manufacturer accounts for more than 10% of Nike Brand apparel production, and that supply disruption could lead to temporary operational issues and less cost-effective alternatives.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two findings to explain how both companies are exposed to supply chain risks, but in different financial forms\u2014Amazon through contractual financial penalties and Nike through potential short-term supply disruption and increased sourcing costs."

Amazon explicitly states that its foreign net operating loss carryforwards are subject to realizability based on generating net income in certain foreign jurisdictions or future capital gains, and that a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2025.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax -related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the ex tent to which, additional tax es will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits.

      "answer": "Amazon structures its operations in China through contractual relationships with third parties to comply with local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements. In India, the government restricts foreign ownership of companies involved in online multi-brand retail, so Amazon provides marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers while holding an indirect minority interest in one of them. These arrangements allow Amazon to continue operating in these markets despite restrictive data localization and foreign ownership rules. Meanwhile, Tesla faces financial risks related to compliance with data localization and cybersecurity regulations, including potential fines, penalties, and damages from data breaches or regulatory noncompliance. Tesla may also incur significant costs from legal proceedings, audits, or investigations related to data protection authorities.",

In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the ex pected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or ex ecute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.\n\n## Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\n\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further ex pand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating ex perience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\n\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\n- local economic and political conditions;\n- government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n- restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n- business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, ex ports, web services, electronic devices, and communications services;\n- limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n- limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\n- shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n- laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n- lower levels of use of the internet;\n- lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\n- lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\n- difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n- different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\n- compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\n- laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and tax es; and\n- geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\n\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.\n\nThe People's Republic of China ('PRC') and India regulate Amazon's and its affiliates' businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For ex ample, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace.

Risks and penalties could include ongoing audit requirements, data protection authority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers' personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to the personal information we process and handle. A major breach of our network security and systems may occur despite defensive measures, and may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings.\n\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\n\n## We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\n\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\n\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\n## The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $488.54 per share and a low of $138.80 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance.

Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\n\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers' development and use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\n\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\n\n## We Have Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign ex change rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from ex pectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen.

The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease.

These include a wide variety of mechanisms, controls, technologies, methods, systems, and other processes that are designed to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data. The data include confidential, proprietary, and business and personal information that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our business, including on behalf of third parties. We also use systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security incident at a third-party vendor or customer. Additionally, we use processes to oversee and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party technology and systems, including: technology and systems we use for encryption and authentication; employee email; content delivery to customers; back-office support; and other functions.\n\nAs part of our risk management process, we conduct application security assessments, vulnerability management, penetration testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments. We also maintain a variety of incident response plans that are utilized when incidents are detected. We require employees with access to information systems, including all corporate employees, to undertake data protection and cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.\n\nWe have a unified and centrally-coordinated team, led by our chief security officer, that is responsible for implementing and maintaining centralized cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon in close coordination with senior leadership and other teams across Amazon. Reporting to our chief security officer are a number of ex perienced chief information security officers responsible for various parts of our business, including AWS, each of whom is supported by a team of trained cybersecurity professionals. In addition to our extensive in-house cybersecurity capabilities, at times we also engage assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks.\n\nOur cybersecurity risks and associated mitigations are evaluated by senior leadership, including as part of our enterprise risk assessments that are reviewed by the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Such risks and mitigations are also subject to oversight by the Security Committee of our Board of Directors.

CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, ex tortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards.

      "answer": "AMZN conducts penetration testing as part of a broader set of processes that include application security assessments, vulnerability management, security audits, and incident response plans. These activities are supported by a centralized cybersecurity team led by the Chief Security Officer, with specialized Chief Information Security Officers for business units like AWS. In contrast, TSLA performs penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques, and integrates it into a multi-faceted cybersecurity strategy that includes proactive privacy reviews, bug bounty programs, and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified information security management. TSLA\u2019s cybersecurity governance involves quarterly reporting to the Audit Committee by leaders from Information Security, Product Security, Compliance, and Legal teams. Both companies use penetration testing but differ in organizational structure and third-party engagement emphasis.",

Cybersecurity\n\nWe have processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from potential unauthorized occurrences on or through our electronic information systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or the information residing on those systems. These include a wide variety of mechanisms, controls, technologies, methods, systems, and other processes that are designed to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data. The data include confidential, proprietary, and business and personal information that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our business, including on behalf of third parties. We also use systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security incident at a third-party vendor or customer. Additionally, we use processes to oversee and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party technology and systems, including: technology and systems we use for encryption and authentication; employee email; content delivery to customers; back-office support; and other functions.\n\nAs part of our risk management process, we conduct application security assessments, vulnerability management, penetration testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments. We also maintain a variety of incident response plans that are utilized when incidents are detected. We require employees with access to information systems, including all corporate employees, to undertake data protection and cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.\n\nWe have a unified and centrally-coordinated team, led by our chief security officer, that is responsible for implementing and maintaining centralized cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon in close coordination with senior leadership and other teams across Amazon. Reporting to our chief security officer are a number of ex perienced chief information security officers responsible for various parts of our business, including AWS, each of whom is supported by a team of trained cybersecurity professionals. In addition to our extensive in-house cybersecurity capabilities, at times we also engage assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks.\n\nOur cybersecurity risks and associated mitigations are evaluated by senior leadership, including as part of our enterprise risk assessments that are reviewed by the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Such risks and mitigations are also subject to oversight by the Security Committee of our Board of Directors. Additional information about cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors,' under the heading 'We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Incidents,' which should be read in conjunction with the information above.\n\nThe Security Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees our policies and procedures for protecting our cybersecurity infrastructure and for compliance with applicable data protection and security regulations, and related risks. The Security Committee receives reports regarding such risks from management, including our chief security officer, and reports to the Board at least annually. The Security Committee also oversees the Board's response to any significant cybersecurity incidents.\n\nOur chief security officer, who has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills gained from over 15 years of work experience on the security team at Amazon and an extensive career in the technology and cybersecurity industries as a senior executive in the federal government, heads the team responsible for implementing and maintaining cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon and reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.",

CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, ex tortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers.

      "question": "What is the difference in total employer contributions to 401(k) savings plans between Nike and Tesla for their most recent fiscal years, and how do their respective matching structures reflect differing employee benefit strategies?",
      "answer": "Nike contributed $153 million and Tesla contributed $99 million to their 401(k) savings plans in their most recent fiscal years, resulting in a difference of $54 million. Nike's contributions are part of a broader qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan where all U.S. employees can participate, with contributions included in either Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense. In contrast, Tesla's 401(k) savings plan includes a structured employer match of 50% of employee contributions up to a maximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of eligible compensation, with vesting after one year of service. These differences reflect Nike's more broadly integrated benefit strategy and Tesla's targeted incentive approach tied to employee tenure and compensation levels.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract Nike's 401(k) contribution amount - $153 million in fiscal year 2024 as stated in the qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan section.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two contributions: $153 million (Nike) - $99 million (Tesla) = $54 million.",

        "Step 5: Analyze Tesla's employee benefit strategy - structured 50% employer match up to 6% of eligible compensation (capped at $3,000), with vesting after one year of service.",

      "question": "What is the combined impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on NKE and TSLA's U.S. Dollar-denominated revenues, given that both companies conduct significant business in foreign currencies?",
      "answer": "Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impact both NKE and TSLA's U.S. Dollar-denominated revenues because both companies conduct significant business in foreign currencies. For NKE, a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Similarly, TSLA experiences reduced revenues as measured in U.S. dollars when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies in which it transacts. This means that both companies face a decline in reported revenues when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. Dollar, and an increase when they strengthen, though neither chunk provides exact figures for the total revenue impact.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from NKE 10-K - NKE conducts business in various foreign currencies and reports consolidated financials in U.S. Dollars; weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects its U.S. Dollar value of sales and earnings.",
        "Step 2: Extract from TSLA 10-K - TSLA transacts globally in multiple currencies and notes that strengthening of the U.S. Dollar reduces its revenues as measured in U.S. dollars.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which affect their U.S. Dollar-denominated revenues in a similar manner. A stronger U.S. Dollar reduces the value of foreign-denominated revenues for both companies, creating a parallel financial risk."

      "answer": "GM determines the fair value of Level 2 instruments using the market approach, relying on observable market inputs such as quoted prices of similar instruments, foreign exchange forward curves, and interest rate forward curves. This approach directly affects how GM reports its hedging gains and losses, such as the $375 million loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss for foreign currency cash flow hedges in 2024. In contrast, LOW determines fair value for Level 2 instruments using pricing models that rely on observable inputs like benchmark yields, issuer spreads, and broker-dealer quotes. These inputs influence LOW\u2019s classification and valuation of financial assets and liabilities, ensuring consistency in fair value reporting when active market quotes are unavailable. As a result, both companies depend on observable market inputs to determine fair value for Level 2 instruments, but the specific inputs and methods lead to distinct financial reporting outcomes based on their respective hedging and valuation practices.",

Our dividends declared per common share were $0.48, $0.36 and $0.18 and our total dividends paid on common stock were $530 million, $477 million and $257 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote. The liquidation rights of holders of our common stock are secondary to the payment or provision for payment of all our debts and liabilities and to holders of our preferred stock, if any such shares are then outstanding.\n\nIn November 2023, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under our share repurchase program by $10.0 billion to an aggregate of $11.4 billion and we entered into the ASR Agreements to repurchase an aggregate amount of $10.0 billion of our common stock under the authorized share repurchase program. In December 2023, we advanced the $10.0 billion and received approximately 215 million shares of our common stock with a value of $6.8 billion, which were immediately retired. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we received and retired approximately 29 million additional shares upon settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements. The final number of shares received was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreements, less a discount pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. Because of our ability to settle in shares, the $ 3.2 billion prepaid forward contract was classified as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital within the consolidated statement of equity at December 31, 2023. Upon settlement, the amount over par was allocated on a pro-rata basis, between Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings.\n\nIn June 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization to repurchase up to an additional $6.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, in addition to shares received under the ASR program, we purchased approximately 140 million and 30 million shares of  our  outstanding  common  stock  for  $7.1  billion  and  $1.1  billion.  In  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  we  purchased  approx imately 64  million  shares  of  our outstanding common stock for $2.5 billion. Shares are immediately retired upon purchase and the amount of the purchase price over par is allocated on a pro-rata basis, subject to the availability of paid-in capital calculated on a per-share basis, between Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings.\n\nCruise Preferred Shares In March 2022, we acquired SoftBank Vision Fund (AIV M2) L.P.'s (SoftBank) Cruise Class A-1, Class F and Class G  Preferred Shares for $2.1 billion and made an additional $1.35 billion investment in Cruise in place of SoftBank. In December 2024, we acquired Class F and Class G  Preferred Shares from noncontrolling shareholders for an insignificant amount.\n\nCruise Common Shares During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Cruise Holdings issued an insignificant amount, $0.4 billion and $0.8 billion of Class B Common Shares to net settle vested awards under Cruise's 2018 Employee Incentive Plan and issued an insignificant amount, $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion of Class B Common Shares, primarily to us, to fund the payment of statutory tax withholding obligations resulting from the settlement or exercise of vested awards. GM conducted quarterly tender offers and paid approximately $0.2 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.6 billion in cash to purchase tendered Cruise Class B Common Shares during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Class B Common Shares are classified as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements except for certain shares that are liability classified that have a recorded value of approximately $42 million at December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 22 for additional information on Cruise stock incentive awards. In December 2024, we acquired Class E Common Shares from a noncontrolling shareholder for an insignificant amount.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the effect on the equity attributable to us for changes in our ownership interest in Cruise was a decrease in Additional paid-in capital of $0.9 billion and during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was insignificant. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net income attributable to  shareholders  and  transfers  to  the  noncontrolling  interest  in  Cruise  and  other  subsidiaries  were  $7.0  billion,  which  included  a  $1.0  billion  increase  in  equity attributable  to  us,  mainly  due  to  the  redemption  of  Cruise  preferred  shares.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  net  income  attributable  to  shareholders  and transfers  to  the  noncontrolling  interest  in  Cruise  and  other  subsidiaries  were  $10.3  billion.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  net  income  attributable  to shareholders and transfers to the noncontrolling interest in Cruise and other subsidiaries were $9.2 billion, which included a $0.7 billion decrease in equity attributable to us, mainly due to the redemption of Cruise preferred shares.",

Under the terms of the ASR agreements, upon settlement, the Company would either receive additional shares from the financial institution or be required to deliver additional shares or cash to the financial institution.  The Company controlled its election to either deliver additional shares or cash to the financial institution and was subject to provisions which limited the number of shares the Company would be required to deliver.\n\nThe final number of shares received upon settlement of each ASR agreement was determined with reference to the volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock over the term of the ASR agreement.  The initial repurchase of shares under these agreements resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\nThese ASR agreements were accounted for as treasury stock transactions and forward stock purchase contracts.  The par value of the shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock with the remainder recorded as a reduction to capital in excess of par value and accumulated deficit.  The forward stock purchase contracts were considered indexed to the Company's own stock and were classified as equity instruments.",

GM's maximum exposure to loss from its nonconsolidated VIEs, including committed capital contributions, was $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2024.

In contrast, Nike explicitly reported $72 million in stock-based compensation expense related to ESPPs in fiscal year 2023, with no specific disclosure about remaining share capacity. Home Depot structures its compensation across multiple plan types with detailed share allocation rules, while Nike provides more transparent annual expense reporting for ESPPs but less detail on share availability.",

NIKE's strategy centers on maintaining strong U.S. market penetration through product innovation and digital commerce, despite facing risks from changing consumer preferences and competitive pressures.

      "answer": "The 15% minimum tax under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 had no impact on HD's effective tax rate, as stated in its 2023 10-K filing. Similarly, NKE concluded that the tax law changes, including the 15% minimum tax, did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2024. Both companies evaluated the implications of the new tax provision and independently determined that the impact was not material to their financial results.",

HD's facility is larger in borrowing capacity compared to NKE's, but both facilities are central to their liquidity strategies. HD's facility is part of a $5.0 billion back-up credit facility that also includes a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility, indicating a layered approach to liquidity. NKE's $2 billion facility, expandable to $3 billion with lender approval, reflects a more flexible borrowing capacity.

We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we inv est significant resources in training and motiv ating them to maintain a high lev el of job satisfaction. These positions often hav e high turnov er rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitiv e labor market. We hav e faced and may continue to face additional challenges in recruiting and retaining associates due to wage pressure; flexible scheduling needs; health and safety concerns; and challenges related to a remote or hybrid working environment for associates who work in our store support centers. These factors, together with competition among potential employers, hav e resulted in and may continue to result in increased compensation costs, and/or may impair our ability to recruit and retain associates, which could hav e an adv erse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. A limited number of our associates at SRS are represented by labor unions, and we are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our associates from time to time. If successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility and efficiency, and/or otherwise negativ ely impact our operations or reputation.\n\nIn addition, to execute our interconnected retail strategy, including our supply chain inv estments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals, to implement our ongoing technology and other inv estments. The market for these professionals is very competitiv e. An inability to prov ide wages and/or benefits, including remote or hybrid work flexibility, that are competitiv e within the markets in which we operate could adv ersely affect our ability to retain and attract associates.\n\nAdditionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectiv ely motiv ate and retain associates is critical to our business success. If we are unable to attract, dev elop or retain qualified associates, or manage leadership transitions successfully, our ability to effectiv ely manage our strategy may be negativ ely impacted, the quality of serv ice we prov ide to our customers may decrease, and our financial performance may be adv ersely affected.\n\n## A failure of one or more key information technology systems or processes could adversely affect our business, financial results, and reputation.\n\nWe rely extensiv ely on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, use, retain, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data. Some of these systems are managed or prov ided by third-party serv ice prov iders, including certain cloud platform prov iders. In managing our business, we also rely heav ily on the integrity of, security of, and consistent access to, systems that prov ide operational and financial data and capabilities related to sales (both in store and online), customer data, supplier data, associate data, job applicant data, partner data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inv entory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer serv ice, and post-purchase matters. For these information technology systems, applications, and processes to operate effectiv ely, we or our serv ice prov iders must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems, applications or processes, as well as the actions taken to maintain, update, upgrade and patch, could, and on occasion hav e, impaired their operation and effectiv eness or exposed us to security risks. Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact, as well as any systems those third parties utilize, are subject to, and on occasion have experienced, damage, interruption, or malicious activ ity from a number of causes, including power and other critical infrastructure outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer v iruses; data or security breaches; internal or external data theft or misuse; cyberattacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, smishing, v ishing, spyware, denial of serv ice attacks, and ransomware; responsiv e containment measures by us that may inv olv e v oluntarily taking systems offline; natural disasters and catastrophic ev ents such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other extreme weather ev ents; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines; geopolitical or military conflicts, acts of war, terrorism or civ il unrest; other systems outages; inadequate or ineffectiv e redundancy; and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our associates, contractors or third-party serv ice prov iders.

To the extent we, a third party, or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or their information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers' or employees' data or confidential information of the Company stored in or transmitted through such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, a decrease in our ability to retain customers or attract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs (including loss of data or payment for recovery of data) and liabilities, loss of business, loss of business partners and licensees, and the disruption to our supply chain, business, and plans. Unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction, or other compromises are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks using malicious code, vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), system misconfigurations, phishing, deepfakes, ransomware, malware, or social engineering. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are not always complete or sufficiently granular, affecting our ability to fully understand the scope of security breaches.\n\nSuch security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber, and other laws or trigger data breach notification laws, including new disclosure rules promulgated by the SEC, and subject us to private consumer, business partner or licensee, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. These risks also ex ist in acquired businesses, joint ventures, or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems.\n\nSignificant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity problems, recuperate lost data, prevent future compromises, and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment. These include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies, additional security technologies, trainings, personnel, experts, and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, including by interfering with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\n\nMedia or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems, or those of our third-party business partners or service providers, can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies by attackers amplifies these concerns. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services, and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\n\n## We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology (including mobile payments and ordering apps), reloads and loyalty functionality, and various other processes and transactions (including providing Starbucks Digital Solutions to participating licensees), and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Many of our non-store employees continue to work on a remote or hybrid basis, which has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, we continue to expand convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. Any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of these systems could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, the technologies and artificial intelligence tools we are incorporating into certain aspects of our operations may not generate the intended efficiencies and may impact our business results.\n\nWe also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Our systems hardware, software, and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Our contractual and operational safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available.

A continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to our or our competitors' lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job loss, inflation, changes in prevailing interest rates, higher tax es, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy, a global health pandemic, international trade disputes, or geopolitical instability. For ex ample, reductions and continuing volatility in China may be caused by, among other things: changes in consumer spending behaviors, including those caused by a decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions, a decrease in consumer discretionary spending, increasing competition in the market, lowerpriced competitor product offerings, negative economic impacts related to the rising geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan, economic policies or sanctions, heightened data and cybersecurity risks associated with conduct of business in China, and food-safety related matters. We may also experience a reduction or increased volatility in demand for our products in connection with a global health pandemic. Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and could have a material negative impact on our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or enduring changes in behavior that precipitate a more general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability, or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Failure to meet our announced guidance or market expectations for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and increase the volatility of our stock, and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may also impact the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nWe have in the past failed, and may in the future fail, to meet our announced guidance or market expectations, which has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the market price of our stock. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions, which may or may not prove to be correct. Failure to meet our announced guidance or market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, shareholder returns, and expectations regarding the success of our Back to Starbucks plan and related guidance, whether due to our assumptions not being met or the impact of various risks and uncertainties, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.\n\n## Risks Related to Human Capital\n\n## The loss of key personnel, difficulties with recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, or ineffectively managing changes in our workforce could adversely impact our business and financial results.\n\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel and employees. The loss of any of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer or other key senior management personnel, could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees upon whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand.

Our ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market (which has experienced, and may continue to experience, wage inflation and labor shortages), our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners, increased employee turnover, changes in availability of our workforce and a shift toward remote or hybrid work arrangements.

      "answer": "International trade disputes are cited in HD's filing as a potential disruptor to supply chain operations, which could impair inventory availability, increase costs, and lead to lost sales. In SBUX's filing, international trade disputes are listed among several macroeconomic factors that could reduce consumer discretionary spending, particularly in international markets like China. A specific macroeconomic factor highlighted in SBUX's filing is the rising geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan, which could further reduce consumer spending and increase volatility in international markets. This means that trade disputes not only affect physical supply chains (as with HD), but also influence consumer sentiment and spending behavior (as with SBUX), compounding financial risk across different dimensions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from HD's filing - International trade disputes are listed as a specific risk factor that could disrupt supply chain operations, impair inventory delivery, increase costs, and result in lost sales.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to international trade disputes, but in different ways: HD through physical supply chain disruption and SBUX through reduced consumer spending. SBUX specifically highlights rising geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan as a contributing factor to economic volatility, which could exacerbate both supply chain and demand-side risks."

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as 'believes,' 'expects,' 'anticipates,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'seeks,' or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as 'will,' 'should,' 'could,' 'may,' 'aims,' 'intends,' or 'projects,' and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors (many beyond our control) that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience or from our current expectations or projections. Our forward-looking statements, and the risks and uncertainties related thereto, include, but are not limited to, those described under the 'Risk Factors' and 'Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' sections and in other reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'), as well as, among others:\n\n- our ability to preserve, grow, and leverage our brands, including the risk of negative responses by consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns), governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative treatment), or other third parties who object to certain actions taken or not taken by the Company, whose responses could adversely affect our brand value;\n- the impact of our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, pricing strategies, platforms, reformulations, innovations, or customer experience initiatives or investments;\n- the costs and risks associated with, and the successful execution and effects of, our existing and any future business opportunities, expansions, initiatives, strategies, investments, and plans, including our Back to Starbucks plan;\n- changes in consumer preferences, demand, consumption, or spending behavior, including due to shifts in demographic or health and wellness trends, reduction in discretionary spending and price increases, and our ability to anticipate or react to these changes;\n- the ability of our business partners, suppliers, and third-party providers to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments;\n- the potential negative effects of reported incidents involving food- or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, or mislabeling; \u00b7 our ability to open new stores and efficiently maintain the attractiveness of our existing stores;\n- our dependence on the financial performance of our North America operating segment and our increasing dependence on certain international markets;\n- our anticipated operating expenses, including our anticipated total capital expenditures;\n- inherent risks of operating a global business, including changing conditions in our markets, local factors affecting store openings, protectionist trade or foreign investment policies, economic or trade sanctions, compliance with local laws and other regulations, and local labor policies and conditions, including labor strikes and work stoppages;\n- higher costs, lower quality, or unavailability of coffee, dairy, cocoa, energy, water, raw materials, or product ingredients;\n- the potential impact on our supply chain of adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, or significant increases in logistics costs;\n- the ability of our supply chain to meet current or future business needs and our ability to scale and improve our forecasting, planning, production, and logistics management;\n- a worsening in the terms and conditions upon which we engage with our manufacturers and source suppliers, whether resulting from broader local or global conditions or dynamics specific to our relationships with such parties;\n- the impact of unfavorable global or regional economic conditions and related economic slowdowns or recessions, low consumer confidence, high\n- unemployment, weak credit or capital markets, budget deficits, burdensome government debt, austerity measures, higher interest rates, higher taxes, international trade disputes, government restrictions, geopolitical instability, higher inflation, or deflation;\n- failure to meet our announced guidance or market expectations and the impact thereof;\n- failure to attract or retain key executive or partner talent or successfully transition executives;\n- the impacts of partner investments and changes in the availability and cost of labor, including any union organizing efforts and our responses to such efforts;\n- the impact of foreign currency translation, particularly a stronger U.S. dollar;\n- the impact of, and our ability to respond to, substantial competition from new entrants, consolidations by competitors, and other competitive activities, such as pricing actions (including price reductions, promotions, discounting, couponing, or free goods), marketing, category expansion, product introductions, or entry or expansion in our geographic markets;\n- potential impacts of climate change;\n- evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations;\n- the potential impact of activist shareholder actions or tactics;",

In contrast, MCD records GILTI taxes in the provision for income taxes in the year incurred, which also directly impacts its income tax expense but does not specify a separate liability amount.

In contrast, MCD explicitly states that it records GILTI tax in the provision for income taxes in the year it is incurred, suggesting a more predictable and transparent approach to tax planning. This clarity may allow MCD to make more confident cross-border investment decisions without the same level of tax-related risk.

MCD reported a total fair value of RSUs vested in 2023 of $127.2 million. Therefore, BKNG's reclassified gain is significantly larger, being more than double the value of MCD's vested RSUs in 2023.",

      "question": "How do GM and LOW differ in their use of observable market inputs when determining the fair value of Level 2 financial assets and liabilities?",
      "answer": "GM uses quoted prices of similar instruments and foreign exchange and interest rate forward curves as observable market inputs for Level 2 instruments. In contrast, LOW uses benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, and benchmark securities as observable market inputs for Level 2 financial assets and liabilities. Both companies rely on observable market inputs for Level 2 fair value determinations, but the specific inputs differ based on the nature of their respective financial instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GM's 10-K, extract the specific observable market inputs used for Level 2 instruments: 'quoted prices of similar instruments and foreign exchange and interest rate forward curves.'",
        "Step 2: From LOW's 10-K, extract the specific observable market inputs used for Level 2 instruments: 'benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, and benchmark securities.'",
        "Step 3: Compare and contrast the two sets of inputs to identify how each company applies observable market data within its fair value measurement framework for Level 2 assets and liabilities."

Combined, this totals $13.3 billion.

      "answer": "HD is predominantly self-insured for several risk categories including general liability, workers' compensation, and employee group medical, which means it assumes the financial risk of claims directly and could face significant adverse impacts if claims rise. TSLA, on the other hand, acknowledges that it carries less insurance than many peers and often has significant deductibles or exclusions, leaving it exposed to potentially large uninsured losses. Both companies face financial risk from inadequate insurance, but HD\u2019s broader self-insured exposure across multiple categories could lead to more varied and frequent financial impacts, while TSLA\u2019s risk is more concentrated in major incidents that exceed limited policy limits or are entirely uncovered.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From HD's 10-K, extract that HD is predominantly self-insured for general liability, workers' compensation, and employee group medical, with insurance only for catastrophic risks.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize how these differences in self-insurance strategies could lead to different types of financial exposure: HD may face more consistent but potentially manageable costs from routine claims, while TSLA may face less frequent but potentially severe financial impacts from large uninsured losses."

In addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability.\n\n## The inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.\n\nPrices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, natural disasters, and periodic delays in delivery. In addition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other geopolitical conflicts, as well as any related international response, may exacerbate inflationary pressures, including causing increases in commodity prices as well as fuel and other energy costs. Rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices, such as changes in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy, may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.\n\n## We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nWe are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. The occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\n\nGAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, selfinsurance, vendor allowances, tax matters, business combinations, and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments, including due to uncertainty in the current environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process, internal controls, and other changes that could increase our operating costs.\n\nWe are involved in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs.\n\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results. Additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings, as well as compliance with any settlements or consent decrees that result from those proceedings, may involve significant expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the Company.\n\n## Item 1B.

These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.\n\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Warranty reserves include our management's best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products such as Model 3, Model Y and Solar Roof that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\n\n## Our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\n\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\n\nThe terms of certain of our credit facilities, including our senior asset-based revolving credit agreement, contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue guarantees, create liens, repurchase stock, or make other restricted payments, and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\n\n## Additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.\n\nOur business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## We may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\n\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.\n\n## We hold and may acquire digital assets that may be subject to volatile market prices, impairment and unique risks of loss.\n\nIn January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity, allowing us to invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future. Thereafter, we invested certain of such cash in bitcoin and also accepted bitcoin as a form of payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable laws, and suspended this practice in May 2021. We believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and on our view of market and environmental conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## September 2021 Issuance\n\nIn September 2021, we issued three tranches of senior notes.\n\n- The first tranche consisted of $1.0 billion of 1.50% senior notes due September 15, 2028 (the '2028 notes') at a discount of $4 million. Interest on the 2028 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2022.\n- The second tranche consisted of $1.0 billion of 1.875% senior notes due September 15, 2031 (the '2031 notes') at a discount of $6 million. Interest on the 2031 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2022.\n- The third tranche consisted of $1.0 billion of 2.75% senior notes due September 15, 2051 (the '2051 notes') at a discount of $11 million (together with the 2028 notes and the 2031 notes, the 'September 2021 issuance'). Interest on the 2051 notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2022.\n- Issuance costs for the September 2021 issuance totaled $17 million.\n\n## Redemption\n\nAll of our senior notes, other than our outstanding floating rate notes, may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. With respect to the 3.25% 2022 notes and the 5.875% 2036 notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed that would be due after the related redemption date. With respect to all other notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in the notes, holders of all notes have the right to require us to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date.\n\nIn March 2021, we repaid our $1.35 billion 2.00% senior notes that had a maturity date of April 2021.\n\nThe indentures governing the notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\n\n## Maturities of Long-Term Debt\n\nThe following table presents our long-term debt maturities, excluding finance leases, as of January 30, 2022:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## 2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the remaining $422 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes was settled in cash for the par amount and 5.3 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2021 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 5.3 million shares of our common stock during the same period. Additionally, during the second and third quarters of 2021, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 15.8 million shares of our common stock.\n\n## 2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn March 2017, we issued $978 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $966 million.\n\nEach $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is convertible into 15.2670 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $65.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. As of December 31, 2021, holders of the 2022 Notes have the option to convert. Such holders also had the option to convert in each quarter in 2021 due to the closing price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the prior applicable quarter. We have elected to settle the principal in cash and the conversion premium in net shares upon a conversion. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances.\n\nIn accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We recorded to stockholders' equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount was being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%, which is no longer applicable under ASU 2020-06.\n\nIn connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $65.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $131.00 per share. We received $53 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $65.50 to $131.00 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders' equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, $474 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was early converted and settled in cash for the par amount and 6.5 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 6.5 million shares of our common stock during the same period. The related warrants will settle under their terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $439 million.\n\n## 2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.",

      "answer": "Home Depot's financial strategy for solar energy assets is tied to its long-term environmental goal of producing or procuring renewable electricity equivalent to 100% of its facility needs by 2030. This indicates a strategic investment in renewable infrastructure, including on-site solar panels, which would be capitalized and likely depreciated over their useful life as part of store operations. Tesla, on the other hand, reports that its solar energy systems under construction are not depreciated until they are interconnected and placed in service, at which point they are depreciated as solar energy systems in service using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. This shows Tesla treats solar systems as long-term assets only after they are fully operational, aligning with a project-based capitalization and depreciation approach. Therefore, while both companies treat solar infrastructure as long-term assets, Home Depot's approach appears more integrated into ongoing facility operations, whereas Tesla's is tied explicitly to system completion and interconnection.",

In 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often better than other alternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in Arizona, California, Illinois, Ohio and Texas and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer insurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nWe currently offer certain loan and PPA options to residential or commercial customers who pair energy storage systems with solar energy systems. We offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or integrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered to commercial customers, charges a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\n## Manufacturing Facilities in the Bay Area, California\n\nWe manufacture and test our vehicles at our manufacturing facilities in the Bay Area in California, including the Fremont Factory and other local manufacturing facilities. We also manufacture and develop certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards, such as Model S and Model X battery packs and our proprietary lithium-ion battery cells, at these locations.\n\n## Gigafactory Nevada near Reno, Nevada\n\nOur battery material, cell, module and battery pack production for Model 3, Model Y and our energy products are manufactured in one location at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we manufacture vehicle drive units and energy storage components there. Gigafactory Nevada allows us to access high volumes of lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by our partner Panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs. We continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional output there.\n\n## Gigafactory New York in Buffalo, New York\n\nWe use Gigafactory New York for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components and for other functions.\n\n## Gigafactory Shanghai in China\n\nWe established Gigafactory Shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. We continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there. Gigafactory Shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories, as we implemented the learnings from our Model 3 and Model Y ramp at the Fremont Factory to commence and ramp our production at Gigafactory Shanghai quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n## Other Manufacturing\n\nGenerally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase costcompetitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing, including at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Texas in Austin, Texas, which will begin production in 2022.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nOur products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\n\nAs is the case for most automotive companies, most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.",

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2023, Amazon's equity investment in Rivian had a fair value of $3.7 billion. Amazon stated that its investment in Rivian includes a commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles, aligning with its strategic interest in scaling EV adoption for its logistics operations. Meanwhile, GM explicitly outlined its strategic goal to profitably deliver a portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption. While both companies are focused on electric vehicles, Amazon's investment in Rivian supports its own logistics and sustainability goals, while GM aims to achieve profitability through broader consumer adoption. The connection lies in the shared strategic importance of electric vehicles, though the business models and end goals differ between the two companies.",

      "question": "How does the application of the equity method and fair value option differ between AMZN's investment in Rivian and GM's investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and what specific financial impacts are reflected as a result of these accounting choices?",
      "answer": "AMZN holds a 16% ownership interest in Rivian and has the ability to exercise significant influence, yet it elected the fair value option for its equity investment, resulting in a mark-to-market gain of $797 million in 2023, with the investment valued at $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. In contrast, GM uses the equity method for its investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, where it also has significant influence, and reports its proportionate share of earnings as 'Equity income' without consolidating the affiliates\u2019 revenues and expenses. This leads to different financial statement treatments: AMZN reflects valuation gains or losses in 'other income (expense), net,' while GM reflects its share of earnings directly in its income statement as equity income.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMZN's 16% ownership in Rivian, use of fair value option, and $797 million valuation gain in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GM uses the equity method for nonconsolidated affiliates under significant influence, reporting equity income without consolidating revenue or expenses.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies hold significant influence over their investees, but apply different accounting methods (fair value vs equity method), resulting in distinct financial impacts on their income statements."

      "question": "How does the seasonal influence on sales timing for The Home Depot (HD) compare with Starbucks' (SBUX) seasonal revenue patterns, and what implications does this have for their respective fiscal quarter performance in the context of their competition with specialty retailers?",
      "answer": "The Home Depot experiences its highest sales volume in the second fiscal quarter due to seasonal influences tied to home improvement activities in the spring, while Starbucks sees lower revenues and operating income in its second fiscal quarter. This contrast in seasonal performance highlights differing consumer behavior patterns between home improvement retail and specialty coffee retail. For HD, the spring season drives demand, whereas for SBUX, the second fiscal quarter is seasonally weaker, potentially due to reduced foot traffic or shifting consumer spending habits during that time. Both companies must strategically manage their operations and marketing efforts to optimize performance within these seasonal constraints while competing with specialty retailers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - HD's highest sales volume occurs in its second fiscal quarter due to spring season demand.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Starbucks' second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Compare the seasonal patterns of both companies and analyze how these patterns influence their performance relative to specialty retailers."

      "answer": "HD is enhancing its interconnected shopping experience through investments in digital capabilities such as mobile app-enabled store navigation, improved search functionality, and electronic shelf labels, as well as physical store upgrades like self-service lockers and reconfigured service desks. These investments aim to differentiate HD from warehouse clubs by offering a seamless omnichannel experience. In contrast, SBUX focuses on supply chain reliability, emphasizing long-term supplier relationships and farmer support centers to ensure high-quality coffee and dairy supply, which helps maintain product consistency and brand reputation against warehouse clubs offering lower-priced alternatives. HD's strategy carries the risk of high capital expenditure without guaranteed ROI, especially if customers continue shifting toward lower-cost options. SBUX's reliance on stable supplier relationships could be disrupted by external shocks, affecting product availability and margins. Both approaches reflect sector-specific adaptations to the same competitive threat but with different financial risk profiles.",

SBUX similarly identifies international trade disputes as a risk factor that could negatively impact its global supply chain and operating conditions in international markets. However, HD emphasizes its interconnected retail, store, supply chain, and technology initiatives as part of its strategy to manage such disruptions, while SBUX focuses on scaling and improving forecasting, planning, production, and logistics management to address supply chain risks.",

      "question": "How does the difference in store location strategy between HD and SBUX in Iowa reflect their broader approaches to market penetration in rural versus high-traffic areas?",
      "answer": "HD has 10 physical retail stores in Iowa, indicating a more traditional, brick-and-mortar retail strategy in a state that includes significant rural areas. In contrast, SBUX does not specify its store count in Iowa but emphasizes a strategy of locating stores in high-traffic, high-visibility locations, including drive-thru formats that provide convenience. This suggests that while HD focuses on established retail footprints, SBUX prioritizes accessibility and convenience, which may reflect differing market penetration strategies in states like Iowa with a mix of rural and urban demographics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - HD operates exactly 10 stores in Iowa, indicating a fixed retail footprint in the state.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - SBUX focuses on high-traffic, high-visibility locations and drive-thru formats, but does not disclose an exact store count in Iowa.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The explicit store count for HD contrasts with SBUX's lack of disclosure and strategic emphasis on convenience-driven formats, suggesting differing approaches to market presence in a state like Iowa, which has a mix of rural and urban areas."

On the other hand, SBUX's benefits programs, including 100% paid parental leave, mental health services like Headspace and Lyra, and market-specific benefits such as interest-free loans and housing subsidies, support their strategy of being an employer of choice and promoting an inclusive culture.

      "question": "How do changes in import/export regulations impact both Nike's global distribution strategy and Tesla's international vehicle compliance costs, and what are the two companies' respective operational vulnerabilities in adapting to such regulatory shifts?",
      "answer": "Nike faces operational vulnerabilities due to its reliance on global distribution facilities and third-party logistics providers, where changes in import/export regulations could disrupt inventory management, delay sales, and increase compliance costs. Tesla, on the other hand, must navigate varying international vehicle safety, emissions, and certification standards, which require additional investment to ensure compliance across different markets. Both companies are exposed to increased costs and operational complexity due to regulatory divergence, but Tesla also faces delays or restrictions on product availability due to evolving standards for emerging technologies like Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), compounding the financial and strategic risks beyond typical import/export impacts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Nike mentions that changes in U.S. or other countries' trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on its business, including increased costs and operational complexity due to tariffs, quotas, and the need to adapt business practices.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Tesla states that it must meet standards in foreign markets relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy, and emissions that are materially different from U.S. requirements, resulting in additional investment and potential delays in market entry due to foreign regulatory certification processes.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by import/export regulations, but in different ways: Nike through distribution and supply chain compliance, and Tesla through product certification and evolving standards for advanced technologies. The combined vulnerability is in increased compliance costs and operational inflexibility in the face of regulatory shifts."

O ur ability to m eet custom er expectations, m anage inventory, com plete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in em erging m arkets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the developm ent or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the tim ely perform ance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from  our distribution facilities). O ur distribution facilities have in the past and could in the future be interrupted by inform ation technology problem s, disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or governm ent actions taken to m itigate their spread. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. W e maintain business interruption insurance, but it m ay not adequately protect us from  adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\n\nWe are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs a m ultinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and m ust com ply with extensive laws and regulations in the U nited States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our em ployees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to com ply with any of these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furtherm ore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict am ong jurisdictions and com pliance in one jurisdiction m ay result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. W e are involved in various types of claim s, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and governm ent investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our em ployees and representatives, including contractual and em ploym ent relationships, product liability, antitrust, tradem ark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcom e of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgm ents, fines or penalties, or enter into settlem ents of lawsuits and claim s that could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively im pact our reputation. T he global nature of our business m eans legal and com pliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environm ental, com petition, privacy and other regulatory m atters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies have and will continue to arise from  tim e to tim e, which could adversely affect us. I n addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, m ay result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. M oreover, the regulation of certain transactions we engage in, including those involving virtual goods and cryptocurrencies, rem ains in an early stage and subject to significant uncertainty. As a result, we are required to exercise our judgm ent as to whether or how certain laws or regulations apply, or m ay in the future apply, and it is possible that legislators, regulators and courts m ay disagree with our conclusions. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert m anagem ent's attention from  our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\n\nChanges to U.S. or other countries' trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges in the U .S. governm ent's im port and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, em bargoes, safeguards or custom s restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nI n addition, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, m anufacturing, developm ent and investm ent in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. U .S. presidential adm inistrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or term ination of trade agreem ents, the im position of higher tariffs on im ports into the U .S., econom ic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other governm ent regulations affecting trade between the U .S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It m ay be tim e-consum ing and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or com ply with any such changes.\n\nChanges or proposed changes in U .S. or other countries' trade policies m ay result in restrictions and econom ic disincentives on international trade. T ariffs and other changes in U .S. trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governm ents have instituted or are considering im posing retaliatory m easures on certain U .S. goods. F urther, any em erging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the U nited States or in other countries could affect the trade environm ent. The Com pany, sim ilar to m any other m ultinational corporations, does a significant am ount of business that would be im pacted by changes to the trade policies of the U nited States and foreign countries (including governm ental action related to tariffs, international trade agreem ents, or econom ic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely im pact the U.S. econom y or certain sectors thereof or the econom y of another country in which we conduct operations, our industry and the global dem and for our products, and as a result, could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nI n addition, m any of our im ported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods im ported into the U nited States and other countries.

New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\n\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement policy associated with the regulations, continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\n\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require ex tensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where Tesla has a market presence.\n\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.",

On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, it may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of 'program payments' which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at G igafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.\n\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations.\n\n## Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\n\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023, which was achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.",

While both companies comply with the legal requirement under Sarbanes-Oxley to file these certifications attesting to the accuracy of financial statements, Tesla\u2019s structured exhibit referencing (Exhibit 32.1, filed herewith) suggests a more explicit linkage between executive accountability and financial disclosures, potentially indicating stronger governance alignment or a response to prior scrutiny, such as its 2024 clawback policy filing (Exhibit 97). In contrast, NIKE\u2019s less granular reference to Section 1350 Certifications may reflect a more routine approach to regulatory compliance, which could raise questions about the emphasis placed on executive-level financial attestation.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - NIKE references 'Section 1350 Certifications' in a general manner without specifying exhibit number or filing date.",

      "question": "How does the emphasis on food safety and supplier accountability at McDonald's influence its competitive positioning against Starbucks in the quick-service restaurant sector, particularly in relation to menu variety and supply chain reliability?",
      "answer": "McDonald's maintains a rigorous supplier quality management system (SQMS), including third-party audits, a Food Safety Advisory Council, and a Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure food safety and consistency across its global supply chain. This system supports its broad menu variety, including items like the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, and McCaf\u00e9 beverages, which are central to its competitive strategy in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) sector. In contrast, Starbucks emphasizes supply chain reliability through long-term contracts with dairy and coffee suppliers, along with farmer support centers that promote sustainable sourcing and quality improvement. While Starbucks focuses on beverage quality and brand reputation, McDonald's structured food safety and supplier accountability framework allows it to maintain consistency across a more diverse menu, which is a key differentiator in competing within the QSR space.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (MCD_10k_2024.pdf) - McDonald's enforces high food safety standards through its SQMS, third-party audits, and Supplier Code of Conduct, which supports its diverse menu including McCaf\u00e9 beverages and Chicken McNuggets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (SBUX_10k_2024.pdf) - Starbucks ensures supply chain reliability through long-term supplier contracts and farmer support centers, particularly for coffee and dairy, which underpin its beverage-focused offerings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - McDonald's structured food safety and supplier accountability measures enable menu variety and consistency, giving it a competitive edge over Starbucks, which focuses more on beverage quality and brand experience in the QSR segment."

          "chunk_text": "## SUPPLY CHAIN, FOOD SAFE TY AND QUALITY\n\nThe Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment, and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and enforces high food safety and quality standards. The quality management systems and processes involve ongoing product reviews, supplier visits and third-party v erifications with performance expectations. The Company requires periodic third-party food safety audits of suppliers to verify compliance with its food safety and quality standards. The audits help ensure that suppliers are meeting M cDonald's Supplier Quality M anagement System (SQM S) standards. In addition, the Company promotes the consistency of its core menu by regular sensory evaluations and calibration trainings. A  digital transformation project is underway to promote data excellence and continuous measures on quality and food safety performance. A  Food Safety A dvisory Council, comprised of the Company's internal food safety experts as well as suppliers and outside experts, supports the Company's food safety risk management work and provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety and quality. The Company also has ongoing programs to elevate food safety culture throughout the business by educating employees about food safety practices, including proper storage, handling and preparation of food for customers, and conducting trainings for its suppliers and restaurant operators to share best practices on food safety and quality.\n\nThe Company collaborates with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous improvement across its global supply chain. The Company also works closely with suppliers and other third-party experts to drive sustainable sourcing initiatives and to improve the health and welfare of the animals within its supply chain. Led by its Global Chief Supply Chain Officer, the Company has a comprehensive strategy that its global supply chain organization leverages to identify , assess, and manage risk in its supply chain.\n\nTo reinforce the importance of its values, the Company maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to all of its suppliers. The Company expects all of its suppliers to meet the rigorous standards set forth in the Code, which cover areas including human rights, workplace environment, business integrity and environmental management. In addition, the Company has a comprehensive Supplier Workplace Accountability (SWA) program to help suppliers understand its expectations, verify compliance and work toward continuous improvement.\n\n## PRODUCTS\n\nMcDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes.\n\nMcDonald's menu features hamburgers and cheeseburgers, the Big M ac, the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the Filet-O-Fish, and several chicken sandwiches like the M cChicken, M cCrispy and M cSpicy, as well as Chicken M cNuggets, World Famous Fries, shakes, M cFlurry frozen desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, cookies, pies, soft drinks, coffee, M cCaf\u00e9 beverages and other beverages.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include breakfast sandwiches, such as the Egg M cM uffin, Sausage M cM uffin with Egg and M cGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches, oatmeal, hash browns, breakfast burritos and hotcakes.\n\nIn addition to these menu items, restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions.\n\nTaste, quality, choice, value and nutrition are important to customers, and the Company is continuously evolving its menu to meet its customers' needs, including testing new products on an ongoing basis.\n\n## MARKETING\n\nMcDonald's global brand is well known. M arketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed with customers in mind and are focused on promoting the M cDonald's brand and differentiating the Company from its competitors. M arketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience, cultural relevance and the customer experience.\n\n## INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY\n\nThe Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the \"M cDonald's\" trademark and the Golden A rches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. The Company's patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nMcDonald's restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of traditional, fast casual and other food service competitors. The Company measures its competitive position within the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, which is inclusive of the Company's primary competition of quickservice restaurants, but also includes 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, convenience stores, street stalls or kiosks, caf\u00e9s, specialist coffee shops, selfservice cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The Company competes among quick-service restaurants primarily on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety and product quality.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS\n\nThe Company has global operations and is therefore subject to the laws of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. A s discussed under 'Legal Proceedings - Government Regulations' on page 37 of this Form 10-K, governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business, including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, competition, zoning, employment and taxation.\n\nWhile costs associated with legal and regulatory compliance have increased along with the number and scope of laws and regulations affecting our business, these costs are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 6",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields as well as agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\n\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote.\n\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional, and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service, and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\n\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and foodservice accounts and also compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\n\n## Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents, and Domain Names\n\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, and Frappuccino, are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\n\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems, and designs, which have an average remaining duration of approximately thirteen years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including 'Starbucks.com,' 'Starbucks.net,' and 'Starbucksreserve.com.'\n\n## Seasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to, and loaded by, customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Starbucks Cards, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations, and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations, and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.",

Similarly, Starbucks emphasizes that erosion of trust in its brand due to perceived failures in achieving environmental and social program goals could lead to negative publicity, litigation, boycotts, and ultimately, a decline in sales and financial performance.

Governmental responses to health epidemics or pandemics, including operational restrictions and temporary restaurant closures, can also affect the foregoing items and adversely affect our business and financial results. The duration and scope of a health epidemic or pandemic can be difficult to predict and depends on many factors, including the emergence of new variants and the availability, acceptance and effectiveness of preventative measures. A  health epidemic or pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, those related to the availability and costs of labor and commodities, supply chain interruptions, consumer behavior, and consumer perceptions of our brand and industry.\n\n## Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe profitability  of our Company-owned and operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supplies, fuel and utilities, as well as distribution and other operating costs, including labor. V olatility in certain commodity prices and fluctuations in labor costs have adversely affected and in the future could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand and other macroeconomic conditions, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls, government regulation, and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, all of which are bey ond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. Our System can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\n\n## A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability.\n\nOur credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. A s a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, our collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders were to impose new operating or financial covenants.\n\nOur operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. A ny such events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n## The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.\n\nMany factors affect the trading volatility  and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. These factors, many of which are beyond our control, include the following:\n\n- the unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions;\n- governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the U.S., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic, trade or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;\n- trading activity  in our common stock, in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or in our debt securities, which can be affected by: market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our common stock by significant shareholders; and trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which M cDonald's may be included, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial A verage;\n- the impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and\n- the impact of corporate actions, including changes to our corporate structure, and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, including those we may take from time to time as we implement our business strategies in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations.\n\n## Our business is subject to an increasing focus on environmental and social impact matters.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing focus by stakeholders - including employees, franchisees, customers, suppliers, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and investors - on environmental and social impact matters. A  failure, whether real or perceived, to address environmental and social impact matters or to achieve progress on our environmental and social impact initiatives on the anticipated timing or at all, could adversely affect our business, including by heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as those related to consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand, labor availability  and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, and legal and regulatory complexity. Conversely, our taking a position, whether real or perceived, on environmental and social impact, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters could also adversely impact our business.\n\nThe standards we set for ourselves regarding environmental and social impact matters, and our ability to meet such standards, may also impact our business. For example, we are working to manage risks and costs to our System related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources, and we have announced initiatives relating to, among other things, climate action, sustainability, and responsible sourcing. In addition, we are engaging in social impact initiatives, including community engagement and philanthropy; as well as our commitment to inclusion. We have faced increased scrutiny related to reporting on and achieving these initiatives, as well as continued public focus on similar matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. We have also experienced increased pressure from stakeholders to provide expanded disclosure and establish additional commitments, targets or goals, and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to additional market, operational, execution and reputational costs and risks.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand E xecution\n\n## Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands, and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\nWe believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience, and for our global environmental and social impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.\n\nErosion of trust in our brand value can be caused by isolated or recurring incidents originating both from us or our business partners, or from external events. Such incidents can potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability, which can have a negative impact on our financial results. Incidents that can erode trust in our brand value include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, safety-related incidents, or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons), or if they result in litigation. Negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about Starbucks, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate negative publicity about Starbucks across media channels that could damage the value of our brand. It may be difficult to address such negative publicity, including as a result of fictitious media content (such as content produced by generative artificial intelligence or bad actors) across media channels. Additionally, consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees, or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal, inequitable, or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content, or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees, including our responses to unionization efforts, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights, are failing to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, or are aligned with positions on social or geopolitical issues could also negatively impact our brand value. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions, fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer ex perience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees who represent the brand well, or fail to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished. In addition, we cannot ensure that our store partners, licensees, or other business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand.\n\nFurthermore, if we are not effective in making sufficient progress toward our environmental and social program goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer, and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation. The ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on making sufficient progress toward our environmental and social program goals, each of which requires company-wide coordination and alignment. Increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on environmental sustainability matters, including climate change, diminishing energy and water resources, packaging and waste, deforestation, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and land use, may result in increased pressure to set goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational, and execution costs or risks. Statements regarding our environmental and social program goals reflect our current plans and aspirations; our environmental and social program-related policies, practices, and goals are voluntary, challenging, and subject to change at our discretion. Some third parties may object to the scope or nature of our environmental and social program initiatives or goals, or any revisions to these initiatives or goals, which could give rise to negative responses by governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative treatment), consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns), or other third parties that could adversely affect our brand value.\n\n## We may not be successful in our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, and pricing strategies.\n\nOur continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, and pricing strategies to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly marketing, promotional, and advertising environment. Competition to attract and retain high-quality marketing partners and endorsers has increased. Our decisions to collaborate or to cease collaborating with certain endorsers or marketing partners in light of actions taken or statements made by them could seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our marketing, promotional, and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching consumers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional, and marketing resources across different channels, including digital, allows us to effectively and efficiently reach consumers in ways that are meaningful to them. Additionally, many factors, including operating costs, constraints, or changes, and our current and future competitors' pricing",

If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies - including the components of our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy - must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's continued ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development;\n- innovate and differentiate the M cDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- build upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including building one of the world's largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement;\n- run great restaurants by building the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform which enables franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently  and utiliz e the latest cloud-based technology  to make it easier for crews to deliv er ex ceptional customer service;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and\n- evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, if the execution of our strategies proves to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at M cDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, as well as by our perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.\n\nIf we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 28",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand E xecution\n\n## Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands, and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\nWe believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience, and for our global environmental and social impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.\n\nErosion of trust in our brand value can be caused by isolated or recurring incidents originating both from us or our business partners, or from external events. Such incidents can potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability, which can have a negative impact on our financial results. Incidents that can erode trust in our brand value include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, safety-related incidents, or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons), or if they result in litigation. Negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about Starbucks, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate negative publicity about Starbucks across media channels that could damage the value of our brand. It may be difficult to address such negative publicity, including as a result of fictitious media content (such as content produced by generative artificial intelligence or bad actors) across media channels. Additionally, consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees, or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal, inequitable, or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content, or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees, including our responses to unionization efforts, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights, are failing to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, or are aligned with positions on social or geopolitical issues could also negatively impact our brand value. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions, fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer ex perience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees who represent the brand well, or fail to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished. In addition, we cannot ensure that our store partners, licensees, or other business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand.\n\nFurthermore, if we are not effective in making sufficient progress toward our environmental and social program goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer, and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation. The ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on making sufficient progress toward our environmental and social program goals, each of which requires company-wide coordination and alignment. Increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on environmental sustainability matters, including climate change, diminishing energy and water resources, packaging and waste, deforestation, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and land use, may result in increased pressure to set goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational, and execution costs or risks. Statements regarding our environmental and social program goals reflect our current plans and aspirations; our environmental and social program-related policies, practices, and goals are voluntary, challenging, and subject to change at our discretion. Some third parties may object to the scope or nature of our environmental and social program initiatives or goals, or any revisions to these initiatives or goals, which could give rise to negative responses by governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative treatment), consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns), or other third parties that could adversely affect our brand value.\n\n## We may not be successful in our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, and pricing strategies.\n\nOur continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, and pricing strategies to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly marketing, promotional, and advertising environment. Competition to attract and retain high-quality marketing partners and endorsers has increased. Our decisions to collaborate or to cease collaborating with certain endorsers or marketing partners in light of actions taken or statements made by them could seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our marketing, promotional, and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching consumers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional, and marketing resources across different channels, including digital, allows us to effectively and efficiently reach consumers in ways that are meaningful to them. Additionally, many factors, including operating costs, constraints, or changes, and our current and future competitors' pricing",

      "answer": "Starbucks (SBUX) faces boycott-related risks that could harm its reputation, business, and financial performance if stakeholders or consumers perceive its ESG-related initiatives or goals as inadequate or misleading. These risks are tied to reputational damage, stakeholder backlash, and potential consumer boycotts, which may directly reduce product sales and damage brand equity. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) identifies geopolitical tensions as a key risk factor that could disrupt its international operations, particularly in developing markets with political instability, economic volatility, and social unrest. These disruptions may lead to supply chain interruptions, increased costs, and reduced revenues, especially in regions where franchisees struggle to maintain operations. While both companies operate in the consumer discretionary sector and face external risks that could harm their financial and reputational standing, the nature of these risks differs: SBUX's risks are primarily tied to stakeholder and consumer perceptions of corporate responsibility, whereas MCD's risks stem from macro-level geopolitical and operational challenges in international markets.",

          "chunk_text": "or volatility  can also result from acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. The broader impact of acts of war and related sanctions, including on macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical tensions, consumer demand and the ability of us and our franchisees to operate in certain geographic areas, may also have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\nWhile we may face challenges and uncertainties in any of the markets in which we operate, such challenges and uncertainties are often heightened in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. A n inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure a reliable and sufficient supply of quality products, equipment and other materials on favorable terms. A lthough many of these items are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain items have limited suppliers, which increases our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases have in the past and may in the future adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, inflationary pressures, unexpected increases in demand, transportation-related issues, labor-related issues, technology-related issues, weather-related events, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control or that of our suppliers or franchisees. Interruptions in our System's supply chain or ineffective contingency planning can increase our costs, impact ingredient quality, delay new restaurant openings, and/or limit the quality  or av ailability  of products, equipment and other materials that are critical to our Sy stem's operations or to restaurant development.\n\n## Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-owned and operated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. If franchisee sales trends worsen, or any of such risks materialize or intensify, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors, including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.\n\n## Continued challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nOur success depends in part on our System's ability to effectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in M cDonald's restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. We and our franchisees have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in adequately staffing certain M cDonald's restaurants, which can negatively impact operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System's ability to meet its labor needs as they evolve is generally subject to a variety of factors, including the availability  of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.\n\nFurther, our System has experienced increased costs and competition associated with attracting, recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at M cDonald's restaurants. We and our franchisees also continue to be impacted by increasingly complex U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting our respective workforces. These laws and regulations are increasingly focused on, and in certain cases impose requirements with respect to, employment matters such as wages and hours, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Such laws and regulations can expose us and our franchisees to increased costs and other effects of compliance, including potential liability, and all such labor and compliance costs could have a negative impact on our Company-owned and operated margins and franchisee profitability.\n\nOur potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. A dditionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to attract, recruit, dev elop, motiv ate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.",

Previously reported data may in the future be adjusted to reflect improvements in the availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations, and other changes in circumstances. If our ESG-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth could be adversely affected. If we are unable to meet our ESG-related goals, commitments, initiatives, or evolving stakeholder or industry expectations and standards, if we change or are perceived to have changed our goals, commitments, or initiatives, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to stakeholder interests in ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business, or financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we could be criticized by shareholders, stakeholders, regulators, or other interested parties for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals. We have been and could continue to be subject to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) targeting Starbucks, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth.\n\n## Certain activist shareholder actions have caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and adversely impact our stock price.\n\nWe actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, has resulted in, and could in the future result in, substantial costs, such as legal fees and ex penses, and the diversion of management's and our Board's attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our customers, partners, licensees, or business partners, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Activists or other shareholders holding a large portion of our outstanding shares will also have the ability to ex ert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers, acquisitions, and other significant business transactions, shareholder proposals, and amendments to our governing documents. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation\n\n## Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.\n\nOur policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules, and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption, and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. For example, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators may also shift the impact of applicable regulations on the business and the costs necessary to ensure compliance therewith, including through an expansion in the nature, scope, or complexity of matters on which we are required to report. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including expanded or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital ex penditures, incremental investments, and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Other ex amples of emerging and potentially relevant requirements are import tariffs and restrictions grounded in, among other things, alleged human rights abuses.\n\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux, and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies, or result in the possibility of fines, litigation, or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and",

The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. If franchisee sales trends worsen, or any of such risks materialize or intensify, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors, including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.\n\n## Continued challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nOur success depends in part on our System's ability to effectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in M cDonald's restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. We and our franchisees have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in adequately staffing certain M cDonald's restaurants, which can negatively impact operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System's ability to meet its labor needs as they evolve is generally subject to a variety of factors, including the availability  of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.\n\nFurther, our System has experienced increased costs and competition associated with attracting, recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at M cDonald's restaurants. We and our franchisees also continue to be impacted by increasingly complex U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting our respective workforces. These laws and regulations are increasingly focused on, and in certain cases impose requirements with respect to, employment matters such as wages and hours, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Such laws and regulations can expose us and our franchisees to increased costs and other effects of compliance, including potential liability, and all such labor and compliance costs could have a negative impact on our Company-owned and operated margins and franchisee profitability.\n\nOur potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. A dditionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to attract, recruit, dev elop, motiv ate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.",

There can be no assurance that our suppliers will be able to accommodate our anticipated growth or continue to supply current quantities at preferential prices or at all. An inability of our suppliers to provide products in a timely or cost-effective manner could impair our growth and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. If we are unable to accurately forecast sales levels in each market or store and obtain sufficient ingredients or produce a sufficient supply to meet demand, we may incur higher expedited shipping costs and may temporarily run out of stock of certain products, which could negatively impact the enthusiasm of our customers and store partners. We have been, and may in the future be, unable to fully address consumers' demand for our products, particularly in the case of new offerings for which demand is higher than projected. Conversely, if demand does not meet our expectations, we have incurred, and could continue to incur, increased inventory write-offs. Finally, if we are unable to scale and improve our forecasting, planning, production, and logistics management, we could frustrate our customers, lose sales, or diminish our brand reputation.\n\n## Interruption of our supply chain and our reliance on suppliers could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.\n\nAny material interruption in our supply chain (such as material disruption of roasted coffee supply), whether due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions (such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, or customs restrictions), pandemics, social or labor unrest, labor shortages, natural disasters, or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. Additionally, our food, beverage, and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations and, in certain cases, are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers to provide high-quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies, or which are experiencing political instability, labor discord, disruption or shortages, or social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.\n\n## Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\n\n## Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are largely outside our control.\n\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations:\n\n- increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets;\n- disruptions to our supply chain;\n- changes in climate, including changes to the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, that impact the price and availability or cost of goods and services, energy, and other materials throughout our supply chain;\n- changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation;\n- adverse outcomes of litigation;\n- inflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates;\n- severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily or for extended periods of time affect our retail business in such markets;\n- government shutdowns or the risk of government shutdowns, as well as the impact or expected impact of elections, both in the U.S. and in other markets around the world;\n- especially in our largest markets, including the U.S. and China, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-",

      "answer": "HD operates over 500 warehouses and distribution centers that are subject to ground leases, indicating a significant scale of facilities under this leasing model. In contrast, MCD utilizes ground leases across its real estate portfolio but focuses on long-term lease structures, typically 20 years with rent escalations and renewal options that provide the company with discretion to extend. These differences highlight that HD emphasizes the operational scale of its leased facilities, while MCD focuses on the structural terms and long-term stability of its ground leases.",

As part of this transformation, HD has modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes. MCD, on the other hand, is implementing a comprehensive, multi-year technology and operating model transformation across multiple areas of the business to modernize processes and create efficiencies. This includes the implementation of new systems and centralizing or outsourcing certain routine functions. MCD has modified certain processes and procedures to enhance the quality of internal control over financial reporting and will continue to monitor and modify key control activities to align with updated business processes and new financial systems. Both companies are proactively adjusting controls in response to transformation efforts, but MCD emphasizes enhancement of control quality while HD focuses on continued system migration and control design adjustments.",

This results in these amounts being recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.\n\nFor all share-based payment awards, the expense recognized has been adjusted for estimated forfeitures where the requisite service is not expected to be met.  Estimated forfeiture rates are developed based on the Company's analysis of historical forfeiture data for homogeneous employee groups.\n\nGeneral terms and methods of valuation for the Company's share-based awards are as follows:\n\n## Stock Options\n\nStock options have terms of 10 years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years, subsequent to the date of the grant, and are assigned an exercise price equal to the closing market price of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Options are expensed on a straight-line basis over the grant vesting period, which is considered to be the requisite service period.\n\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  When determining expected volatility, the Company considers the historical volatility of the Company's stock price, as well as implied volatility.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options' ex pected term.  The ex pected term of the options is based on the Company's evaluation of option holders' exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options are ex pected to remain unexercised.  The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.  The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and weighted-average grant date fair value for options granted in 2024, 2023, and 2022 are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Shipping delays impact Lowe\u2019s and Nike differently due to variations in their supply chain structures and sourcing geographies. Lowe\u2019s, which sources a large percentage of its private and national brand merchandise from China and Mexico, faces increased costs due to tariffs and trade policy changes, which can lead to higher product costs and potential consumer demand suppression. These delays also strain their fulfillment network, increasing delivery costs and risking lost sales due to out-of-stocks. Nike, on the other hand, experiences shipping delays due to its reliance on overseas manufacturing, particularly for raw materials and finished products. These delays have forced Nike to use more expensive transportation methods like air freight, directly affecting profit margins. Both companies are exposed to port congestion and labor issues, but the financial impact manifests differently: Lowe\u2019s through merchandise cost increases and sales disruption, and Nike through higher transportation costs and production delays.",

We source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Catastrophic events, extreme weather conditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global supply chain. For example, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and international supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past, due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.\n\nWe source, both directly and indirectly, a portion of the products we sell from foreign manufacturers, with China and Mexico being the dominant import sources. Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries, such as China and Mexico, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which represents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other countries have responded by changing their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. Complications in the free movement of goods in North America, an escalation of tariff activity elsewhere in the world or changes to existing free trade agreements, like the United StatesMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), could adversely impact our financial results. Increased import tariffs and other changes in trade policy could also negatively impact consumer demand for the products we sell. In addition to the potential direct impacts of increased tariff activity, longer term macroeconomic consequences could result, including slower growth, inflation, and higher interest rates. The degree of our ex posure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays and disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and ex clusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters.\n\nAdditionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex  and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs, or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.\n\nWe continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing customer needs. These investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and optimization while leveraging a market delivery model. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with implementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing thirdparty service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. Our investments to enhance and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",

Any negative sentim ent toward the U nited States as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business.\n\nI n addition, terrorist acts, m ilitary conflict and disease outbreaks have increased the risks of doing business abroad. T hese factors, am ong others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure m aterials, or our costs for m anufacturing and procuring m aterials, our ability to im port products, our ability to sell products in international m arkets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors m ake the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or im practical, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal m aterials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic com pounds, foam  cushioning m aterials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane film s - are locally available to m anufacturers. T he principal m aterials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized perform ance fabrics designed to efficiently wick m oisture away from  the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and m etal hardware - are also available in countries where our m anufacturing takes place. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our contract m anufacturers to locate, train, em ploy and retain adequate personnel. N IKE  contract m anufacturers and m aterials suppliers buy raw m aterials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentim es regulated by the governm ents of the countries in which our products are m anufactured.\n\nThere could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw m aterials from  current sources or, in the event of a disruption or heightened com petition for such m aterials, our contract m anufacturers m ight not be able to locate alternative suppliers of m aterials of com parable quality at an acceptable price or at all. F urther, our contract m anufacturers have experienced and m ay continue to experience in the future, unexpected closures, unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards, whether governm ent mandated or otherwise, and increases in com pliance costs due to governm ental regulation concerning certain m etals, fabrics or raw m aterials used in the m anufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that m anufacturers that we do not contract and that we refer to as \"unaffiliated m anufacturers\" will be able to fill our orders in a tim ely manner. If we experience significant increases in dem and, or reductions in the availability of m aterials, or need to replace an existing contract m anufacturer or m aterials supplier, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw m aterials or additional m anufacturing capacity will be available when required on term s acceptable to us, or at all, or that any contract m anufacturer, unaffiliated m anufacturer, or any m aterials supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to m eet our requirem ents. E ven if we are able to expand existing or find new m anufacturing capacity or sources of m aterials, we m ay encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the tim e it takes to train suppliers and m anufacturers in our m ethods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. In addition, changes we m ake in m anaging the supply of our products, such as changes to decrease the supply of certain products, pose the risk that we m ay not be able to m eet dem and for, or ram p up production of, certain products tim ely or without additional cost. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, in the supply of m aterials or in the m anufacturing of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to m eet retail custom er and consum er dem and for our products and result in lower revenues and net incom e both in the short- and long-term .\n\nBecause contract m anufacturers m ake a m ajority of our products outside of our principal sales m arkets, our products m ust be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. D elays in the shipm ent or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, container shortages, labor shortages, including work stoppages or port strikes, infrastructure and port congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between m anufacturers, have adversely im pacted, and could in the future adversely im pact the availability of our products and, in turn, our financial perform ance. In addition, delays in the shipm ent or delivery of our products, m anufacturing delays or unexpected dem and for our products have required us, and m ay in the future require us to use faster, but m ore expensive, transportation m ethods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit m argins.

In contrast, NKE does not directly link trade policy changes to financial exposure. Instead, NKE highlights risks related to IT vulnerabilities, noting that failures in its information technology systems\u2014used across supply chain, retail operations, and digital commerce\u2014could cause delays in product fulfillment, reduce operational efficiency, and materially affect its digital commerce business growth. While LOW's exposure is tied directly to trade policy and supply chain cost increases, NKE's risks are more internally operational and technology-dependent, with potential disruptions affecting customer experience, digital sales, and global commerce scalability.",

We source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Catastrophic events, extreme weather conditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global supply chain. For example, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and international supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past, due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.\n\nWe source, both directly and indirectly, a portion of the products we sell from foreign manufacturers, with China and Mexico being the dominant import sources. Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries, such as China and Mexico, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which represents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other countries have responded by changing their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. Complications in the free movement of goods in North America, an escalation of tariff activity elsewhere in the world or changes to existing free trade agreements, like the United StatesMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), could adversely impact our financial results. Increased import tariffs and other changes in trade policy could also negatively impact consumer demand for the products we sell. In addition to the potential direct impacts of increased tariff activity, longer term macroeconomic consequences could result, including slower growth, inflation, and higher interest rates. The degree of our ex posure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays and disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and ex clusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters.\n\nAdditionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex  and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs, or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.\n\nWe continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing customer needs. These investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and optimization while leveraging a market delivery model. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with implementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing thirdparty service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. Our investments to enhance and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",

Over a num ber of years, we have im plem ented Inform ation Technology System s in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. O ur work to integrate, secure and enhance these system s and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and N IKE  will continue to invest in these efforts. W e cannot provide assurance, however, that the m easures we take to secure and enhance these system s will be sufficient to protect our Inform ation T echnology System s and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or inform ation loss.

The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work on-site for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days, may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. We also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees.\n\n## Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States or foreign employment regulations.\n\nWe have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which could have a direct impact on our operating costs. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs. There is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws, criminal activity, personal injury and other claims. In addition, if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we could be vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Operating a Global Business\n\n## Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.\n\nVirtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political tensions, unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. Changes in the U.S. government's import and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards or customs restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as the anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, independent contractors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films - are locally available to manufacturers.

These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions, which are a series of inspiring talks with thought leaders to help partners understand how to bring the Starbucks Experience to life, include a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback and effective engagement with customers and communities. To help further promote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage U.S.-based partners to enroll in the To Be Welcoming courses we created in partnership with Arizona State University to address different forms of bias and discrimination.\n\n## Pay Equity\n\nTo be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners.\n\nWe previously achieved and currently maintain 100 percent pay equity in the U.S. for women and men and people of all races for partners performing similar work. We have also achieved gender pay equity in China and Canada, two of our largest markets outside of the U.S., and we made a commitment to achieve gender pay equity in all company-operated markets. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles which provide equal footing, transparency and accountability as best practices that help address known, systemic barriers to global pay equity.\n\nAs of October 2, 2022, Starbucks employed approximately 402,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 258,000 people, with approximately 248,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 144,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 140,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. Some Starbucks partners in company-operated stores are represented by unions, though it is an immaterial portion of our total workforce. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by a strong Starbucks culture and a good relationship between the company and our partners.\n\n## Information about our Executive Officers\n\n",

      "answer": "Nike implemented a tax restructuring by onshoring non-U.S. intangible property, which increased the likelihood of future U.S. taxation under Subpart F but resulted in a 4.7% non-cash deferred income tax benefit by establishing a future tax deduction. In contrast, Starbucks explicitly states that it classifies taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense, without mentioning a proactive restructuring to mitigate future GILTI tax exposure. This indicates that Nike pursued a forward-looking tax planning strategy to reduce future taxable income, while Starbucks appears to be recognizing GILTI tax liabilities as incurred without a similar restructuring disclosed.",

        "Step 1: From Nike's 10-K, extract the 4.7% non-cash deferred income tax benefit and the restructuring involving onshoring of non-U.S. intangible property to reduce future U.S. taxation under Subpart F.",

The Company recognizes taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 was lower than the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a shift in the Company's earnings mix and recognition of a non-cash, one-time benefit related to the onshoring of the Company's non-U.S. intangible property. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company onshored certain non-U.S. intangible property ownership rights and implemented changes in the Company's legal entity structure. The tax restructuring increases the possibility that foreign earnings in future periods will be subject to tax in the U.S. due to Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company recognized a deferred tax asset and corresponding non-cash deferred income tax benefit of 4.7%, to establish the deferred tax deduction that is expected to reduce taxable income in future periods.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nWe routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available.\n\nStarbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax balances on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income ('GILTI') provisions are applied, providing an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made a policy election to classify taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met.\n\n## Common Stock Share Repurchases\n\nWe may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings (deficit).\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact to our financial statements.\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a new methodology that reflects current expected credit losses on financial assets, including receivables and available-for-sale securities. The new methodology requires entities to estimate and recognize expected credit losses each reporting period. The guidance was adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 under the modified retrospective approach and resulted in a $2.2 million transition adjustment to opening shareholders' retained deficit on our consolidated statements of equity.",

We also have Employee Networks, collectively known as NikeUNITED, representing various employee groups.\n\nOur DE&amp;I focus extends beyond our workforce and includes our communities, which we support in a number of ways. We have committed to investments that aim to address racial inequality and improve diversity and representation in our communities. We also are leveraging our global scale to accelerate business diversity, including investing in business training programs for women and increasing the proportion of services supplied by minority-owned businesses.\n\n## COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n\nNIKE's total rewards are intended to be competitive and equitable, meet the diverse needs of our global teammates and reinforce our values.

We have continued to follow and communicate guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local public health authorities, as well as mandates set by state and local law as a part of our continued response and focus on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We developed a comprehensive risk assessment, infection control plans, and employee education campaigns. Our robust health and safety measures have included staffing a team of fully dedicated contact tracers, sourcing and distributing over 1 million NIKE face coverings to teammates worldwide, facilitating access to COVID-19 testing, and offering on-site vaccination clinics in collaboration with local public health agencies. As the pandemic continues, we continue to strongly encourage that all employees become fully vaccinated. We continue to support our employees by offering all eligible employees paid COVID-19 sick leave for two weeks, in addition to existing paid time off benefits and legally mandated sick leave programs, which covers physical health, mental and emotional well-being and care for a family member.

Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergency, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n- Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nFailure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, and expectations regarding the success of our Reinvention Plan and related guidance, environmental performance and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.\n\n## Risks Related to COVID-19\n\n- Our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business and results of operations. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, many of our company-operated and licensed stores were closed. For stores that remained open, same-store sales declined due to modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic. While nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores have reopened, we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the virus. Our China market experienced unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change, and whether such change is temporary or permanent. Social distancing, telecommuting and reductions in travel may become the new normal. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions about precautionary measures, such as vaccinations, showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings, that could impact our results, including by impacting our brand, our employee retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to buy our products. All of these conditions could fundamentally impact the way we work and the services we provide, and could have continuing adverse effects on our financial performance. As a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets-and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited-any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results.\n\nProlonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer.\n\nOur global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints, adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance (including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), labor shortages and other factors.

For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our Information Technology Systems and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or information loss. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the increased use of employee-owned devices for communications as well as work-from-home arrangements, such as those implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, present additional operational risks to our Information Technology Systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyber-attacks. Further, like other companies in the retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future.\n\nWe also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.\n\n## We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.\n\nWe currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.\n\nWe also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 16",

Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergency, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n- Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nFailure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, and expectations regarding the success of our Reinvention Plan and related guidance, environmental performance and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.\n\n## Risks Related to COVID-19\n\n- Our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business and results of operations. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, many of our company-operated and licensed stores were closed. For stores that remained open, same-store sales declined due to modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic. While nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores have reopened, we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the virus. Our China market experienced unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change, and whether such change is temporary or permanent. Social distancing, telecommuting and reductions in travel may become the new normal. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions about precautionary measures, such as vaccinations, showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings, that could impact our results, including by impacting our brand, our employee retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to buy our products. All of these conditions could fundamentally impact the way we work and the services we provide, and could have continuing adverse effects on our financial performance. As a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets-and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited-any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results.\n\nProlonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer.\n\nOur global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints, adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance (including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), labor shortages and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices.",

      "answer": "NIKE reports that its three largest international customers (which include licensees among other types of partners) accounted for approximately 14% of total non-U.S. sales, but does not isolate licensee revenue specifically. In contrast, Starbucks explicitly quantifies revenue from licensees at $435 million, linking it directly to pandemic recovery and market conversion such as in Korea.

Additionally, there were 765 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 11% increase over the past 12 months ($406 million). Also contributing to the increase was the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). These were partially offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales ($459 million), driven by a 5% decrease in customer transactions and a 4% decrease in average ticket, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China and lapping the prior-year value-added-tax benefit in China, unfavorable foreign currency translation ($436 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($127 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2022 decreased 33% to $833.2 million, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021.

Considering the specific third-party arrangements described, how do these distinct partnership strategies reflect different operational priorities for each company, and what specific financial or strategic outcomes are each company aiming to achieve through these partnerships?",
      "answer": "BKNG partners with a third party to conduct cybersecurity risk assessments every two years, aiming to measure the maturity of its security and privacy programs against NIST frameworks. This supports strategic oversight by the Board and Cybersecurity Subcommittee and ensures alignment with risk tolerance levels. In contrast, LOW partners with a third party to operate a supplier finance program, which allows suppliers to finance payment obligations at favorable rates, thereby increasing their working capital flexibility while enabling LOW to capture savings in pricing, payment terms, or vendor funding. These partnerships reflect BKNG's focus on governance and risk management, and LOW's focus on supply chain efficiency and financial optimization.",

These tools are central to BKNG's strategy of providing seamless, personalized travel experiences, which contributed to $21.4 billion in revenues for 2023. In contrast, LOW sells physical tools as part of its home improvement offerings, which are supported by services like installation and protection plans. Tools are one of several product categories under LOW\u2019s broader retail strategy, which includes seasonal sales cycles and intellectual property like the Kobalt brand.

      "answer": "BKNG faces increased compliance costs and potential fines due to its role in payment processing, particularly as it scales globally and must adhere to evolving regulations like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Failure to comply could result in penalties, increased transaction costs, or restrictions on accepting payment cards, directly harming its profit margins and operational flexibility. LOW, on the other hand, is exposed to financial liability and operational disruption if its systems or those of its third-party providers are breached, which could lead to remediation costs, litigation, and reputational damage. Both companies face PCI DSS-related financial and operational risks, but BKNG's exposure is more compliance and transaction cost-driven, while LOW's is more breach and fraud event-driven.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from BKNG's filing - BKNG notes that PCI DSS compliance may result in increased compliance costs, fines, or increased payment card transaction costs, which could adversely impact profit margins.",
        "Step 2: Extract from LOW's filing - LOW states that a breach could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, liability, litigation, and reputational damage, while also increasing costs to protect against such risks.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to PCI DSS, but BKNG's risk centers on compliance costs and transactional penalties, while LOW's risk focuses on breach-related financial and reputational fallout."

      "answer": "For Home Depot, pandemic-driven demand fluctuations led to higher out-of-stock inventory positions and delays in delivering products to customers due to disruptions in the supply chain, which could adversely impact profitability and financial condition. For McDonald's, similar supply chain interruptions could increase costs or reduce revenues, particularly because of the global scope of its operations and reliance on international suppliers. Both companies experienced supply chain challenges, but Home Depot's issues were more inventory and fulfillment-focused, while McDonald's faced broader international operational complexities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Home Depot faced higher out-of-stock inventory positions and delivery delays due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - McDonald's faced supply chain interruptions that could increase costs or reduce revenues, particularly due to its global operations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies experienced supply chain challenges due to pandemic-driven demand fluctuations, but the nature and scope of the impacts differed based on their operational structures."

These issues, which may continue or expand depending on the progression of the pandemic, are placing strain on the domestic and international supply chain, which has affected and may continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products. Customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock inventory positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products to our distribution and fulfillment centers, stores or customers. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition. Similarly, increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations, as well as those of our third-party carriers, resulting in delays in delivering products to customers. The operation of our distribution and fulfillment centers is crucial to our business operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, labor shortages at and temporary closures of some of our distribution and fulfillment centers, and any such labor shortages or closures, whether temporary or sustained, may adversely impact the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers. Any of these circumstances could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and related recovery efforts continue to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy and/or to adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section and other SEC filings, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand and reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\n\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies, and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations have become increasingly complex. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data privacy and cybersecurity; the sale, marketing, sourcing, and pricing of some of our products; transportation, logistics and interstate delivery operations, including Department of Transportation regulations on vehicles and drivers; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes, including changes to corporate tax rates; restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; competition and antitrust requirements; ESG performance, transparency and reporting; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our sales, operations or profitability.\n\n## If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political, social and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; international trade disputes, trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; limitations on access to ports; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; compliance with forced labor laws; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. For example, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. As a portion of our retail products are sourced, directly or indirectly, outside of the U.S., major changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and profitability of retail product sales in our U.S. locations.",

Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System's ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.\n\nDisruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers' operations, and asset seizures. Trade policies, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries could adversely affect our business and operations. These and other government actions may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nWe may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, the U.K.'s exit from the European Union has caused increased regulatory complexities and uncertainty in European economic conditions and may also cause uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue, and may result in increased supply chain costs for items that are imported from other countries. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, unexpected increases in demand, transportation issues, labor issues, weather-related events, natural disasters or other factors beyond the control of us or our suppliers or franchisees. If we experience interruptions in our System's supply chain, or if contingency planning is not effective, our costs could increase and/or the availability of products critical to our System's operations could be limited.\n\n## Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. In particular, our franchisees have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility associated with the pandemic. If franchisee sales trends worsen or volatility persists, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.",

These initiatives aim to meet customer expectations for quick, low-cost delivery but could disrupt operations if not managed effectively, impacting profitability. Meanwhile, MCD's global franchise model faces risks from international supply chain interruptions and the complexity of aligning diverse markets with consistent brand expectations. These differences highlight HD's focus on localized delivery infrastructure versus MCD's challenge of managing global supply chains and franchisee performance across more than 100 countries.",

Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery and/or convenient pickup options. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process by improving the online customer experience as well as our delivery options. The coordinated operation of our network of physical stores, distribution facilities, and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy. We have our BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS and direct fulfillment delivery options, but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery or pickup times, options and costs.\n\nIn addition, a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment or curbside pickup could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-selling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nFailure to provide a relevant or effective online customer experience in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment; or to otherwise timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nA positive brand and reputation are critical to our business success, and, if our brand and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, associates, suppliers, vendors, and shareholders, and, consequently, our business and results of operations or the price of our stock.\n\nOur brand and reputation are critical to attracting customers, associates, suppliers and vendors to do business with us. We must continue to manage and protect our brand and reputation. Negative incidents can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our brand and reputation, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our ability to recruit, engage, motivate and retain associates, attract regulatory scrutiny, and impact our relationships with current and potential suppliers and vendors. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, economic, geopolitical, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups. Customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company, including our products and services, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. Negative sentiment about the Company shared over social media could impact our brand and reputation, whether or not it is based in fact.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to expand our supply chain and enhance the interconnected shopping experience could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.\n\nWe continue to invest in our interconnected retail strategy, including by making significant investments to expand our supply chain. These investments are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers; simplify customer interactions; provide our customers with a more interconnected shopping experience; and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. Executing our interconnected retail strategy requires continual investment in our operations and information technology systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes, systems and support. Building out our supply chain also involves significant real estate projects as we expand our distribution network, requiring us to identify and secure available locations with appropriate characteristics needed to support the different types of facilities. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, implementing new technologies, implementing and restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact our profitability.\n\nIn addition, our stores are a key element of our interconnected retail strategy, serving as the hub of our customers' interconnected shopping experience.

Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System's ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.\n\nDisruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers' operations, and asset seizures.

You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8.\n\n## Strategic Risks\n\n## Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share.\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. These competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.\n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Furthermore, customers are increasingly shopping online and seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options, including curbside pickup. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including leveraging the momentum of our strategic investments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery and pickup options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins.\n\nWe use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could adversely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior interconnected customer experience or through maintenance of effective sales and marketing, advertising or promotional programs leveraging both our digital and physical platforms, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; shifts in consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others), or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data, however, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. Customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also increasing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.\n\nCustomer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding.

This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-10 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nASU 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,' which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met.

Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonald's China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented.\n\n## ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standard Update ('ASU') No. 2019-12, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes' ('ASU 2019-12'), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes.

The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022.

The pronouncement amends the current guidance on classification for a lease that includes variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. Under the amended guidance, a lessor must classify as an operating lease any lease that would otherwise be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease and that would result in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement.

HD notes that shrink may necessitate operational changes that increase costs and impact the customer experience, which could undermine their investments in an interconnected shopping experience and store safety initiatives. Similarly, LOW states that higher shrink can require cost-increasing operational adjustments and detract from their ability to invest in localized merchandising and omnichannel capabilities.

Our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect or fully support an interconnected shopping experience. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as protect against loss or theft of our inventory (also called 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we continue to experience, can require operational changes that may increase costs and impact the customer experience.\n\nOur investments to enhance our interconnected shopping experience and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.\n\nAs part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships, maintain favorable terms with current suppliers, or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results.\n\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions.\n\nWe regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, such as our acquisition of HD Supply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We generally expect that these transactions will result in sales increases, cost savings, synergies, enhanced capabilities or various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our acquisitions, we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the target company's products, services, associates, and information technology, financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, technology and cybersecurity systems, and operations and make them more difficult to manage. Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional risks and liabilities. Strategic transactions may also be subject to significant regulatory uncertainty. The changing enforcement landscape may result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated outcome of a transaction. Any failure in the execution of a strategic transaction, our approach to the integration of an acquired asset or business, or achieving expected synergies or other benefits could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs.\n\nOur customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including increased market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics; the continuing impacts of the pandemic; and our reputation within the labor market. We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market.

In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC.\n\n## Strategic, Competitive, Operational, and Reputational Risks\n\nWe may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits, demands, and demographics of our customers, or realize the intended benefits of strategic initiatives. The home improvement retail environment, like the retail environment generally, is rapidly evolving, and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers' changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic, social, style, and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings. Customers' expectations about how they wish to research, purchase, and receive products and services have also evolved. It is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand. As customers begin to expect a more personalized experience, our ability to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group is important to our ability to effectively meet customer expectations. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.\n\nFurther, we have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. Our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (known as 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time, can require operational changes that may increase costs.\n\nFailure to identify such trends, adapt our business concept, implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment, improve and maintain safe stores, and implement change, growth, productivity and other strategic initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell, the rate of growth of our business, our market share, and results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them.\n\nOur interactions with customers have evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business. Omnichannel retail is quickly evolving, and we must anticipate and meet our customers' expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors. Our customer-facing technology systems must appeal to our customers, function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience. We also need to collect, use and share relevant customer data to effectively meet customer expectations of a more personalized experience. Our ability to collect, use, and share such data is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security, as well as the change of third party policies restricting data collection, use, and sharing.\n\nThe success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers' changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics have required us to and will continue to require us to deliver large, complex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and program sequencing. These initiatives have required and will continue to require new competencies in many positions, and our management, employees and contractors have had to and will need to continue to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. To the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, to support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals. The market for these professionals is increasingly competitive. Our results of operations, financial condition, or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers, regardless of sales channel, if our technology systems do not meet our customers' expectations, if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract, retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the Company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment.",

Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:\n\n- Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n- Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\n\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.\n\nThe Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.\n\nRefer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\n\nAdjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Total shareholders' equity.\n\nThe Company's global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net, within the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (a component of Total shareholders' equity), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nRefer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 66",

      "question": "How do the intercompany loan structures at GM and NKE differently impact their consolidated financial risk exposure, particularly in terms of foreign currency and interest rate risk?",
      "answer": "GM's intercompany loans primarily involve commercial loans to dealers and are denominated in U.S. Dollars, with $0.2 billion outstanding at the end of 2021. These loans are not specifically hedged in the same way as NKE\u2019s intercompany loans, which are largely denominated in non-functional currencies and are substantially hedged using forward contracts. NKE considers the interest rate and foreign exchange risks associated with these intercompany loans to be immaterial due to these hedges. Therefore, while GM\u2019s intercompany loans are more directly tied to operational financing needs without explicit foreign exchange hedging, NKE mitigates its exposure through financial instruments, resulting in a lower consolidated financial risk related to these loans.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GM's 10-K, extract that intercompany loans from GM Financial were $0.2 billion at the end of 2021, primarily consisting of commercial loans to dealers.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize that GM's intercompany loans are operational in nature and not explicitly hedged, while NKE actively hedges its intercompany loans, reducing consolidated financial risk.",
        "Step 4: Conclude that the impact on consolidated financial risk differs: GM has more direct exposure, while NKE neutralizes risk through hedging."

Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed  securities.  Our  investment  guidelines,  which  we  may  change  from  time  to  time,  prescribe  certain  minimum  credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the total size of our credit facilities was $18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021, we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April 18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021, we terminated our three-year, $2.0 billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.\n\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.\n\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.4 billion on its common stock in  2021,  2020,  and  2019.  Current  dividend  levels  are  reflective  of  GM  Financial  earnings  supported  by  strong  residual  values, favorable  credit  performance  and  improved  economic  conditions.  Future  dividends  from  GM  Financial  will  depend  on  several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.",

      "answer": "Tesla's obligations to compensate fund investors for losses related to reductions in investment tax credits and its status as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) introduce contingent liabilities tied to the performance and regulatory treatment of solar energy systems. These obligations are specific to Tesla's renewable energy financing model and require forecasting based on projected tax credit availability and system performance. McDonald's, on the other hand, faces contingent liabilities from potential unfavorable rulings in lawsuits covering franchising, supplier, employee, and customer disputes. These liabilities are inherent to its extensive restaurant network and franchising model, requiring forecasting based on litigation trends and settlement probabilities. While Tesla's financial forecasting must account for regulatory changes affecting tax credits and the financial performance of VIEs, McDonald's forecasting focuses on legal risks arising from its operational scale and stakeholder interactions.

          "chunk_text": "## Our business is subject to an increasing focus on ESG matters.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing focus by stakeholders - including employees, franchisees, customers, suppliers, governmental and non-governmental organizations and investors - on ESG matters. A failure, whether real or perceived, to address ESG matters or to achieve progress on our ESG initiatives could adversely affect our business, including by heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as those related to consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand, labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, and legal and regulatory complexity. Conversely, our taking a position, whether real or perceived, on ESG, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe standards we set for ourselves regarding ESG matters, and our ability to meet such standards, may also impact our business. For example, we are working to manage risks and costs to our System related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources, and we have announced initiatives relating to, among other things, environmental sustainability, responsible sourcing and increasing diverse representation across our System. We may face increased scrutiny related to reporting on and achieving these initiatives, as well as continued public focus on similar matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. We may also face increased pressure from stakeholders to provide expanded disclosure and establish additional commitments, targets or goals, and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to additional market, operational, execution and reputational costs and risks. Moreover, addressing ESG matters requires Systemwide coordination and alignment, and the standards by which certain ESG matters are measured are evolving and subject to assumptions that could change over time.\n\n## Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects.\n\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, climate change or terrorist activities (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer behavior and confidence levels, supply availability and costs and local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of such weather-related events and natural disasters. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.\n\n## LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of such claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed under 'Government Regulations' below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits, laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on the Company's net income for the period in which it occurs and/or future periods.\n\n## \u25aa Franchising\n\nA substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators and developmental licensees under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects, including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding franchise grants or terminations, alleged discrimination, delinquent payments of rents and fees and claims for additional franchises or franchise renewals. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes.\n\n## \u25aa Suppliers\n\nThe Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Company's high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its current or former suppliers relating to, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Company's business relationship with suppliers. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Company's restaurants.\n\n## \u25aa Employees\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes occasionally arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including, but not limited to, wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with labor and employment laws.\n\n## \u25aa Customers\n\nMcDonald's restaurants - whether owned by subsidiaries of the Company, independent owner/operators or developmental licensees - regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes occasionally arise as to products, service, incidents, pricing, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.",

          "chunk_text": "For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk's prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. More recently, on November 16, 2021, the SEC issued a subpoena to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended.\n\nOn December 4, 2019, the SEC issued a subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and contracts including Tesla's regular financing arrangements. On December 16, 2021, the SEC informed us that it closed this investigation. Separately, the DOJ had also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about the above matter related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates. We have not received any further requests from DOJ on these matters since we last provided information in May 2019. There have not been any additional developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position.\n\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.\n\n## Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns\n\nWe are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in investment tax credits claimed under U.S. federal laws for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a co-sited solar power facility. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known at the filing date.\n\nWe are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one state's incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received.\n\n## Letters of Credit\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $286 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\n\n## Note 16 - Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\n\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities ('VIEs') and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810, Consolidation . We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\n\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\n\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor's interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements.\n\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.",

      "answer": "McDonald's use of third-party delivery services may reduce profitability compared to non-delivery transactions, as stated in their filing, due to lower margins and additional risks related to food quality, safety, and customer satisfaction. In contrast, Tesla's self-operated service model allows faster problem identification and resolution, better logistics optimization, and remote diagnostics, which likely reduce service-related costs and maintain higher customer satisfaction. Since McDonald's explicitly notes that third-party delivery may introduce risks that could reduce profitability and Tesla emphasizes cost and efficiency benefits from direct service control, their service models have opposite implications for operational efficiency and margin stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From McDonald's 10-K, we learn that third-party delivery may 'not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction' and may introduce 'additional food quality, food safety and customer satisfaction risks.'",

If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors predict or respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer behavior and preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies and marketing plans, as well as the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy. However, they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, which could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.\n\nAdditionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively, efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them. If our advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.\n\n## Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization, digital engagement and delivery in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which may not generate expected results. We also continue to offer and refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction, and may introduce additional food quality, food safety and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer experience initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.\n\n## We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.\n\nWe compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores, coffee shops and online retailers. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions, product offerings or consolidation of our competitors and third-party partners, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.\n\nWe compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in technology and modernization, and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business.\n\n## We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald's brand and our business.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to do so in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.\n\nWe cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.",

Our current production continues to be affected by the industry-wide semiconductor and other component shortages, requiring additional workaround manufacturing and production design solutions to be implemented which may be difficult to sustain. Builds of Model Y in Gigafactory Texas and equipment testing through the vehicle production process in Gigafactory Berlin started in late 2021. The next phase of production growth will depend on the testing and ramp at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Consistent with our approach of innovating manufacturing techniques at our new factories, we expect as well to pioneer new methods related to the mass production of these cells and our unique structural battery pack concept. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability.\n\nHowever, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints which may increase the number of manufacturing and production design workaround solutions required, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\n\n## Automotive-Demand and Sales\n\nOur cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles' affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. In addition to ramping production in 2022, we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles' performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from a spike in demand in the automotive industry generally, as well as ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness.\n\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade, environmental and political uncertainty, all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to continue to execute well to maintain our momentum.\n\n## Automotive-Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure\n\nAs our deliveries increase, we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries. Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory Shanghai has been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThe Company is in the process of implementing a comprehensive, multi-year finance and technology transformation initiative to migrate its general ledger, financial close and consolidation processes onto new financial systems. The Company is performing the implementation in the ordinary course of business to increase efficiency and to modernize the tools and technology used in its key financial processes. This is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. As the phased implementation of the systems continues, the Company may have changes to its processes and procedures that are expected to enhance the Company's internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, the Company will continue to monitor and modify, as needed, the design and operating effectiveness of key control activities to align with the new business processes and capabilities of the new financial systems.\n\nExcept for these changes, the Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, confirm there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S REPORT\n\nManagement's Report and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting are set forth in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters\n\nThe following table summarizes information about the Company's equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2021.

A major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings.\n\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\n\nFor example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr. Musk's statement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we, among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors, appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters. On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previously-agreed disclosure procedures, which was subsequently approved by the Court. All other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification. Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us.\n\n## We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\n\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\n\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\n## The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $1,243.49 per share and a low of $539.49 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.",

      "answer": "McDonald's elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio, noting that the impact of occupancy costs like site maintenance was immaterial and generally limited to company-owned locations. Tesla, on the other hand, elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for most agreements, except for direct sales-type leases and production equipment embedded in supply agreements.

          "chunk_text": "## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand and third party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business.\n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term (with the exception of rent concessions as a result of COVID-19 - refer to the Leasing section that follows) and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Dynamic Yield third party revenues are generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and are recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service is performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees, primarily in the U.S. Since McDonald's manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of McDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finalized and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for COVID-19 related rent concessions as if they were part of the enforceable rights and obligations of the parties under the existing lease contract. This was elected for the Company's entire lessee and lessor portfolio for any rent deferrals or rent abatements. For the lessee portfolio, the Company elected not to remeasure the Lease right- of-use asset and Lease liability if a rent deferral or a rent abatement was granted. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability.\n\nThe Company deferred collection of approximately $490 million of rental income on revenue that was recognized in 2020, and has collected substantially all of these deferrals as of December 31, 2021. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales.\n\nRefer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information on deferred collections of rental income as well as royalties.",

We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.\n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\n\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\n\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\n\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases commencing after January 1, 2019. For historical leases, we used the index or rate as of January 1, 2019. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term in interest expense.\n\nThe balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheets:\n\n",

      "answer": "GM implemented a cost reduction program targeting a $2.0 billion annual run rate reduction by the end of 2024, factoring in inflationary cost increases and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. This approach reflects a direct response to supply chain and logistics challenges mentioned in its 2023 10-K. Meanwhile, McDonald's managed supply chain cost pressures through rapid inventory turnover, menu price adjustments, and leveraging its substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs, as noted in its 2023 filing. While GM focused on reducing fixed costs across its automotive operations, McDonald's leveraged its real estate assets and pricing flexibility to mitigate inflationary pressures, highlighting two distinct strategies tailored to their respective industries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from GM's 10-K - GM announced a $2.0 billion annual fixed cost reduction program by the end of 2024 to address supply chain and logistics challenges.",
        "Step 2: Extract from McDonald's 10-K - McDonald's managed supply chain cost pressures through rapid inventory turnover, menu price adjustments, and substantial property holdings at fixed costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies addressed supply chain challenges but employed different strategies: GM focused on reducing fixed costs in automotive operations, while McDonald's leveraged pricing flexibility and real estate assets to manage inflationary pressures."

      "question": "How do work stoppages pose distinct operational risks to General Motors' manufacturing processes and McDonald's labor-dependent business model, based on their respective 2023 10-K disclosures?",
      "answer": "General Motors faces risks from work stoppages that could disrupt production schedules at its manufacturing facilities, especially given that substantially all of its hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Such disruptions could lead to harm to GM's reputation, increased costs, lower revenues, and loss of customers. McDonald's, on the other hand, faces risks from work stoppages related to labor recruitment, retention, and compliance with increasingly complex labor regulations. These challenges could negatively impact restaurant staffing, customer service, and satisfaction, as well as expose the company to potential liability and increased operational costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GM's 10-K, we learn that work stoppages are a risk due to unionized labor and collective bargaining agreements, which could disrupt production and lead to financial and reputational harm.",
        "Step 2: From McDonald's 10-K, we see that work stoppages affect their labor-dependent business model by impacting staffing levels, increasing costs, and potentially damaging customer satisfaction.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both sources, work stoppages represent a shared risk factor but manifest differently\u2014GM faces manufacturing disruption risks, while McDonald's faces labor and operational challenges."

      "question": "Considering Amazon's $18.5 billion 2021 Notes issuance and Tesla's full settlement of their 2021 Notes, what does this contrast in debt management approaches suggest about their respective capital structure strategies in 2021?",
      "answer": "Amazon issued $18.5 billion in 2021 Notes with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2061 and stated interest rates between 0.25% and 3.25%, indicating a strategy to raise long-term capital at favorable rates. In contrast, Tesla fully settled its 2021 Notes, along with its subsidiary's 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 and the 2025 Notes, suggesting a strategy to reduce debt obligations and potentially reallocate capital elsewhere. This contrast highlights Amazon's focus on long-term financing and Tesla's emphasis on debt reduction in their capital structure management during 2021.",

The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2021 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 5.3 million shares of our common stock during the same period. Additionally, during the second and third quarters of 2021, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 15.8 million shares of our common stock.\n\n## 2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn March 2017, we issued $978 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $966 million.\n\nEach $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is convertible into 15.2670 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $65.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. As of December 31, 2021, holders of the 2022 Notes have the option to convert. Such holders also had the option to convert in each quarter in 2021 due to the closing price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the prior applicable quarter. We have elected to settle the principal in cash and the conversion premium in net shares upon a conversion. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances.\n\nIn accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We recorded to stockholders' equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount was being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%, which is no longer applicable under ASU 2020-06.\n\nIn connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $65.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $131.00 per share. We received $53 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $65.50 to $131.00 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders' equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, $474 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was early converted and settled in cash for the par amount and 6.5 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 6.5 million shares of our common stock during the same period. The related warrants will settle under their terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $439 million.\n\n## 2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.",

      "answer": "Amazon's 2022 10-K filing reveals that its equity investment in Rivian is valued at $15.6 billion, reflecting a financial strategy of directly investing in an electric vehicle (EV) company to support its stake in the growing EV logistics market. In contrast, Tesla's 2022 10-K emphasizes its reliance on equity-based compensation as a core component of its talent acquisition and retention strategy, aligning employee incentives with long-term shareholder interests. This highlights a divergent capital allocation approach: Amazon allocates capital externally through a major equity stake in a strategic partner, while Tesla focuses internally by using equity to motivate and retain key personnel in a competitive EV market.",

Moreover, we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reasons. Likewise, as a result of our temporary suspension of various U.S. manufacturing operations in the first half of 2020, in April 2020, we temporarily furloughed certain hourly employees and reduced most salaried employees' base salaries. We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.\n\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.\n\n## We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.\n\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.\n\nOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\n\nWe continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\n\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\n\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers' systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers' systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers' security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\n\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\n\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results.

This initiative introduces financial risks such as delays or errors in implementation, security failures like loss or corruption of data, reputational harm, increased costs, and other significant disruptions. On the other hand, McDonald's is implementing a comprehensive, multi-year technology and operating model transformation across multiple areas of the business, focusing on modernizing tools and technology used in key financial processes. McDonald's specifically notes that this transformation is not in response to any identified deficiency in internal control over financial reporting, and they have modified processes to enhance internal controls during the system implementation.

      "answer": "A $5 million data breach at a shared marketing partner could have significant financial implications for both Booking Holdings and Starbucks. For Booking Holdings, the breach could trigger litigation risks and notification requirements, as their 10-K explicitly states that third-party breaches may be perceived as their own, damaging their reputation and exposing them to regulatory penalties. This could necessitate an increase in litigation reserves to cover potential settlements or fines. For Starbucks, the breach could erode consumer trust, as their 10-K highlights that incidents involving business partners can lead to negative publicity, boycotts, or litigation, which could also necessitate additional reserves and damage brand equity. Both companies would likely face parallel financial risks due to the shared vulnerability through their marketing partners.",

      "question": "What specific U.S. state income tax liabilities have Booking Holdings and Starbucks disclosed in their 2023 10-K filings related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the Tax Act, and how do their respective disclosures differ in terms of financial exposure?",
      "answer": "Booking Holdings disclosed that repatriation of foreign earnings will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, and the company has accrued for these liabilities. Specifically, Booking Holdings had U.S. state NOLs of $259 million at the end of 2023, which could reduce future state tax liabilities. In contrast, Starbucks did not disclose a specific dollar amount for potential U.S. state income tax liabilities related to repatriation, but it noted that if foreign earnings were repatriated, the company could be subject to material additional U.S. state income taxes. The key difference is that Booking Holdings has quantified its state NOLs and accrued for potential liabilities, while Starbucks has not provided a specific financial exposure figure, only a qualitative warning of potential material impact.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BKNG_10k_2023.pdf, Booking Holdings states that repatriation of foreign earnings will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and that the company has accrued for these liabilities. It also reports U.S. state NOLs of $259 million at December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: From SBUX_10k_2023.pdf, Starbucks acknowledges that repatriation of foreign earnings could result in additional U.S. state income taxes, but does not disclose a specific dollar amount for these potential liabilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences: Booking Holdings provides a concrete figure for its U.S. state NOLs and indicates it has accrued for repatriation-related state tax liabilities, while Starbucks only provides a qualitative warning of potential material state tax exposure without quantifying it."

      "question": "BKNG emphasizes domain names as part of its intellectual property portfolio with associated risks, while SBUX treats domain names like 'Starbucks.com' as stable digital brand assets without specific risk disclosures. Given BKNG's exposure to regulatory and cybersecurity risks tied to domain name usage, and SBUX's focus on domain names as brand extensions, how does the difference in their domain name strategies reflect on their respective approaches to digital asset risk management and brand protection?",
      "answer": "BKNG explicitly treats domain names as part of its broader intellectual property portfolio that is subject to cybersecurity, regulatory, and enforcement risks, indicating a risk-sensitive approach to digital asset management. In contrast, SBUX lists domain names like 'Starbucks.com' and 'Starbucksreserve.com' as maintained assets without associating them with specific risks, suggesting a more stable and brand-focused treatment. This divergence reflects BKNG's emphasis on domain names as critical and vulnerable digital infrastructure in its online travel platform, versus SBUX's view of domain names primarily as brand extensions supporting its retail and digital engagement strategies. BKNG's approach implies higher investment in domain-related security and compliance, while SBUX's implies lower operational risk or cost allocation in this area.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BKNG includes domain names as part of its intellectual property portfolio and links them to cybersecurity and regulatory risks.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SBUX lists specific domain names ('Starbucks.com', 'Starbucksreserve.com') as maintained assets but does not associate them with any risk factors.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Contrast BKNG\u2019s risk-sensitive treatment of domain names (linked to regulatory and cybersecurity concerns) with SBUX\u2019s stable, brand-focused view (no risk disclosure), revealing differing digital asset risk management strategies."

Similarly, LOW states that supply chain disruptions, including those from the COVID-19 pandemic, have negatively affected the flow and availability of their products.

      "answer": "The Home Depot allocated $3.2 billion in capital expenditures to support its business and advance goals such as building an interconnected customer experience, while also planning to reduce fixed costs by approximately $500 million to increase competitiveness through cost efficiency. In contrast, Lowe\u2019s focused on transforming its supply chain network by investing in facilities such as regional distribution centers, flatbed distribution centers, and fulfillment centers to support its omnichannel strategy and improve delivery speed and efficiency. These strategies reflect different approaches to competitiveness: The Home Depot emphasized reinvestment in customer experience and cost reduction, whereas Lowe\u2019s prioritized supply chain modernization and fulfillment capabilities.",

      "answer": "Home Depot's 2023 filing shows that Millwork is a distinct component of its Building Materials merchandising department, which also includes Electrical/Lighting, Lumber, and Plumbing. This integration suggests Millwork is strategically aligned with core construction materials. Lowe's 2023 filing further reinforces the importance of Millwork by explicitly listing it among its key product categories, alongside major lines like Appliances and Tools, and emphasizing its inclusion in both in-store and online assortments. Additionally, Lowe's commitment to offering national brands and expanding product availability\u2014such as the reintroduction of Klein Tools\u2014implies a strategic effort to strengthen its Millwork and related offerings to meet customer demand.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies explicitly include Millwork in their core product lines, indicating its strategic importance within the Building Materials segment. Lowe's broader omnichannel and brand expansion efforts further highlight a focused approach to Millwork."

      "answer": "Home Depot (HD) includes Flooring as one of the key components within its D\u00e9cor merchandising department, which also includes Appliances, D\u00e9cor/Storage, Kitchen and Bath, and Paint. This indicates that Flooring is a strategically positioned product category within HD's broader D\u00e9cor offering. In contrast, Lowe's (LOW) does not provide the exact percentage of flooring sales within its installed sales model, but it does note that Flooring is one of the major categories contributing to installed sales, which include both product and labor and accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2023. This suggests that while HD integrates flooring as a core product within its D\u00e9cor department, LOW emphasizes flooring through its installation services, bundling it with labor to create a more comprehensive customer offering.",

      "question": "How does McDonald's reliance on third-party delivery services for enhancing its service model compare with Tesla's direct control over its vehicle service operations, and what are the potential risks each company faces in these respective service strategies?",
      "answer": "McDonald's utilizes third-party delivery services to enhance its service model and digital engagement, which may introduce additional food quality, food safety, and customer satisfaction risks, and may not have the same level of profitability as non-delivery transactions. In contrast, Tesla provides vehicle service directly through company-owned service locations and Tesla Mobile Service technicians, allowing faster problem identification and resolution compared to traditional manufacturers. However, Tesla faces risks related to scalability and geographic coverage of its service network. McDonald's risks center around quality control and profitability when relying on third parties, while Tesla's risks involve maintaining service speed and coverage as its vehicle fleet grows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From MCD_10k_2023.pdf, extract that McDonald's uses third-party delivery services which may introduce food quality, safety, and customer satisfaction risks and may not be as profitable as non-delivery transactions.",
        "Step 2: From TSLA_10k_2023.pdf, extract that Tesla provides service directly through company-owned locations and mobile technicians, allowing faster problem identification and resolution.",
        "Step 3: Compare the service models: McDonald's relies on external partners (third-party delivery), while Tesla maintains direct control over its automotive service.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the potential risks: McDonald's faces risks related to quality and profitability due to third-party involvement, whereas Tesla faces scalability and geographic coverage challenges due to its direct service model."

In contrast, Tesla highlights the inherent limitations of internal controls, specifically noting that misstatements may not always be prevented or detected, which implies a higher risk of undetected unauthorized transactions. This difference suggests that McDonald's may have a more robust framework for addressing unauthorized transactions, while Tesla's disclosures indicate a greater acknowledged vulnerability to such risks.",

      "answer": "Lowe's approach to being an employer of choice is evidenced by its recognition through multiple awards in fiscal 2024, including the Disability:IN National Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion and Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies Specialty Retailer. These awards indicate that Lowe's has successfully implemented workforce strategies centered around diversity, inclusion, and associate engagement, which can lead to measurable outcomes such as improved employee retention, higher productivity, and enhanced brand reputation. These outcomes can positively impact Lowe's financial performance by reducing recruitment and training costs and improving customer service and sales efficiency. Tesla, on the other hand, emphasizes offering best-in-industry benefits as part of its workforce strategy to become an employer of choice. This approach is aligned with its broader mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy and supports its competitive positioning in a rapidly-evolving industry. Tesla's focus on impactful jobs and best-in-industry benefits likely contributes to attracting and retaining top talent, which is critical for maintaining its technological edge and scaling production efficiently. These workforce strategies can lead to measurable outcomes such as reduced turnover costs, increased innovation, and higher operational efficiency, all of which have direct financial implications for Tesla.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Our Services\n\n## Installed Sales\n\nWe offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Kitchen &amp; Bath, Flooring, Appliances, Millwork, and Rough Plumbing accounting for the majority of installed sales.  Our installed sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently ex ecuted.  We are simplifying the process through a team of remote associates that we call our central selling team. This team handles building quotes, answering questions over video or phone call, and providing personalized support to our customers. We are also implementing technology that allows our customers to finalize their installation contract and checkout on lowes.com or mobile application, so they do not need to return to the store. Installed sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2024.\n\n## Lowe's Protection Plans and Repair Services\n\nWe offer extended protection plans for certain products within the Appliances, Kitchens &amp; Bath, D\u00e9cor, Millwork, Rough Plumbing, Electrical, Seasonal &amp; Outdoor Living, Tools, and Hardware categories. These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances the coverage offered by the manufacturer's warranty and provide additional benefits and repair services that extend beyond the manufacturer's warranty.\n\n## Seasonality and Working Capital\n\nThe home improvement business in general is subject to seasonal influences, particularly related to the spring selling season.  Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June, and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December, and January).  Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes.  We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed.  For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations', of this Annual Report.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe name 'Lowe's' is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and logo and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary owns and maintains various additional registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks and trade names, including private brand product names, such as, 'Kobalt', 'STAINMASTER', and 'allen+roth.' This subsidiary also maintains various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nWhen it comes to attracting and retaining top talent, Lowe's strives to be the employer of choice in retail. At Lowe's we are committed to creating valuable career opportunities for our associates, supporting them and the communities where they live, and cultivating a culture that invites and encourages diverse opinions and ideas. We would like our associates to see Lowe's as a 'Home to Possibility' with good jobs, a sense of belonging, and a promising future.\n\nAs a testament to our commitments, in fiscal 2024 we received several notable employer of choice awards, including being named on the Disability:IN National Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies Specialty Retailer, 2024 Great Place to Work Certified - U.S. and India, Fair360 Top 50 Noteworthy Company for Workplace Fairness, 2024 American Opportunity Index Top 100 Company, and a Best Corporation for Veteran's Business Enterprises of the Year.",

We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\n\n## Solar Energy Systems\n\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (E SG) and Human Capital Resources\n\n## ESG\n\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\n\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our incidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling, impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.",

      "question": "How do Lowe's expansion of installation services and Tesla's deployment of energy storage products reflect differing strategic approaches to customer value creation in the home improvement and sustainable energy sectors?",
      "answer": "Lowe's focuses on expanding installation services as part of its Total Home strategy, aiming to simplify home improvement for customers through high-value, service-oriented solutions provided by independent installers or third-party models. This approach enhances customer experience and supports both DIY and DIFM (do-it-for-me) project completions. Tesla, on the other hand, emphasizes deploying energy storage products (31.4 GWh in 2024) as part of its broader mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. Tesla's installation services are tied to its energy products, such as solar and storage systems, which support its vision of an integrated energy ecosystem. While both companies provide installation services, Lowe's strategy centers on enhancing retail and service offerings for home improvement, whereas Tesla's approach is aligned with its product-centric sustainable energy mission.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\n\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products. In addition, as we continue to develop our artificial intelligence services and products, we may face many additional challenges, including the availability and cost of energy, processing power limitations and the substantial power requirements for our data centers.\n\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.\n\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control could also affect these suppliers' ability to deliver technologies or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\n## We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\n\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories. The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject",

      "question": "How does the adoption of ASU 2023-08 create different financial reporting impacts for LOW and TSLA, particularly in terms of disclosure requirements and asset measurement practices?",
      "answer": "The adoption of ASU 2023-08 affects LOW and TSLA differently based on their business activities and asset composition. For LOW, the ASU primarily expands segment disclosure requirements, mandating the inclusion of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. This will increase LOW's disclosure burden in its 10-K filings starting in fiscal year 2025. In contrast, for TSLA, the ASU significantly changes the measurement and reporting of crypto assets, requiring them to be measured at fair value on the balance sheet and income statement each reporting period. This will introduce increased volatility into TSLA's financial statements due to market fluctuations in crypto asset values. Additionally, TSLA must provide enhanced disclosures including the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto holding, which is particularly relevant given TSLA's known crypto asset holdings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From LOW's 10-K, extract information about ASU 2023-08 expanding segment disclosure requirements, specifically mentioning significant segment expenses and interim disclosures of segment profit or loss (fiscal year 2025 effective date).",
        "Step 2: From TSLA's 10-K, extract information about ASU 2023-08 requiring crypto assets to be measured at fair value on the balance sheet and income statement, with enhanced disclosures about crypto holdings.",
        "Step 3: Compare the nature of the impacts - LOW faces increased disclosure requirements for segment reporting while TSLA faces changes in asset measurement practices with potential volatility from fair value accounting for crypto assets.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize how these different impacts relate to each company's specific business characteristics - LOW's retail operations versus TSLA's crypto asset holdings."

      "answer": "Lowe's operates 17 retail stores in Nevada, as indicated in their 2023 10-K filing, reflecting a tangible business footprint in the state. In contrast, Tesla specifically highlights Nevada as a location of operational risk due to its seismic activity, as Gigafactory Nevada is located in a seismically active region. Tesla's 2023 10-K filing notes that natural disasters such as earthquakes could seriously damage their facilities or disrupt production, posing a material adverse impact on their business. While Lowe's presence in Nevada is represented by a numerical store count indicating retail exposure, Tesla's risk is tied to geographic vulnerabilities affecting critical manufacturing operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Lowe's operates 17 stores in Nevada, as stated in the state-by-state table in their 2023 10-K filing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Tesla identifies Nevada as a location with seismic risk that could materially impact operations at Gigafactory Nevada.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The comparison highlights different types of exposure: Lowe's has a measurable retail footprint in Nevada, while Tesla faces geographic risk at a key production facility."

      "answer": "LOW operates 17 retail stores in Nevada, reflecting its consumer-facing retail strategy focused on geographic market coverage and local customer access. In contrast, TSLA relies on Nevada for its manufacturing capabilities, specifically mentioning the state as a key location for its production ramp and supply chain operations. This suggests that LOW prioritizes physical retail presence to support customer engagement, while TSLA emphasizes industrial infrastructure to scale production and meet its vehicle output targets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - LOW operates 17 stores in Nevada, indicating a retail footprint in the state.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - TSLA identifies Nevada as a critical manufacturing site, essential for production ramp and operational scalability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast highlights different strategic uses of Nevada: LOW leverages it for retail accessibility, while TSLA depends on it for industrial production, reflecting their respective business models and operational priorities."

The indentures governing the notes do not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that the Company may issue and do not require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios or levels of net worth or liquidity. However, the indentures include various restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact the Company's liquidity or capital resources.\n\nThe discounts associated with these issuances, which include the underwriting and issuance discounts, are recorded in long-term debt and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed cash tender offers to purchase and retire $3.0 billion combined aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.80%.

The indentures also contain a provision that allows the holders of the notes to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their notes if a change of control triggering event occurs. If elected under the change of control provisions, the repurchase of the notes will occur at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, on such notes up to the date of purchase. The indentures governing the notes do not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that the Company may issue and do not require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios or levels of net worth or liquidity. However, the indentures include various restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact the Company's liquidity or capital resources.\n\nThe discounts associated with these issuances, which include the underwriting and issuance discounts, are recorded in long-term debt and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed cash tender offers to purchase and retire $3.0 billion combined aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.80%. As a result of the 2020 cash tender offers, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 billion which includes premium paid to holders of the debt, unamortized deferred financing fees and original issue discounts, and loss on reverse treasury lock derivative contracts. See Note 9 for additional information regarding the reverse treasury lock derivative contracts.\n\n## NOTE 9: Derivative Instruments\n\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\nThe notional amounts of the Company's material derivative instruments are as follows:\n\n",

In contrast, Tesla settled the remaining $422 million of its 2021 Notes in early 2021, issuing 5.3 million shares of common stock for the conversion premium.

The indentures also contain a provision that allows the holders of the notes to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their notes if a change of control triggering event occurs. If elected under the change of control provisions, the repurchase of the notes will occur at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, on such notes up to the date of purchase. The indentures governing the notes do not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that the Company may issue and do not require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios or levels of net worth or liquidity. However, the indentures include various restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact the Company's liquidity or capital resources.\n\nThe discounts associated with these issuances, which include the underwriting and issuance discounts, are recorded in long-term debt and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed cash tender offers to purchase and retire $3.0 billion combined aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.80%. As a result of the 2020 cash tender offers, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 billion which includes premium paid to holders of the debt, unamortized deferred financing fees and original issue discounts, and loss on reverse treasury lock derivative contracts.

          "chunk_text": "## 2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the remaining $422 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes was settled in cash for the par amount and 5.3 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2021 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 5.3 million shares of our common stock during the same period. Additionally, during the second and third quarters of 2021, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 15.8 million shares of our common stock.\n\n## 2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn March 2017, we issued $978 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $966 million.\n\nEach $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is convertible into 15.2670 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $65.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. As of December 31, 2021, holders of the 2022 Notes have the option to convert. Such holders also had the option to convert in each quarter in 2021 due to the closing price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the prior applicable quarter. We have elected to settle the principal in cash and the conversion premium in net shares upon a conversion. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances.\n\nIn accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We recorded to stockholders' equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount was being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%, which is no longer applicable under ASU 2020-06.\n\nIn connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $65.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $131.00 per share. We received $53 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $65.50 to $131.00 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders' equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, $474 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was early converted and settled in cash for the par amount and 6.5 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 6.5 million shares of our common stock during the same period. The related warrants will settle under their terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $439 million.\n\n## 2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.",

In contrast, Goldman Sachs Bank USA acted as a syndication agent in Tesla's ABLCredit agreement amendment dated March 6, 2019, where it shared syndication responsibilities with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. and Bank of America, N.A.

      "question": "How do the data security rule compliance costs and risks described by Amazon and Lowe\u2019s differently impact their respective payment processing operations and financial liabilities?",
      "answer": "Amazon faces potential liability for card issuing banks' costs, fines, and higher transaction fees due to noncompliance with data security rules and any breach in their systems. Additionally, Amazon may incur significant costs from implementing enhanced authentication processes and risks losing the ability to accept credit and debit card payments if compliance becomes unmanageable. Lowe\u2019s, on the other hand, faces increased costs from adapting to evolving data privacy and cybersecurity laws, potential fines, regulatory sanctions, and lawsuits due to material failure to comply with regulations. They also risk financial losses from remedial actions and liability due to unauthorized data disclosure or breaches, which could be exacerbated by the use of third-party service providers. Both companies face financial and operational risks, but Amazon's exposure centers around payment system compliance and third-party dependencies, while Lowe\u2019s faces broader cybersecurity and regulatory compliance costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMZN evidence - Amazon could be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and may lose the ability to accept credit and debit card payments if they fail to comply with data security rules.",
        "Step 2: Extract from LOW evidence - Lowe\u2019s may incur increased costs adapting to evolving cybersecurity laws, face regulatory fines, lawsuits, and financial losses from data breaches or unauthorized disclosures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to data security rules, but their exposure differs: Amazon focuses on payment processing compliance and third-party service risks, while Lowe\u2019s emphasizes cybersecurity threats, regulatory compliance, and third-party vendor vulnerabilities."

      "question": "How do the approaches to Electronic Funds Transfer Rules compliance in Amazon and Lowe's 2023 filings suggest different risk management strategies that could affect their respective bottom lines?",
      "answer": "Amazon highlights that it may become subject to additional compliance requirements related to electronic funds transfers, including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of its payment products. These potential costs directly impact Amazon\u2019s operating expenses and profitability. Additionally, Amazon notes that failure to comply with payment card association rules, including those governing electronic funds transfers, could result in liability for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, fines, and higher transaction fees, as well as the loss of its ability to accept certain payment methods. This indicates a risk to revenue and increased compliance expenditures. In contrast, Lowe\u2019s focuses on the fraud and cybersecurity risks associated with payment methods subject to Electronic Funds Transfer Rules. It emphasizes potential liabilities from data breaches, fraud, and regulatory noncompliance, which could lead to financial losses, litigation, and reputational damage. Lowe\u2019s also notes the increasing costs of maintaining compliance with evolving data security rules. While Amazon emphasizes cost and operational disruption from compliance changes, Lowe\u2019s highlights fraud, cybersecurity, and litigation risks. These differing strategies suggest that Amazon\u2019s bottom line may be more affected by compliance-related cost increases, while Lowe\u2019s could face greater financial exposure from breaches and legal penalties.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon explicitly mentions the potential for significant costs due to compliance obligations related to electronic funds transfers and enhanced authentication processes, which could affect profitability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Lowe\u2019s emphasizes the financial risks from fraud, cybersecurity breaches, and litigation tied to payment systems governed by electronic funds transfer rules.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amazon\u2019s risk centers on compliance costs and operational disruption, while Lowe\u2019s risk centers on fraud and data breaches, indicating different financial exposures and risk management strategies."

      "question": "How do the certification requirements under payment card association rules specifically impact Amazon's and Lowe's compliance costs and third-party payment processor dependencies, given their respective descriptions of payment system risks?",
      "answer": "Amazon faces potential increases in compliance costs due to certification requirements under payment card association rules, which could result in significant expenses and reduce the ease of use of its payment products. Additionally, Amazon relies on third parties for certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including credit cards, debit cards, and electronic checks, which could disrupt its business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services. Lowe's, on the other hand, is subject to compliance with certification requirements, data security rules, and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards as part of its payment options. These requirements expose Lowe's to potential fraud and liability, particularly if its data security systems are breached or compromised. Both companies face financial and operational risks from these certification requirements, but Amazon emphasizes cost and ease-of-use implications, while Lowe's highlights liability and fraud risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon mentions that it is subject to certification requirements under payment card association rules, which could result in significant compliance costs and reduce the ease of use of its payment products. It also relies on third-party providers for payment processing services, which could disrupt its business.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Lowe's states that it must comply with payment card association certification requirements, data security rules, and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. Failure to comply could result in liability, fines, and fraud risks.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Amazon and Lowe's face compliance costs and business disruption risks due to certification requirements, but they emphasize different aspects: Amazon focuses on cost and ease-of-use impacts, while Lowe's highlights liability and fraud risks. The question requires understanding both companies' specific exposures to fully assess the impact of these certification requirements."

      "answer": "Security issues pose a significant threat to both Amazon and Nike, but the consequences differ based on their business models. Amazon highlights that disruptions from security issues, such as data theft, computer intrusions, and denial of service attacks, can materially harm its business by causing service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges related to its fulfillment and data center operations. Nike, on the other hand, emphasizes that cyber-attacks, including phishing, ransomware, and unauthorized access, could disrupt its digital commerce platforms and information technology systems, leading to delays in product fulfillment, reduced operational efficiency, and reputational damage. Both companies acknowledge the need for significant investments to secure their systems, but Nike specifically notes that these issues could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations, while Amazon notes potential harm to its operating results.",

C onsum ers frequently use m obile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our com petitors, and to do com parison shopping, as well as to engage with us and our com petitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on m obile platform s. W e use social m edia and proprietary m obile applications to interact with our consum ers and as a m eans to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, secure and user-friendly digital com m erce platform s that offer a wide assortm ent of m erchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually m eet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our custom ers could place us at a com petitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm  our reputation with consum ers, have a m aterial adverse im pact on the growth of our digital com m erce business globally and have a m aterial adverse im pact on our business and results of operations. In addition, as use of our digital platform s continues to grow, we will need an increasing am ount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consum ers' needs. If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platform s to accom m odate increased consum er dem and, our business m ay be subject to interruptions, delays or failures and consum er dem and for our products and digital experiences could decline.\n\nRisks specific to our digital com m erce business also include diversion of sales from  our and our retailers' brick and m ortar stores, pricing pressure on our products, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. O ur failure to successfully respond to these risks m ight adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as dam age our reputation and brands.\n\nWe rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\n\nWe are heavily dependent on Inform ation Technology System s, across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, m anufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial inform ation for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Inform ation Technology System s are critical to m any of our operating activities and our business processes and m ay be negatively im pacted by any service interruption or shutdown. F or exam ple, our ability to effectively m anage and m aintain our inventory and to ship products to custom ers on a tim ely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Inform ation Technology System s. Over a num ber of years, we have im plem ented Inform ation Technology System s in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. O ur work to integrate, secure and enhance these system s and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and N IKE  will continue to invest in these efforts. W e cannot provide assurance, however, that the m easures we take to secure and enhance these system s will be sufficient to protect our Inform ation T echnology System s and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or inform ation loss. T he failure of these system s to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, m alware, ransom ware, denial of service attacks, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, failure to properly m aintain, protect, repair or upgrade system s, or problem s with transitioning to upgraded or replacem ent system s could cause delays in product fulfillm ent and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant tim e and capital investm ents to rem ediate the problem  which m ay not be sufficient to cover all eventualities, and m ay have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the use of em ployee-owned devices for com m unications as well as hybrid work arrangem ents, present additional operational risks to our Inform ation T echnology System s, including, but not lim ited to, increased risks of cyber-attacks. F urther, like other com panies in the retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attem pts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our system s. T o date, these attacks have not had a m aterial im pact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an im pact in the future.\n\nWe also use Inform ation Technology System s to process financial inform ation and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to com ply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirem ents.

      "answer": "Amazon highlights significant workforce-related risks, including intense competition for technical talent, potential dissatisfaction with work environment policies, and challenges in hiring and retaining qualified personnel across its stores, fulfillment centers, and data centers. These risks could harm its business and increase payroll costs. Additionally, unionization efforts could reduce operational flexibility and harm efficiency. In contrast, Nike's primary operational risk is tied to its global distribution network, where any significant failure in distribution facilities\u2014due to IT problems, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks\u2014could adversely affect its ability to meet customer expectations and achieve growth targets. While Amazon's risks center on workforce constraints and labor relations, Nike's focus is on infrastructure reliability and third-party logistics performance.",

In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.\n\nWe also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce.\n\nWe are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flex ibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.\n\n## Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\n\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For ex ample, we rely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence infrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our ability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\n\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company's sales.

Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms.

We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:\n\n- disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n- impairment of other relationships;\n- variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\n- difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.",

O ur distribution facilities have in the past and could in the future be interrupted by inform ation technology problem s, disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or governm ent actions taken to m itigate their spread. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. W e maintain business interruption insurance, but it m ay not adequately protect us from  adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\n\nWe are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs a m ultinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and m ust com ply with extensive laws and regulations in the U nited States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our em ployees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to com ply with any of these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furtherm ore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict am ong jurisdictions and com pliance in one jurisdiction m ay result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. W e are involved in various types of claim s, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and governm ent investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our em ployees and representatives, including contractual and em ploym ent relationships, product liability, antitrust, tradem ark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcom e of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgm ents, fines or penalties, or enter into settlem ents of lawsuits and claim s that could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively im pact our reputation. T he global nature of our business m eans legal and com pliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environm ental, com petition, privacy and other regulatory m atters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies have and will continue to arise from  tim e to tim e, which could adversely affect us. I n addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, m ay result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. M oreover, the regulation of certain transactions we engage in, including those involving virtual goods and cryptocurrencies, rem ains in an early stage and subject to significant uncertainty. As a result, we are required to exercise our judgm ent as to whether or how certain laws or regulations apply, or m ay in the future apply, and it is possible that legislators, regulators and courts m ay disagree with our conclusions.

U .S. presidential adm inistrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or term ination of trade agreem ents, the im position of higher tariffs on im ports into the U .S., econom ic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other governm ent regulations affecting trade between the U .S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It m ay be tim e-consum ing and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or com ply with any such changes.\n\nChanges or proposed changes in U .S. or other countries' trade policies m ay result in restrictions and econom ic disincentives on international trade.

Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as any other voluntary safety protocols.\n\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.\n\nThe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\n## Item 1B.

      "answer": "Amazon's $9.2 billion in foreign net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitations and may expire starting in 2022 if not utilized, which affects the realizability of deferred tax assets and necessitates valuation allowances. These foreign losses are further complicated by Amazon's exposure to U.S. state income taxes, which introduces additional uncertainty in tax position assessments and influences the need for tax contingency reserves. Similarly, Starbucks notes that repatriating foreign cash to the U.S. could trigger material U.S. state income tax obligations, which would affect its effective tax rate and require Starbucks to maintain or adjust its own tax contingency liabilities. Both companies must therefore manage tax contingencies with careful consideration of how foreign earnings and potential repatriation interact with state-level tax obligations, creating a shared regulatory challenge that shapes their financial reporting and tax planning strategies.",

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits.

In contrast, SBUX disclosed its use of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps in fair value hedging relationships but did not specify a fair value amount in its 10-K filing. This means LOW quantitatively disclosed the fair value of these instruments, while SBUX only provided qualitative disclosure about their use for hedging.",

      "answer": "Lowe's faces competition from warehouse clubs in the home improvement industry, which influences its omnichannel strategy to provide seamless transitions across online and in-store experiences, including flexible fulfillment options such as in-store pickup and same-day delivery. In contrast, Starbucks competes with warehouse clubs in the coffee and tea product market through its Channel Development segment, where it emphasizes product quality, brand reputation, and distribution partnerships to maintain competitiveness. The omnichannel approach of Lowe\u2019s focuses on in-store and digital integration to support home improvement projects, while Starbucks leverages supply chain reliability and brand strength to secure its position in grocery and retail channels.",

For GM, such disruptions threaten their ability to deliver new technologies, including electric vehicles, which are central to their strategic priorities. Specifically, GM highlights that disruptions to their information technology systems could delay the development and commercialization of electric vehicles, which are critical for attracting consumers and driving future growth. For Home Depot, the risk centers on their e-commerce operations, especially during the pandemic when demand for online purchases significantly increased. Home Depot acknowledges that disruptions or failures in their customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits they provide, adversely impact their sales, and negatively affect their relationship with customers. Thus, while GM faces risks tied to product innovation timelines, Home Depot faces risks related to maintaining seamless online operations and customer experience.",

As the pandemic subsides, customers may shift more of their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas, which may have an adverse impact on our sales.\n\nThe above factors and uncertainties, or others of which we are not currently aware, may result in adverse impacts to our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition to the factors above, the COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business to a number of risks, including, but not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in these Risk Factors:\n\nAssociate and Customer Safety-Related Risks . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken a number of actions across our business to help protect our associates, customers, and others in the communities we serve. These measures included, among other things, increased cleaning and sanitizing measures; physical and social distancing efforts; continuing curbside pickup from stores; and modification of certain annual merchandising events. In certain jurisdictions, we temporarily ceased sales or delayed commencement of certain in-home services deemed nonessential early in the pandemic, and we may have to do so again or in other jurisdictions. Several of these actions adversely impacted our sales, and they may continue to do so going forward. We also took other steps to support our associates, including expanding certain compensation and benefits to help alleviate some of the challenges our associates were facing as a result of COVID-19. While we have transitioned from many of these temporary pay and benefits programs, the actions that we have taken in response to the pandemic resulted in significant incremental costs, and we expect that we will continue to incur additional costs due to the pandemic going forward, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nThe health and safety of our associates and customers are of primary concern to our management team. However, due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and the consequences of our actions, we may see unexpected outcomes from our added safety measures or from rolling back safety measures as conditions evolve. For example, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if our customers or associates do not participate in social distancing, vaccination efforts, and other safety measures, or if rolling back safety measures results in additional outbreaks, the well-being of our associates and customers could be at risk. Furthermore, any failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response, could cause reputational harm to our brand and/or subject us to claims and litigation from associates, customers, suppliers, regulators or other third parties. Additionally, we have faced, and may continue to face, periodic labor shortages at our stores and facilities due to COVID-19, which can result in modifications to our operations including temporary closures and negatively impact our business, costs and results of operations.\n\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers' compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase our exposure to workers' compensation claims and increase our cost of insurance.\n\nInformation Technology-Related Risks . As a result of the pandemic and related quarantines, shut-down orders, and similar restrictions, we have experienced increased demand for online purchases of products. While we have managed this increased volume to date without interruption, there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to do so. We have also had to rapidly modify certain technology systems to support our interconnected offerings in connection with the pandemic, such as the addition of curbside pickup. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with our customer-facing technology systems, either due to increased volume, system modifications, or other factors, could impair the benefits they provide, adversely impact our sales, and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. In addition, as more business activities have shifted online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as many of our store support associates continue to work in a remote or hybrid environment, we face an increased risk due to the potential failure of internal or external information technology infrastructure as well as increased cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks.\n\nSupply Chain-Related Risks . Circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic",

This differs from HD's approach, where stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period or as restrictions lapse.

        "Step 1: From GM's disclosure, RSUs granted in Cruise stock only trigger compensation cost when the liquidity condition (change in control or IPO) is met, not over a service period.",

In the event management concludes a reported NAV does not reflect fair value or is not determined as of the financial reporting measurement date, we will consider whether and when deemed necessary to make an adjustment at the balance sheet date. In  determining  whether an adjustment to the external valuation is required, we will review material factors that could affect the valuation,  such  as  changes  in  the  composition  or  performance  of  the  underlying  investments  or  comparable  investments,  overall market  conditions,  expected  sale  prices  for  private  investments  which  are  probable  of  being  sold  in  the  short-term  and  other economic factors that may possibly have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the reported external valuation.\n\nStock Incentive Plans Our stock incentive plans include RSUs, Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs), PSUs, stock options and awards that may be settled in our stock, the stock of our subsidiaries or in cash. We measure and record compensation expense based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock on the date of grant for RSUs, RSAs and PSUs and the grant date fair value, determined utilizing a lattice model or the Black-Scholes formula, for stock options and PSUs. We record compensation cost for service-based RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and service-based stock options on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, or for retirement eligible employees over the requisite service period. RSUs granted in stock of Cruise vest upon satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition, defined as a change in control transaction or the consummation of an initial public offering. Compensation costs for RSUs granted in stock of Cruise will be recorded when the liquidity condition is met. Compensation cost for awards that do not have an established accounting grant date, but for which the service inception date has been established, or are settled in cash is based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock at the end of each reporting period. We use the graded vesting method to record  compensation  cost  for  stock  options  with  market  conditions  over  the  lesser  of  the  vesting  period  or  the  time  period  an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement.\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold  and  are  charged  to Automotive  and  other  cost  of  sales.  These  estimates  are  established  using  historical  information  on  the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. Revisions are made when necessary and are based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated costs related to recall campaigns are accrued when probable and estimable. In GMNA, we estimate the costs related to recall campaigns by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. The estimated costs associated with recall campaigns in other geographical regions are determined using the  estimated  costs  of  repairs  and  the  estimated  number  of  vehicles  to  be  repaired.  Costs  associated  with  recall  campaigns  are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nIncome Taxes The  liability  method  is  used  in  accounting  for  income  taxes.  Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recorded  for temporary  differences  between  the  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  reported  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax  assets  and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  laws  or  rates  is  recorded  in  the  results  of  operations  in  the  period  that  includes  the enactment date under the law. We record Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred.\n\nWe establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard. Deferred income tax assets are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize a rolling three years of actual and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.\n\nWe record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than  not  criteria,  we  recognize  the  largest  amount  of  tax  benefit  that  is  greater  than  50%  likely  to  be  realized  upon  ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense.",

      "answer": "GM had prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends that were explicitly removed upon entering into a renewed three-year, $4.3 billion credit facility, demonstrating how external financing agreements can directly shape dividend policy by imposing or lifting capital allocation constraints. HD, on the other hand, maintains internal dividend policy constraints through its equity compensation structure\u2014dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units accrue and are paid out only upon vesting, while dividends on unvested restricted stock are paid in cash on each dividend date. This shows how companies manage dividend-related obligations through both contractual obligations (as with GM) and equity award mechanics (as with HD), with implications for liquidity planning and shareholder returns.",

Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed  securities.  Our  investment  guidelines,  which  we  may  change  from  time  to  time,  prescribe  certain  minimum  credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the total size of our credit facilities was $18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021, we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April 18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021, we terminated our three-year, $2.0 billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.\n\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.\n\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.4 billion on its common stock in  2021,  2020,  and  2019.  Current  dividend  levels  are  reflective  of  GM  Financial  earnings  supported  by  strong  residual  values, favorable  credit  performance  and  improved  economic  conditions.

At the grant date of the award, recipients of restricted stock are granted voting rights and generally receive dividends on unvested shares, paid in the form of cash on each dividend payment date. Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019. Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.\n\nWe have also granted performance share awards under the Plans. These awards provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock at the end of the three-year performance cycle based upon our performance against target average ROIC and operating profit over that performance cycle. Additionally, the awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance share awards have no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned.\n\nThe fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\n\nRestricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after the grant date. Additionally, the majority of these awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights until the vesting of the award. Recipients receive dividend equivalents that accrue on unvested units and are paid out in the form of additional shares of stock on the vesting date. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the units vest.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of restricted stock, performance shares, and restricted stock unit activity during fiscal 2021:\n\n",

      "answer": "NKE and SBUX face significant combined financial risk under China's Data Security Law due to their global data handling operations, which include managing consumer, employee, and business data across international markets. NKE explicitly states that compliance with China's Data Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law is costly and time-consuming, with potential penalties including fines, lawsuits, and significant legal expenses. Similarly, SBUX notes that noncompliance with China's Data Security Law may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. While neither company specifies exact figures for penalties related solely to China's Data Security Law, the combined financial exposure is substantial given their global digital operations and the strict enforcement environment in China.",

        "Step 1: Extract from NKE_10k_2023.pdf - NKE handles personal and business data globally and must comply with China's Data Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law, which are costly and time-consuming, with potential penalties including fines, lawsuits, and legal expenses.",
        "Step 2: Extract from SBUX_10k_2023.pdf - SBUX explicitly states that noncompliance with China's Data Security Law may result in significant civil and criminal penalties.",

      "answer": "Both Nike and Starbucks face risks to their brand value and revenue due to their reliance on licensees. Nike states that if its licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or manage their operations poorly, it could directly reduce royalty revenues and indirectly reduce sales of Nike's other products. Additionally, misuse of Nike's brand by licensees could materially harm brand value. Similarly, Starbucks notes that its global business strategy relies heavily on licensees who are authorized to use its logos and provide branded products. If these licensees deliver diminished product quality or service due to financial constraints, labor shortages, or other factors beyond Starbucks' control, it could damage consumer trust and brand value. Since both companies depend on licensees to uphold brand standards and drive revenue, any failure by these third parties to meet expectations could simultaneously harm both revenue and brand equity across both firms.",

        "Step 1: Extract from NKE 10-K - Licensees failing to market products or manage operations could reduce royalty revenue and sales of other products; misuse of brand could harm brand value.",

      "answer": "Nike faces potential adverse effects on sales and financial condition if its licensees or their contractors fail to comply with product safety standards or applicable laws, which could lead to product recalls or reputational harm. Similarly, Starbucks could suffer material negative financial impacts if its licensees fail to meet consumer expectations or regulatory standards, particularly regarding product quality and food safety. Both companies rely on licensees to uphold brand reputation and product integrity, and failures in these areas could lead to significant losses, including recall costs, litigation, and reputational damage.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Nike's 2023 10-K states that failure of licensees' contractors to comply with product safety standards could result in product recalls and reputational harm, adversely affecting sales and financial condition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Starbucks' 2023 10-K warns that licensee failures to meet product safety or brand standards could lead to litigation, regulatory action, and material negative impacts on financial results.",

      "answer": "Nike faces reputational and financial risks if its licensees or their contractors fail to comply with its code of conduct, environmental standards, or product safety regulations. This could lead to product recalls, damage to Nike's brand image, and potential regulatory actions, such as new tariffs or sanctions. In contrast, Starbucks faces operational and financial risks from licensee insolvency, which could result in disrupted operations, market exits, increased bad debt expense, and reputational harm due to negative perceptions of store conditions or service quality.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Nike requires licensees to comply with a code of conduct, environmental standards, and product safety regulations. Failure to comply could harm Nike's reputation, lead to product recalls, and result in regulatory actions such as new tariffs or sanctions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Starbucks faces financial risks if its licensees become insolvent, which could disrupt operations, increase bad debt expense, and harm the company's reputation due to potential service or quality issues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on licensees, but the nature of the risks differs: Nike's risks are primarily reputational and regulatory due to manufacturing practices, while Starbucks' risks are operational and financial due to licensee solvency and service consistency."

      "question": "Nike's three largest international customers (excluding the U.S.) accounted for 15% of its non-U.S. sales in fiscal 2024, while Starbucks relies on licensees for its global Channel Development business. How does the financial risk of concentration in Nike's international licensee/customer base compare to the brand control risk Starbucks faces with its licensees, particularly in international markets?",
      "answer": "Nike faces financial concentration risk as its three largest international customers accounted for 15% of its non-U.S. sales in fiscal 2024. A loss of these key customers could significantly impact Nike's revenue, especially since non-U.S. sales represent 58% of total revenues. In contrast, Starbucks faces brand control risk rather than revenue concentration risk through its licensees, as it authorizes them to use its logos and provide branded products directly to customers. Starbucks lacks direct control over these licensees and may not have visibility into their practices, which could lead to diminished product quality and service, potentially harming its brand value and resulting in a material negative impact on financial results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Nike's three largest international customers accounted for 15% of its non-U.S. sales in fiscal 2024, and non-U.S. sales represent 58% of total revenues.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Starbucks authorizes licensees to use its logos and provide branded products directly to customers, but lacks direct control over their practices, which could lead to diminished product quality and service.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While Nike faces financial concentration risk due to its reliance on a small number of international customers/licensees, Starbucks faces brand control risk due to its reliance on licensees for product quality and service delivery, particularly in international markets."

      "answer": "Supplier financial difficulties pose significant risks to both General Motors and The Home Depot, but in distinct ways based on their supply chain dependencies. For General Motors, the disruptions could affect its 'just-in-time' manufacturing processes, which rely on timely deliveries of systems, components, and raw materials to maintain production schedules. A disruption could lead to production delays, increased costs, or even the suspension of production, which would directly harm profitability and financial condition. For The Home Depot, supplier financial difficulties could hinder its ability to access products that meet its quality standards, as it depends on a global supplier network.

We assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products, systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world.  When these or other facilities become unavailable, either temporarily or permanently and for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions or shortages, supply chain disruptions, the occurrence of a public health crisis or catastrophic weather events, whether or not as a result of climate change, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility has resulted, and may in the future result, in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements and applicable labor agreements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.\n\nIn addition, substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from timeto-time, including at the local facility level. As a result, we may be subject to an increased risk of strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions and employees.\n\nDisruption in our suppliers' operations have disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our production schedule. Our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Other than with respect to certain of our offtake agreements with battery raw material suppliers, our use of 'just-in-time' manufacturing processes typically allows us to maintain minimal inventory. As a result, our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules and specifications. In some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a public health crisis, contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, restrictions on transactions involving certain territories, entities or individuals, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers' operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including the production of certain higher margin vehicles. When we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules, increase work-in-process inventory or suspend production entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues or an increase in working capital, which would adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\n\nPandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises have disrupted our business and operations, and future public health crises could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks in the U.S. or globally, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have previously disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our business, which could materially affect our results of operations,",

      "answer": "In 2024, General Motors (GM) actively reduced its share count by repurchasing and retiring a significant number of shares. Specifically, GM received and retired approximately 29 million additional shares upon settlement of its accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, which initially received 215 million shares in late 2023. Additionally, GM purchased approximately 140 million shares for $7.1 billion during the year. In contrast, The Home Depot (HD) issued additional shares as part of its compensation strategy, particularly through restricted stock units (RSUs) that entitle associates to shares upon vesting. HD's approach involves issuing new shares rather than repurchasing existing ones, reflecting a capital allocation strategy focused on employee incentives rather than returning cash to shareholders through buybacks.",

        "Step 1: From GM's 10-K filing, extract details on the ASR program and share repurchases in 2024, including the 29 million additional shares retired after settlement and the 140 million shares purchased for $7.1 billion.",

Refer to Note 7, Note 13 and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional funding requirements for our operating leases, debt and pension plans. Our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18.0 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to shareholders. Our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our Board of Directors not less than once annually.\n\nWe continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners, as well as strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. To support our transition to EV s, we anticipate making investments in suppliers or providing funding towards the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements to secure critical materials. In addition, we have entered, and plan to continue to enter, into offtake agreements that generally obligate us to purchase defined quantities of output. These arrangements could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.\n\nOur liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&amp;A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, some of which are outside of our control.\n\nIn November 2023, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under our previously announced share repurchase program by $10.0 billion to an aggregate of $11.4 billion and approved a $10.0 billion ASR program. In December 2023, pursuant to the agreements entered into in connection with the ASR, we advanced $10.0 billion and received approximately 215 million shares of common stock with a value of $6.8 billion, which were immediately retired. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we received and retired approximately 29 million additional shares upon settlement of the transactions contemplated under the ASR Agreements. The final number of shares received was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreements, less a discount pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements.\n\nIn June 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization to repurchase up to an additional $6.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, in addition to shares received under the ASR program, we purchased approximately 140 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $7.1 billion. We have $0.3 billion in capacity remaining under our share repurchase program as of December 31, 2024, with no expiration date.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid dividends of $0.5 billion to holders of our common stock. We anticipate that we will continue to declare and pay dividends on our common stock quarterly.\n\nCash flows that occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows. Such eliminations include, among other things, collections by Automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by Automotive to GM Financial, loans to Automotive and Cruise from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive, tax payments by GM Financial to Automotive and Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity, Cruise liquidity and GM Financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.\n\nAutomotive Liquidity Total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.\n\nWe manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. Over 83% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2024. We have used, and will continue to use, other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.",

We assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products, systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world.  When these or other facilities become unavailable, either temporarily or permanently and for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions or shortages, supply chain disruptions, the occurrence of a public health crisis or catastrophic weather events, whether or not as a result of climate change, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility has resulted, and may in the future result, in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements and applicable labor agreements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.\n\nIn addition, substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from timeto-time, including at the local facility level. As a result, we may be subject to an increased risk of strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions and employees.\n\nDisruption in our suppliers' operations have disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our production schedule. Our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Other than with respect to certain of our offtake agreements with battery raw material suppliers, our use of 'just-in-time' manufacturing processes typically allows us to maintain minimal inventory. As a result, our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules and specifications. In some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a public health crisis, contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, restrictions on transactions involving certain territories, entities or individuals, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers' operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including the production of certain higher margin vehicles. When we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules, increase work-in-process inventory or suspend production entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues or an increase in working capital, which would adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\n\nPandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises have disrupted our business and operations, and future public health crises could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks in the U.S. or globally, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have previously disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our business, which could materially affect our results of operations,",

In contrast, LOW uses pricing models based on observable market inputs like benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, and benchmark securities when quoted prices in active markets are not available. GM specifically references foreign exchange and interest rate forward curves, while LOW emphasizes benchmark yields and discounted cash flow analyses for mortgage notes.",

With the exception of long-term debt, cost approximates fair value for these items due to their short-term nature.  As further described in Note 9, certain long-term debt is associated with a fair value hedge, and the changes in fair value of the hedged debt is included in the carrying value of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.

Amazon, while also subject to U.S. state income taxes, focuses on its valuation allowances related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards, which totaled approximately $10.2 billion before tax effects as of December 31, 2023. These losses are subject to annual limitations and may expire starting in 2024, impacting Amazon\u2019s future tax liabilities differently than Starbucks\u2019 repatriation risk.",

      "answer": "Both Amazon and Starbucks rely on trade secret protection as a critical component of their intellectual property strategies to maintain competitive advantages. Amazon emphasizes that its success depends on protecting trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and proprietary technology, which are regarded as critical to its success. However, effective intellectual property protection is not uniformly available in every country where Amazon operates, which could limit its ability to enforce rights and maintain competitive differentiation, especially in international markets. Similarly, Starbucks identifies its brand names, trademarks, and related intellectual property rights as critical assets, and it depends on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, and patents to protect its brand and branded products. However, Starbucks acknowledges that it may not have registered trademarks in all foreign markets where it operates or may operate in the future, which could expose its brand to unauthorized use or weaken its market position. Therefore, the effectiveness of trade secret protection directly influences both companies' abilities to preserve their brand equity, prevent unauthorized use of proprietary assets, and sustain competitive advantages in domestic and international markets.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon relies on trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and proprietary technology as critical to its success and depends on legal protections to maintain these rights globally.",

However, both acknowledge limitations in global enforcement, which could undermine their competitive positioning if proprietary rights are not adequately protected."

      "answer": "Both Amazon and Starbucks identify intellectual property, including trade secrets, as critical to their competitive advantage. Amazon emphasizes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets are essential to its success and that it uses legal protections and confidentiality agreements to safeguard these assets. However, it acknowledges that competitors may adopt aggressive strategies to restrict Amazon\u2019s access to supply or direct consumers away from its platform. Starbucks similarly relies on trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property to protect its brand and branded products, but it highlights the risk that third parties may claim infringement, leading to costly litigation or adverse impacts on its business. If either company fails to adequately protect its trade secrets or faces infringement claims, it could weaken their respective market positions by reducing brand differentiation or increasing legal and operational costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amazon relies on trade secrets, patents, and trademarks as critical to its success and uses legal protections and confidentiality agreements to safeguard these assets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Starbucks relies on trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, and patents to protect its brand and branded products but faces risks related to third-party infringement claims.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies depend on trade secret protection as part of their competitive strategy, but each faces distinct risks: Amazon from competitive pressures limiting access to critical inputs, and Starbucks from potential litigation and brand devaluation due to third-party actions."

      "answer": "HD addresses privacy risks through a robust internal structure, including a 500+ person cybersecurity team led by a certified Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and multiple governance committees overseeing cybersecurity, privacy, and data governance. In contrast, NKE highlights its exposure to international data regulations such as GDPR and China's Personal Information Protection Law, which impose additional compliance burdens and potential penalties. These differing responses reflect HD's proactive, internal governance model versus NKE's regulatory compliance challenges in a globally diverse legal environment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - HD has a cybersecurity team of over 500 associates led by the CISO, who has extensive experience and relevant certifications.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NKE explicitly mentions GDPR, UK GDPR, and China's Personal Information Protection Law as regulatory obligations that increase compliance costs and legal risk.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies face privacy risks, their organizational responses differ significantly: HD emphasizes internal governance and dedicated resources, while NKE focuses on navigating complex, sometimes conflicting, international data laws."

At the Board of Directors (the 'Board') lev el, cybersecurity is ov erseen by the Board and by the Board's Audit Committee, which has primary responsibility for overseeing cybersecurity and priv acy risks. During fiscal 2024, the Board and/or the Audit Committee receiv ed quarterly reports on priv acy, data protection and/or cybersecurity matters from senior information technology ('IT') leaders, including our Chief Information Officer ('CIO') and CISO, as well as the Chair of our Data Security and Priv acy Gov ernance Committee (discussed below). In addition, our Board held a meeting dedicated to cybersecurity topics. Periodically, our Board receiv es presentations on cybersecurity matters from third-party cybersecurity experts.\n\nOur CISO, who reports to our CIO, joined the Company in 2021 after working with the Company as a third-party consultant since 2019. During a nearly two-decade tenure at a leading professional serv ices firm, he worked with clients on managing information security, dev eloping cybersecurity strategy, and implementing effectiv e information and cybersecurity programs and initiativ es addressing emerging cybersecurity threats. Our CISO has significant prior cybersecurity experience, including experience protecting company, customer and associate data across a div erse set of industries. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Systems and has achiev ed sev eral relev ant certifications, including Certified Information Security Manager, Certified Information Systems Security Professional, and Certified Information Priv acy Professional. Our CISO leads a team of ov er 500 associates focused on cybersecurity.\n\nWe have three management-level committees that support our cybersecurity, priv acy and data gov ernance efforts. They are led by our Data Security and Priv acy Gov ernance Committee, which prov ides management-lev el gov ernance ov er cybersecurity matters, including discussion of cybersecurity priorities, emerging risks, awareness and training programs, risk mitigation efforts, and regulatory compliance. This committee is chaired by our Vice President - Internal Audit and Corporate Compliance and is composed of a cross-functional team of senior leaders, including our CEO.

O ur controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential inform ation and intellectual property rights m ight not always be effective. F or exam ple, confidential inform ation related to business strategy, innovations, new technologies, m ergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prem aturely, inadvertently, or im properly used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property rights, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative im pact on our market position, and could lead to dam ages, fines, penalties or injunctions. In addition, new products we offer, such as virtual goods, m ay raise various novel intellectual property law considerations, including adequacy and scope of assignm ent, licensing, transfer, copyright and other right-of-use issues.\n\nI n addition, the laws of certain countries m ay not protect or allow enforcem ent of intellectual property rights to the sam e extent as the laws of the U nited States.

H ackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering, such as phishing, and large-scale, com plex autom ated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of tim e. Any breach of our or our service providers' networks, or other vendor system s, m ay result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, m isappropriation of our consum ers', users' or em ployees' personal inform ation or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcom es could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, including unwanted m edia attention, im pairm ent of our consum er and custom er relationships, dam age to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and consum ers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and rem ediation expenses.

O ur distribution facilities have in the past and could in the future be interrupted by inform ation technology problem s, disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or governm ent actions taken to m itigate their spread. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. W e maintain business interruption insurance, but it m ay not adequately protect us from  adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\n\nWe are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs a m ultinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and m ust com ply with extensive laws and regulations in the U nited States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our em ployees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to com ply with any of these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furtherm ore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict am ong jurisdictions and com pliance in one jurisdiction m ay result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. W e are involved in various types of claim s, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and governm ent investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our em ployees and representatives, including contractual and em ploym ent relationships, product liability, antitrust, tradem ark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcom e of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgm ents, fines or penalties, or enter into settlem ents of lawsuits and claim s that could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively im pact our reputation.

As a result, we are required to exercise our judgm ent as to whether or how certain laws or regulations apply, or m ay in the future apply, and it is possible that legislators, regulators and courts m ay disagree with our conclusions. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert m anagem ent's attention from  our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\n\nChanges to U.S. or other countries' trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges in the U .S. governm ent's im port and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, em bargoes, safeguards or custom s restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nI n addition, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, m anufacturing, developm ent and investm ent in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. U .S. presidential adm inistrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or term ination of trade agreem ents, the im position of higher tariffs on im ports into the U .S., econom ic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other governm ent regulations affecting trade between the U .S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It m ay be tim e-consum ing and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or com ply with any such changes.\n\nChanges or proposed changes in U .S. or other countries' trade policies m ay result in restrictions and econom ic disincentives on international trade. T ariffs and other changes in U .S. trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governm ents have instituted or are considering im posing retaliatory m easures on certain U .S. goods.

      "answer": "The risks posed by international trade quotas and related restrictions have distinct but interconnected implications for both HD and NKE. For HD, the presence of quotas and import-related taxes could disrupt inventory availability by delaying the receipt and delivery of merchandise, impairing the ability to meet customer demand, and potentially resulting in lost sales or increased supply chain costs. This aligns with HD's acknowledgment of supply chain disruptions caused by international trade disputes and restrictions, including quotas, which could affect their ability to maintain product availability and control costs. For NKE, the risk is amplified by the concentration in its manufacturing base, where the top five contract manufacturers account for 51% of Nike Brand apparel production. If quotas or trade restrictions impact the countries where these manufacturers operate, Nike may face a more acute disruption in production capacity and sourcing flexibility, which could lead to increased costs or delays in product availability. Given NKE\u2019s reliance on a small group of manufacturers and HD\u2019s exposure to inventory flow interruptions, both companies face operational and financial risks from trade policy changes, though NKE\u2019s risk is heightened by its sourcing concentration.",

F or fiscal 2024, one apparel contract m anufacturer accounted for m ore than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approxim ately 51% of N IKE  Brand apparel production.\n\nNIKE 's contract m anufacturers buy raw m aterials for the m anufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipm ent products. M ost raw m aterials are available and purchased by those contract m anufacturers in the countries where m anufacturing takes place.\n\nThe principal m aterials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic com pounds, foam  cushioning m aterials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles, as well as polyurethane film s used to m ake N IKE  Air-Sole cushioning com ponents. D uring fiscal 2024, Air M anufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, O regon, in D ong N ai P rovince, Vietnam , and St. C harles, M issouri, as well as contract m anufacturers in C hina and Vietnam , were our suppliers of N I KE  Air-Sole and other cushioning com ponents used in footwear.\n\nThe principal m aterials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized perform ance fabrics designed to efficiently wick m oisture away from  the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and m etal hardware.\n\nFrom  tim e to tim e, certain m aterials used in the production of our products experience periods of high dem and, shortages and price volatility. In fiscal 2024, contract m anufacturers were able to source sufficient quantities of raw m aterials for use in our footwear and apparel products. R efer to Item  1A. R isk F actors, for additional discussion of the im pact of sourcing risks on our business.\n\nSince 1972, Sojitz C orporation of Am erica (\"Sojitz Am erica\"), a large Japanese trading com pany and the sole owner of our redeem able preferred stock, has perform ed im port-export financing services for us.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE\n\nOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the im plem entation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in im port duties, anti-dum ping m easures, quotas, safeguard m easures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political tensions, instability, conflicts, nationalism  and terrorism , and resulting sanctions and other m easures im posed in response to such issues. W e have not, to date, been m aterially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such m aterial effects occurring in the future.\n\nI n recent years, uncertain global and regional econom ic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. T hese trends are affecting m any global m anufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not im m une. C om panies in our industry are facing trade protectionism  in m any different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the im pact to the industry, while observing applicable com petition laws. N otwithstanding our efforts, protectionist m easures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional m easures, if im plem ented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for N IKE , as well as the im ported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.\n\nWe monitor protectionist trends and developm ents throughout the world that m ay m aterially im pact our industry, and we engage in adm inistrative and judicial processes to m itigate trade restrictions. W e are actively m onitoring actions that m ay result in additional anti-dum ping m easures and could affect our industry. W e are also m onitoring for and advocating against other im pedim ents that m ay lim it or delay custom s clearance for im ports of footwear, apparel and equipm ent. N IKE  also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a num ber of bilateral and m ultilateral free trade agreem ents. C hanges in, and responses to, U .S. trade policies, including the im position of tariffs or penalties on im ported goods or retaliatory m easures by other countries, have negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, U .S. corporations, including N IKE , with business operations and/or consum er m arkets in those countries, which could also m ake it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, either of which m ay have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations. In addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and im plem ented (i) addresses legitim ate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers dom estic econom ies and the im portant role they m ay play in the global econom ic com m unity.\n\nWhere trade protection m easures are im plem ented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of tim e, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from  our present suppliers. If events prevented us from  acquiring products from  our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be tem porarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial im pact. H owever, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that m uch of the adverse im pact on supply would, therefore, be of a shortterm  nature, although alternate sources of supply m ight not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse im pact on profitability.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 4",

      "question": "What is the difference in the treatment of incentive stock options between HD and NKE as disclosed in their respective 2024 10-K filings, and how does this affect the vesting schedule for employees?",
      "answer": "HD does not have any incentive stock options outstanding under its plans, and instead primarily uses nonqualified stock options that vest at 25% per year starting on the second anniversary of the grant. In contrast, NKE has a Stock Incentive Plan that includes both non-statutory and incentive stock options, with substantially all awards vesting ratably over four years of continued employment. This difference means that NKE employees benefit from a more standardized and evenly distributed vesting schedule over four years, while HD employees with nonqualified stock options must wait at least two years before any vesting begins, with full vesting taking four years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from HD's 10-K - HD does not have any incentive stock options outstanding and uses nonqualified stock options that vest at 25% per year starting on the second anniversary of the grant.",
        "Step 2: Extract from NKE's 10-K - NKE's Stock Incentive Plan includes incentive stock options and substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of continued employment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The absence of incentive stock options at HD versus their presence at NKE leads to a difference in vesting schedules, with NKE offering a more evenly distributed four-year vesting period and HD requiring a longer initial waiting period before vesting begins."

HD also modified internal control processes during its business transformation initiative involving accounting system upgrades. What specific internal control strengthening mechanism did BKNG expect from SAP implementation, and how does this compare to HD's approach of modifying control processes during system migration?",
      "answer": "BKNG expected stronger internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across the organization through SAP S4 HANA implementation. HD modified the design and implementation of certain internal control processes as part of its ongoing business transformation initiative that includes upgrading and migrating accounting and finance systems. Both companies are enhancing internal controls through system modernization, but BKNG specifically emphasized automation of manual processes while HD focused on iterative control process modifications during system migration.",

For Home Depot, while the 15% minimum tax under the Inflation Reduction Act had no impact on its effective tax rate in fiscal 2023, the company is monitoring the implementation of the OECD's BEPS Pillar Two framework, which will become effective in 2024 and could influence its future tax planning.

Additionally, Tesla earns revenue by selling regulatory credits\u2014$1.78 billion in 2022\u2014to other automakers to help them meet regulatory requirements, including FMVSS-related compliance. Thus, Tesla\u2019s regulatory credit sales provide a financial buffer that could help offset compliance costs, while GM faces potential financial exposure without such a revenue stream if safety defects arise.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Vehicle Safety\n\nU.S. Requirements The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\nOther National Requirements Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe  (UN-ECE)  regulations,  which  are  required  for  the  European  Type Approval process.  Globally,  governments  generally  have  been  adopting  UN-ECE  based  regulations  with  some  variations  to  address  local concerns.  Any  difference  between  North  American  and  UN-ECE  based  regulations  can  add  complexity  and  costs  to  vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. New safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs  and  complexity  to  our  safety  and  field  action  activities  globally.  In  Canada,  vehicle  regulatory  requirements  are  currently aligned  with  U.S.  regulations;  however,  under  the  Canadian  Motor  Vehicle  Safety  Act,  recall  thresholds  are  different  and  the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Further, various governments are beginning to mandate e-Call and other features that can be market-specific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally.\n\nCrash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment Programs Organizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S., rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.\n\nWebsite Access to Our Reports Our internet website address is https://www.gm.com.

          "chunk_text": "## Automotive Regulatory Credits\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles ('ZEVs'), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies\n\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\n\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies\n\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\n\nIn particular, Sections 48 and 25D of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code currently provide a tax credit of 26% of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to decline and/or expire in 2023 and beyond.\n\n## Regulations\n\n## Vehicle Safety and Testing\n\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ('NHTSA'), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards ('FMVSS') and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\n\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer's suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the 'EPA'), and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\n\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, the European Union established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020.\n\n## Self-Driving Vehicles\n\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations specifically pertaining to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.",

      "question": "How do the differing compliance strategies of GM and Tesla with respect to CAFE standards reflect in their respective financial commitments and revenue streams related to electric vehicle production?",
      "answer": "GM has committed over $35 billion through 2025 to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) as part of its strategy to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. This investment supports compliance with global CAFE standards and GHG regulations. In contrast, Tesla generates revenue from the sale of regulatory credits\u2014such as ZEV, greenhouse gas, fuel economy, and clean fuel credits\u2014which provide a financial benefit tied directly to regulatory compliance mechanisms. These differing strategies show that GM is investing heavily in EV production to meet standards, while Tesla monetizes its compliance through credit sales, reflecting two distinct financial pathways to align with CAFE and emissions regulations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GM has committed over $35 billion through 2025 to accelerate its transformation plan focused on electric vehicles to comply with global CAFE and GHG regulations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Tesla earns revenue through the sale of automotive regulatory credits (ZEV, GHG, fuel economy) to other regulated entities, which is recognized as a separate revenue line item in its financial statements.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to CAFE standards, but their financial strategies differ: GM invests capital to meet compliance through electrification, while Tesla monetizes its compliance by selling credits to other automakers."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nfederal  CAFE and GHG rulemakings and related litigation and the finality of CARB's regulatory amendment, in the future GM might be required to meet differing EPA GHG, California GHG and CAFE standards.\n\nCARB  has  also  imposed  the  requirement  that  increasing  percentages  of  Zero  Emission  Vehicles  (ZEVs)  must  be  sold  in California. The Clean Air Act permits states to adopt California emission standards, and 14 have adopted the ZEV requirements. In September 2019, the EPA revoked the waiver it had granted to California that permitted its ZEV program, and NHTSA also asserted preemption of California's ZEV program. Litigation over EPA and NHTSA's actions is currently being held in abeyance, as EPA and NHTSA  have  since  proposed  actions  that  could  result  in  a  restoration  of  California's  ability  to  promulgate  and  enforce  ZEV standards. Depending on any final agency action taken by the EPA and NHTSA, and/or the outcome of the related litigation, there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California ZEV requirements in the future.\n\nIn  Canada,  light-  and  heavy-duty  GHG  regulations  are  currently  patterned  after  the  EPA  GHG  emission  standards  given  the integrated  nature  of  the  auto  sector  between  Canada  and  the  United  States. The  Canadian  government  is  conducting  a  mid-term review of its 2022 to 2025 model year light-duty GHG standards and is considering regulatory developments of the U.S. in this regard. In addition, the Canadian province of Quebec has ZEV requirements regulating the 2018 to 2025 model years largely based on California program requirements and the province of British Columbia's similar ZEV regulations that were completed in July 2020 and cover the 2020 to 2039 model years. Both provinces are further updating their ZEV regulations and the Canadian federal government recently proposed to ban the sale of ICE vehicles in Canada beginning in 2035, although no specific draft regulations have been shared at this time.\n\nChina has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles: an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a fleet  average fuel consumption requirement. With a focus on the fleet average fuel consumption requirement, the China Phase 5 launched in 2021 and full compliance is required by 2025. In addition, China has established a mandate that requires passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, which are referred to as New Energy Vehicles (NEVs), to generate credits in 2019 and beyond. The number of credits per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency, with the goal of increasing NEV volume penetrations and improving technological sophistication over time. Uncommitted NEV credits may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement. China has issued NEV credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and is setting new NEV credit targets aimed at further increasing volumes of NEVs in 2024 and 2025. China has provided various levels of subsidies for NEVs, and certain subsidies have been extended to the end of 2022.\n\nIn Brazil, the Secretary of Industry and Development promulgates and enforces CAFE standards and has enforced a new CAFE program for the period October 2020 to September 2026 and October 2026 to September 2032 for light-duty and mid-size trucks and SUVs, including diesel vehicles, imposing more stringent standards for each period.\n\nWe have several options to comply with existing and potential new global regulations. Such options include increasing production and sale of certain vehicles, such as EVs, and curtailing production of less fuel efficient ICE vehicles; technology changes, including fuel consumption efficiency and engine upgrades; payment of penalties; and/or purchase of credits from third parties. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and GHG regulations.\n\nWe plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 in our global products and operations, supported by a commitment to science-based targets. In addition, the Company announced our vision of an all-electric future and our plan to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new lightduty vehicles by 2035. These targets align with our growth and transformation plan including our commitment to an all-electric future, which will be enabled by our Ultium platform and HYDROTEC technology as previously detailed. We also announced, in June  2021,  our  plans  to  increase  our  investment  in  EVs  and  A Vs  to  more  than  $35.0  billion  through  2025  to  accelerate  this transformation plan.\n\nIndustrial Environmental Control Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.\n\nTo mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment, including climate change, we are embracing sustainability programs focused on reducing operational GHG emissions, water consumption and discharge and waste disposal.",

          "chunk_text": "## Design and Engineering\n\n## Automotive\n\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. Additionally, our team has expertise in selecting and working with a range of materials for our vehicles to balance performance, cost and durability in ways that are best suited for our vehicles' target demographics and utility. We have also used our capabilities to achieve complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and are currently developing designs that integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\n\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design and manufacture our energy generation and storage products and components. We also employ our design and engineering expertise to customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs. We have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process, as well as mounting hardware that facilitates solar panel installation.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nHistorically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we will continue to do so. Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs.\n\n## Automotive\n\n## Direct Sales\n\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\n\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our current sales channels. Sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\n\n## Used Vehicle Sales\n\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer's existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\n\n## Public Charging\n\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient, minimal stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs.\n\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional charging options for our customers. These Destination Charging and workplace locations deploy Tesla Wall Connectors to provide charging to Tesla vehicle owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses. We also work with single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities to deploy home charging solutions.",

      "question": "How do the differing regulatory challenges related to autonomous vehicle development in the U.S. and Europe, as mentioned by General Motors and Tesla, affect their respective strategic approaches to introducing self-driving features in their vehicles?",
      "answer": "General Motors highlights the 'unique technological, operational, regulatory and competitive risks related to the timing and commercialization of autonomous vehicles' as a key risk factor, indicating that regulatory uncertainty could delay or restrict their ability to bring autonomous vehicles to market. Tesla specifically notes that in markets following UNECE regulations, certain requirements 'can compromise or prevent the use' of self-driving features, and that U.S. and European regulations may differ materially from potential regulations in China, increasing legal complexity. Both companies are impacted by regulatory uncertainty, but Tesla explicitly tailors its response to how specific laws in different regions directly constrain feature design and market introduction timelines, while GM emphasizes the broader strategic risks of such regulation on commercialization plans.",

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking  statements  represent  our  current  judgment  about  possible  future  events  and  are  often  identified  by  words  like 'aim,'  'anticipate,'  'appears,'  'approximately,'  'believe,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'designed,'  'effect,'  'estimate,'  'evaluate,' 'expect,'  'forecast,'  'goal,'  'initiative,'  'intend,'  'may,'  'objective,'  'outlook,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'priorities,'  'project,' 'pursue,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'when,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  the  negative  of  any  of  those  words  or  similar  expressions.  In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these  judgments  are  reasonable,  but  these  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  any  future  events  or  financial  results,  and  our  actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be  revised  or  supplemented  in  subsequent  reports  we  file  with  the  SEC,  include,  among  others,  the  following:  (1)  our  ability  to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of  incentives,  and  the  introduction  of  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  by  our  competitors;  (6)  the  unique  technological, operational,  regulatory  and  competitive  risks  related  to  the  timing  and  commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicles;  (7)  risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the  potential  increased  impacts  of  severe  weather  events;  (8)  global  automobile  market  sales  volume,  which  can  be  volatile;  (9) prices  and  uncertain  availability  of  raw  materials  and  commodities  used  by  us  and  our  suppliers,  and  instability  in  logistics  and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique  political,  economic,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks,  including  the  risk  of  changes  in  government  leadership  and  laws (including  labor,  trade,  tax  and  other  laws),  political  uncertainty  or  instability  and  economic  tensions  between  governments  and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates,  economic  downturns  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  differing  local  product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions,  differing  labor  regulations,  requirements  and  union  relationships,  differing  dealer  and  franchise  regulations  and relationships,  difficulties  in  obtaining  financing  in  foreign  countries,  and  public  health  crises,  including  the  occurrence  of  a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (13) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (14) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (15) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; (16) the success of any restructurings or  other  cost  reduction  actions;  (17)  the  possibility  that  competitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (18) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (19) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal  Identifiable  Information  of  our  customers,  employees,  or  suppliers;  (20)  our  ability  to  comply  with  extensive  laws, regulations  and  policies  applicable  to  our  operations  and  products,  including  those  relating  to  fuel  economy,  emissions  and autonomous vehicles; (21) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (22) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (23) any additional tax expense or exposure; (24) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (25) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *",

          "chunk_text": "In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, some requirements restrict the design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.\n\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from those in the U.S. and Europe, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.\n\n## Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\n\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer's ability to deliver or service vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened 'galleries' that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur.\n\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\n\n## Battery Safety and Testing\n\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of 'dangerous goods,' defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.\n\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.\n\n## Solar Energy-General\n\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\n\n## Solar Energy-Net Metering\n\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so.\n\n## Competition\n\n## Automotive\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles' capabilities.",

      "answer": "GM's fleet sales to leasing companies are generally less profitable than retail sales, which directly affects its profitability per vehicle. Tesla, on the other hand, has accounts receivable from leasing companies tied to financing products, and while Tesla does not disclose a specific profitability impact, it does maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to manage the risk of uncollectibility. These differences highlight that GM's exposure affects per-unit profitability, while Tesla's exposure affects cash flow predictability and balance sheet risk management.",

Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in other income (expense), net.\n\nThe cost of available-for-sale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\nWe regularly review all of our marketable securities for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our marketable securities approximates its fair value.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, government rebates already passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $627 million and $46 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.",

These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and increased enforcement and litigation. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services.\n\nFor example, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. In China, the Personal Information Protection Law ('PIPL') has established personal information processing rules, data subject rights, and obligations for personal information processors, among other things. In addition to the PIPL, China's Data Security Law regulates data processing activities associated with personal and non-personal data. Noncompliance with these laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Other newly enacted and proposed privacy and data protection laws in other jurisdictions served by Starbucks and its licensees may impose similar requirements, including restrictions on cross-border data transfers and stringent safeguards on personal and non-personal data. Such laws may impact our business operations and increase the cost and expense of compliance.\n\nIn the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act ('CCPA') requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and allows such consumers to exercise certain rights in connection with their personal information, such as the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective in January 2023, significantly modified the CCPA to include additional compliance obligations. Since the CCPA was first passed, 19 other states have enacted similar data privacy legislation, eight of which are in effect as of the end of 2024. In addition, a number of other states have passed or are considering additional privacy laws, including laws on health data and biometric data that are in effect, or are ex pected to take effect in the near future. These state privacy laws will require us to incur additional costs and ex penses in our efforts to comply.\n\nPrivacy and data protection laws, such as those referenced above, may impact Starbucks operations and new business models, such as Starbucks Digital Solutions, which rely on Starbucks functioning as controller of customer personal information in licensed markets. As such, Starbucks may be primarily responsible for compliance with privacy and data protection laws in the markets served by participating licensees.\n\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals or parties, or fines and damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain may not cover all types of claims that may arise.\n\n## The unauthorized access, use, theft, or destruction of customer or employee data (personal, financial, or other), or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf, could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.\n\nMany of our information technology systems (whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services, rewards programs, and administrative functions, contain personal, financial, or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers, business partners, and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives and designs, and confidential information about third parties, such as licensees and business partners. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems and databases. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future. Our third-party providers' and business partners' information technology systems and databases are likewise subject to such risks. The number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year and increases as the scale and scope of our technology footprint and digital operations increases. In addition, to conduct our business, we provide customer and employee data, as well as Starbucks proprietary information and other confidential information important to our business, to third parties, including licensees and business partners.

In addition, we have significant am ounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investm ents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U nited States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions.

If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations, and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems and related customer support could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\n\nGiven the increasing complexity and sophistication of techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access to or disable information technology systems, and the fact that cyber-attacks are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, it is increasingly difficult to anticipate and defend against cyber-attacks, and a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. Moreover, the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be finalized and completed and reliable information about the incident is known. During the pendency of any such investigation, we may not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and we may be required to disclose incidents before their full ex tent is known.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property or ensure that we are not infringing on the intellectual property of others could harm the value of our brand and our business.\n\nOur brand names, trademarks, and related intellectual property rights are critical assets, and our success depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the markets outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these markets. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, particularly in rapidly evolving areas, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could, particularly in rapidly evolving areas, be time-consuming or result in costly litigation and could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nStarbucks has implemented a cybersecurity program that leverages industry-standard cybersecurity frameworks to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risk. Our cybersecurity program is integrated with the Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') framework and governance processes utilized by management and our Board to oversee our various top enterprise risks. Our internal audit function periodically evaluates our cybersecurity program and selected aspects of it.\n\nWe have implemented various processes and tools to identify cybersecurity threats, detect potential attacks, and protect our data and information technology. We periodically evaluate evolving cybersecurity risks and legal and compliance requirements, and we make ongoing strategic investments to address those evolving risks and requirements.\n\nStarbucks assesses, measures, and reports on cybersecurity risk at operational, program or management, and strategic or executive oversight levels. We maintain and periodically update written cybersecurity policies, standards, and controls, which are reviewed by a cross-functional management-level committee and designed to align with business objectives, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices. We train our employees through annual cybersecurity awareness training, phishing simulations, and periodic communications about timely cybersecurity topics and threats. We also implement a variety of tools to monitor our systems and network activity, and we conduct various simulated attacks and penetration tests to assess the effectiveness of these tools.",

      "answer": "Both NKE and SBUX rely on licensees to maintain brand integrity, but neither has full control over licensee actions. NKE states that misuse of its brand by licensees or negative publicity involving them could have a material adverse effect on its brand value. Similarly, SBUX acknowledges that failures by licensees to meet quality standards or comply with regulations could erode consumer trust and diminish brand value. This shared reliance creates a parallel vulnerability: if licensees under either company fail to uphold brand expectations, both companies face reputational damage and potential financial loss due to reduced consumer trust and sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from NKE's 10-K - 'The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from SBUX's 10-K - 'Failures by our licensees or business providers to comply with the laws or regulations... could erode consumer trust and diminish our brand value.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies explicitly state that they cannot fully control their licensees, and that licensee missteps can directly harm brand reputation. This creates a shared vulnerability where brand value is dependent on third-party performance, which is inherently unpredictable and potentially damaging."

If our licensees fail to successfully m arket and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively m anage their business operations, custom er relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from  reduced royalties received and indirectly from  reduced sales of our other products.\n\nWe also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attem pt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, m erchandising, distribution, advertising and prom otion of our licensed products, we cannot com pletely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees.

In addition, we have significant am ounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investm ents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U nited States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. T he risk of counterparty default or failure m ay be heightened during periods of sustained high interest rates and uncertainty in the financial m arkets as well as econom ic downturns.

Such changes have impacted, and could continue to impact, customer routines, employer 'work-from-home' policies, and consumer behavior, including consumers' ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products.\n\n## If our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand, and our financial results could suffer.\n\nOur global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products, and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensees, joint venture partners, third-party manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers, and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage, and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints or solvency issues, adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance, labor shortages, and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices.\n\nWe also source our food, beverage, and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners, and in certain cases, such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served by foodservice operators who are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice businesses. Failures by our licensees or business providers to comply with the laws or regulations of their markets, or to otherwise meet the standards consumers associate with our brand, may negatively impact our business. Additionally, inconsistent use of our brand and other intellectual property assets, as well as the failure to protect our intellectual property, could erode consumer trust and diminish our brand value, which could result in a material negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Reported incidents involving food- or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, could harm our business.\n\nInstances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food- or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, and/or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, transporting, storing, or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery, and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances, even when false, unfounded, or inaccurate, could materially harm our sales and could lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), temporary store closures, or other adverse consequences. Validated food-safety issues can also result in regulatory action and may lead to a recall of impacted products. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea, and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We continue to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require time and temperature control, including freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food-safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained during manufacturing, storage, distribution to stores, and at stores, due to mechanical malfunction or human error.\n\nWe also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to manufacture finished products, and to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. The product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Potential food safety incidents, whether at our stores, with our products, or involving our business partners, could lead to wide public exposure, regulatory action, and potential litigation, which could materially harm our business.\n\nA widespread Starbucks product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could materially harm our business. A decrease in customer traffic because of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims, or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, could materially harm our business and results of operations. Additionally, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those solely involving the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us, even if no Starbucks suppliers or products are impacted, or the foodservice industry in general.",

A decrease in customer traffic because of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims, or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, could materially harm our business and results of operations. Additionally, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those solely involving the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us, even if no Starbucks suppliers or products are impacted, or the foodservice industry in general.",

      "answer": "GM recognized a total of $881 million in foreign currency cash flow hedge losses in Accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 ($529 million) and 2021 ($352 million) combined.

These loans help utilize funds across global operations as needed. In contrast, Nike employs intercompany transactions as part of its foreign currency risk management program, using forward and option contracts to hedge certain intercompany transactions denominated in non-functional currencies, which helps mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on its consolidated financial statements.",

      "answer": "LOW performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment in fiscal 2021 and concluded that the fair value of the U.S. Home Improvement reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value, indicating no impairment loss was recognized. This means the carrying amount of goodwill remained unchanged for LOW in that year. In contrast, MCD explicitly states that if a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the associated goodwill is written off in its entirety. This leads to direct reductions in MCD's reported goodwill when such sales occur, unlike LOW, which did not experience any such write-offs due to its qualitative findings. Therefore, LOW's asset value on the balance sheet remained unaffected by goodwill impairment in 2021, while MCD's asset value could have decreased due to specific goodwill write-offs tied to early restaurant sales.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - LOW conducted a qualitative assessment in fiscal 2021 and found no goodwill impairment, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value.",

          "chunk_text": "For long-lived assets to be abandoned, the Company considers the asset to be disposed of when it ceases to be used.  Until it ceases to be used, the Company continues to classify the asset as held-for-use and tests for potential impairment accordingly.  If the Company commits to a plan to abandon a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, its depreciable life is evaluated.\n\nGoodwill - Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, in a business combination. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If, after assessing qualitative factors, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed.\n\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Fair value represents the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on a combination of an income approach, based on discounted future cash flows, and a market approach, based on market multiples applied to free cash flow. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Any impairment identified is included within SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. The income tax effect from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit, if applicable, is considered in determining the goodwill impairment loss.\n\nA reporting unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. During fiscal 2021, goodwill was allocated to the U.S. Home Improvement reporting unit. In fiscal 2021, we completed our annual qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for the U.S. Home Improvement reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value.\n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:\n\n",

Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2021-$795.0; 2020-$691.2; 2019-$665.4.\n\nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists, which occurs more regularly throughout the year, such as when new software may be ready for its intended use. The Company did not identify any indicators of impairment of capitalized software for the year ended December 31, 2021. Results for 2020 reflected write-offs of impaired software of $26.3 million.\n\n## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonald's restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office level, and internationally, at a market level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.\n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Company's Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered 'held for sale.\"\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.\n\nThe following table presents the 2021 activity in goodwill by segment:\n\n",

LOW translates foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of its international subsidiaries using period-end exchange rates, with the impact of translation included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity.

The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders' (deficit)/equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.  Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets.  The majority of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions process within two business days and are, therefore, classified as cash and cash equivalents.",

          "chunk_text": "## Fair Value Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in fair values of certain liabilities. The Company enters into fair value hedges that convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into floating rate debt by use of interest rate swaps.  At December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of fixed-rate debt that was effectively converted was an equivalent notional amount of $1.5 billion, which included an increase of $4.8 million of cumulative hedging adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a $31.0 million loss on the fair value of interest rate swaps, and a corresponding gain on the fair value of the related hedged debt instrument to interest expense.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. The hedges cover up to the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $1.3 billion that hedged a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash flows.\n\nBased on market conditions at December 31, 2021, the $24.8 million in cumulative cash flow hedging losses, after tax, is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) as well as foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2021, $12.4 billion of the Company's third party foreign currency denominated debt, $1.4 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, and $477 million of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\n## Undesignated Derivatives\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. Therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. The Company has also used certain derivatives to mitigate the share price risk related to its sale of stock in McDonald's Japan. The changes in the fair value of the undesignated derivatives used for the most recent sale transaction were recognized immediately in earnings in Other operating (income) expense, net. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in Nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2021 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2021, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the Company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') to employees and nonemployee directors.\n\nShare-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses.\n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized each period.\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company's stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\n\nRefer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 58 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

In contrast, MCD did not identify any indicators of impairment for its capitalized software in 2021 and therefore did not record any impairment losses on those assets, despite conducting annual impairment reviews at the field office level (U.S.) and market level (international).

The cash flows related to these contracts are included within financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nCredit Programs and Sale of Business Accounts Receivable - The Company has branded and private label proprietary credit cards which generate sales that are not reflected in receivables.  Under an agreement with Synchrony Bank (Synchrony), credit is extended directly to customers by Synchrony.  All credit program-related services are performed and controlled directly by Synchrony.  The Company has the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement.\n\nThe Company also has an agreement with Synchrony under which Synchrony purchases at face value commercial business accounts receivable originated by the Company and services these accounts.  The Company primarily accounts for these transfers as sales of the accounts receivable.  When the Company transfers its commercial business accounts receivable, it retains certain interests in those receivables, including the funding of a loss reserve and its obligation related to Synchrony's ongoing servicing of the receivables sold.  Any gain or loss on the sale is determined based on the previous carrying amounts of the transferred assets allocated at fair value between the receivables sold and the interests retained. Fair value is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, taking into account the key assumptions of anticipated credit losses, payment rates, late fee rates, Synchrony's servicing costs, and the discount rate commensurate with the uncertainty involved.  Due to the short-term nature of the receivables sold, changes to the key assumptions would not materially impact the recorded gain or loss on the sales of receivables or the fair value of the retained interests in the receivables.\n\nTotal commercial business accounts receivable sold to Synchrony were $4.3 billion in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2020, and $3.2 billion in 2019.  The Company recognized losses of $50 million in 2021, $54 million in 2020, and $41 million in 2019 on these receivable sales, which primarily relates to servicing costs that are remitted to Synchrony monthly.\n\nProperty and Depreciation - Property is recorded at cost.  Costs associated with major additions are capitalized and depreciated.  Capital assets are expected to yield future benefits and have original useful lives which exceed one year.  The total cost of a capital asset generally includes all applicable sales taxes, delivery costs, installation costs, and other appropriate costs incurred by the Company, including interest in the case of self-constructed assets.  Upon disposal, the cost of properties and related accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts, with gains and losses reflected in SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nProperty consists of land, buildings and building improvements, equipment, finance lease assets, and construction in progress.  Buildings and building improvements includes owned buildings, as well as buildings under finance lease and leasehold improvements. Equipment primarily includes store racking and displays, computer hardware and software, forklifts, vehicles, finance lease equipment, and other store equipment . In addition, excess properties held for use are included within land and buildings.\n\nDepreciation is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets.  Assets are depreciated using the straight-line method.  Leasehold improvements and finance lease assets are depreciated and amortized, respectively, over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.  The amortization of these assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment -The carrying amounts of long-lived assets are reviewed whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  A potential impairment has occurred for long-lived assets held-for-use if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets.  The carrying value of a location's asset group includes inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets, and operating liabilities, including inventory payables, salaries payable and operating lease liabilities. Financial and non-operating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group. An impairment loss is recorded for long-lived assets held-for-use when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Impairment losses are included in SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nExcess properties that are expected to be sold within the next twelve months and meet the other relevant held-for-sale criteria are classified as long-lived assets held-for-sale.  Excess properties consist primarily of retail outparcels and property associated with relocated or closed locations.  An impairment loss is recorded for long-lived assets held-for-sale when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.  A long-lived asset is not depreciated while it is classified as held-for-sale.",

McDonald\u2019s held $3.4 billion in CDs as of December 31, 2021, which were included in Cash and equivalents, defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.

We believe these drivers will sustain long-term demand as homeowners invest in repairs and upgrades. Trends such as millennial household formation, the elderly preference to age in place, and the persistence of remote work also support home improvement market demand. While these demand drivers remain supportive, broader market uncertainties also exist around tariffs, tax  policy, and the overall geopolitical environment. We remain focused on delivering strong operating performance, while continuing to make the right long-term investments for growth. This includes executing at a high level through the near-term market pressures by driving productivity, managing costs, and investing in our updated Total Home strategy while continuing to drive sustainable, long-term shareholder value.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings.

          "chunk_text": "## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third-party and intercompany) and foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. A s of December 31, 2024, $13.1 billion of the Company's third-party foreign currency denominated debt, $168 million of the Company's intercompany foreign currency denominated debt and $1.9 billion of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\n## Undesignated Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. Therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A s an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. The Company may also use certain investments to hedge changes in these liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives or investments are recorded in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in non-operating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2024 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in its financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. A t December 31, 2024, the Company was required to post $21 million of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') to employees and nonemployee directors.\n\nShare-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses.\n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized each period.\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company's stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a M onte Carlo valuation model.\n\nRefer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 63 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION\n\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2024-3.6; 2023-4.4; 2022-4.8. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutiv e were (in millions of shares): 2024-1.9; 2023-2.0; 2022-1.5.\n\n## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. A s of December 31, 2024, Cash and equivalents was $1.1 billion of which $451 million consisted of certificates of deposit.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 51",

Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and the report of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, are included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Company is undergoing a multi-year technology transformation which includes updating and modernizing our merchandise selling system, as well as certain accounting and finance systems. These updates are expected to continue for the next few years, and management will continue to evaluate the design and implementation of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting as the transformation continues. No change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 31, 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Item 9B - Other Information\n\nOn March 20, 2025, Marvin R. Ellison, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, adopted a trading plan intended to satisfy Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to sell up to 58,000 shares of the Company's common stock over a period ending on May 29, 2026, subject to certain conditions, including an initial cooling off period before any sales can commence. After the contemplated sales, which Mr. Ellison has stated are for estate planning purposes, Mr. Ellison will continue to have a significant stake in the Company, with the shares subject to the trading plan representing less than 8% of the Company shares beneficially owned by Mr. Ellison, as determined under SEC rules, as well as holding additional performance share units, stock options, and restricted stock awards that remain subject to vesting over the course of his continued employment pursuant to the terms of the awards.\n\n## Item 9C - Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n\nNot applicable.\n\n67",

Operating model transformation will include centralizing or outsourcing certain more routine functions.\n\nThe Company is performing this implementation in the ordinary course of business to increase efficiency and to modernize the tools and technology used in its key financial processes. This is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. A s the phased implementation of the systems continues, the Company has modified certain processes and procedures to enhance the quality of internal control over financial reporting. The Company will continue to monitor and modify, as needed, the design and operating effectiveness of key control activities to align with the updated business processes and capabilities of the new financial systems.\n\nExcept for these changes, the Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, confirm there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S REPORT\n\nManagement's Report and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting are set forth in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\n\nThe following table summarizes information about the Company's equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2024.

      "answer": "BKNG faces financial risk from Payment Card Association Rules through potential liability for compromised information, including expenses, penalties, and restrictions on accepting payment cards. BKNG must also adjust systems and processes with each rule update, incurring additional administrative and compliance costs.

          "chunk_text": "Regulators may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to laws that govern payments activities, such as money transmission and online payments processing, which could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in certain jurisdictions or result in modification of our business plans. Regulations relating to operational resilience, banking, privacy, and security of our processes could also apply to us. Further, our payments systems are susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and transactions by or with sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and failure to maintain compliance could lead to fines or require us to modify or interrupt our business practices, plans, or operations, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and profit margins.\n\nWe are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with the card schemes and our payment card processors, and indirectly to the rules of payment systems in respect of credit (i.e. account to account) transfers. The rules of the card schemes and payment systems are updated in cycles, and we may need to adjust our systems and/or processes to comply with any updated obligations. Card association rules include the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (the \"Standard\"). Under the Standard and these association rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties, and in some cases, we could be restricted in our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances in our agreements with the card schemes and in relation to the Standard, we are also subject to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the rules and obligations of the payment card associations and the Standard, which could result in additional expenses and administrative burdens. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no consumer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Additionally, compliance with the Standard may not prevent all security incidents. If we are fined or required to pay additional processing fees or if our ability to accept payment cards is restricted in any way as a result of our failure to comply with these payment card industry rules, or otherwise, it could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and profit margins.\n\nWe rely on banks, card schemes, and other payment processors to execute certain components of the payments process. For inbound payments, we pay these third parties interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees to help facilitate payments from consumers to travel service providers. As a result, if we are unable to maintain our relationships with these third parties on favorable terms or if these fees are increased for any reason, our profit margin, business, and results of operations could be harmed. Additionally, if these third parties experience service disruptions or if they cease operations (whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise), consumers and travel service providers could have difficulty making or receiving payments, which could adversely impact our reputation, business, and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, in the event that one of our major travel service providers voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy or otherwise ceases or limits operations, we could experience an increase in chargebacks from customers with travel reservations with such travel service provider and we could experience financial loss from certain prepayments made to such travel service provider if we are not able to recover the prepayment. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing effects on travel, many customers canceled flights in exchange for credits for future travel. If customers are not able to use these credits before they expire and we are ultimately responsible for chargebacks directly or through the travel service providers, including situations where we are unable to recover from the travel service providers, it could result in a corresponding negative impact on our results.\n\nIncreased focus on our environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") responsibilities have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks, and may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and partners to do business with us.\n\nInvestors, proxy advisory services, regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices of companies. We are moving towards setting ESG goals and enhancing related disclosure of goals, progress, and other matters relating to ESG. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately disclose ESG-related goals and objectives present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, reputation, and stock price.\n\nOur ability to achieve ESG goals and initiatives is subject to numerous risks including: (1) the availability and cost of limiting or eliminating our use of carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (2) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, (3) our ability to work with partners and providers that can meet our sustainability, diversity, and other standards, (4) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent, (5) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations on our ESG goals, and (6) customers' actual demand for ESG-oriented product offerings, which may be more expensive and less available than other options.",

          "chunk_text": "Cyber attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods. As with many other retailers, we collect, process, transmit, store, and delete certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors, as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary and business, personal and payment card information. Additionally, we use third-party service providers for certain services, such as authentication, content delivery, back-office support, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply chain management, customer service, workforce management, and other functions, and we provide such third-party service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned. We are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties will attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third party providers, or vendors. Certain of our third-party vendors have been subject to disruptions due to ransomware and other cyber attacks. We and our third-party service providers may not be able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to, destruction, misuse, or release of personal information or other sensitive data. It can be difficult to preempt or detect ever-evolving forms of cyber-attacks. A ransomware attack could prevent us or our third-party service providers from accessing data or systems that support Lowe's operations. Our information security or our service providers' information security may also be compromised because of human errors, including by employees, or system errors. Our systems and our service providers' systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes, such as critical infrastructure outages, computer viruses, technology system failures, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, and ransomware. In the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason, we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied. Should these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability, including possible litigation and punitive damages. A security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our third-party service providers' information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach.\n\nData privacy and cybersecurity laws in the United States and internationally are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more complex. In the United States alone, we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its subsequent amendment grants California consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection, use and sharing of 'personal information' of California consumers. Other U.S. states are proposing or have adopted similar laws related to the protection of personal information, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which will go into effect in 2023, and the U.S. federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation. In order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition, we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us. As the regulatory environment relating to retailers' and other companies' obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions or government investigation, and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals, regulators or states' attorney general. Such violation or perceived violation of privacy, including improper collection, use of sharing of personal information, or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy practice, can adversely affect the trust that customers, employees, and business partners have in us related to their personal information.\n\nWe are subject to payments-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, credit accounts, our private label and co-branded credit cards, PayPal, trade credit, gift cards, cash, consumer invoicing and physical bank checks, and we may offer different payment options over time. These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards and promotional financing, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our",

          "chunk_text": "## Our Strategy\n\nWe aim to demonstrate global leadership in online travel and restaurant reservation and related services by:\n\n- providing consumers with the most comprehensive choices and prices at any time, in any place, on any device;\n- making it easy for people to find, book, pay for, and experience their travel desires;\n- offering platforms, tools, and insights to our business partners to help them be successful; and\n- operating our business sustainably and supporting sustainable travel choices by our consumers and partners.\n\nWe focus on relentless innovation and execution and a commitment to serve both consumers and partners with unmatched service and best-in-class technology. Although new variants of COVID-19 continue to make the shape and timing of recovery uncertain, we believe the global online travel and dining industries will gradually return to pre-pandemic levels and consumer purchasing will continue to shift from traditional offline to online channels. As travel demand returns, we expect to benefit from this online growth by expanding our service offerings and markets. In particular, we seek to (a) leverage technology to provide consumers with the best experience, (b) partner with travel service providers and restaurants to our mutual benefit, (c) operate multiple brands that collaborate with each other, and (d) invest in profitable and sustainable growth.\n\n- Provide the best consumer experience. Offering consumers an outstanding online experience is essential to our success. We focus on providing consumers with: (a) intuitive, easy-to-use online travel and restaurant reservation and search services; (b) a comprehensive selection of accommodations, other travel offerings, restaurants and payment options; (c) informative and useful content, such as pictures, accommodation and restaurant details, reviews, and sustainability information; and (d) excellent customer service. Our goal is to make travel easy, frictionless, and personal and to offer consumers the most value, the most trusted brands, the most personalized experience, and the most extensive, varied, and comprehensive travel service selection in every geography. We believe that our continued work to build out our payments capabilities across the Company helps to remove some of the friction in the booking process and enables us to offer additional value for travelers. Further, we endeavor to provide excellent customer service in a variety of ways, including through call centers and online platforms and the use of chatbots and other technologies, so that consumers can be confident that booking reservations through us will be a positive experience.\n\nAlthough the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted in 2021, we continue to innovate and invest in our services in order to emerge from the pandemic in a strong position to meet the needs of consumers and partners. We seek to grow our business through innovation by providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms (i.e., websites and mobile apps) and building stronger relationships with our customers and partners. As a result, we continue to execute against our long-term strategy to build a seamless offering of multiple elements of travel, which we refer to as the \"Connected Trip.\" We believe that through innovation and the utilization of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Connected Trip will simplify and improve all aspects of the travel experience, including discovery, planning, booking, paying, coordinating itineraries among travel service providers, and automatic rescheduling. For example, if a traveler's flight is delayed, we envision that ultimately the Connected Trip will not only alert the traveler, but also automatically arrange for a late arrival at the hotel, change a dinner reservation and alert companion diners, reschedule the car arranged for airport transfer, find a later connecting flight, offer one-click rebooking and payment for any other changes, and manage other impacts from the delayed flight. We believe offering travelers a compelling flight product alongside our other travel products is a key component of our Connected Trip vision. In 2021, we made progress in building out a flight offering at Booking.com, including expanding into 34 countries by the end of the year. We expect that these developments will benefit our travelers, travel service providers, and restaurant partners, as well as provide a compelling and differentiated service offering that will drive enhanced loyalty and frequency over time.\n\n- Partner with travel service providers and restaurants. We aim to establish mutually beneficial relationships with travel service providers and restaurants around the world. We believe that travel service providers and restaurants benefit from participating in our services by increasing their distribution channels, demand, profile and reputation, and inventory utilization in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Travel service providers and restaurants benefit from our trusted brands and marketing efforts, expertise in offering an excellent consumer experience, and ability to offer their inventory in markets and to consumers that they may otherwise be unable or unlikely to reach, for instance due to language or payments services we are able to offer on their behalf.\n- Operate multiple brands. We operate multiple brands, which allows us to offer our services in ways that appeal to different consumers, pursue distinct marketing and business strategies, encourage experimentation and",

          "chunk_text": "Our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\n\nWe form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names. We also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\n\nFailure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell. We also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business. Many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies. If these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly, our business could be adversely affected, at least temporarily, until we are able to replace them.\n\nFailures relating to our third-party installer program or by our third-party installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe contract with third-party installers to provide installation services to our customers, and, as the general contractor, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, including certain licensing and permitting requirements, and those relating to the quality and performance of our third-party installers. Our or our third-party installers' failures to effectively manage such requirements and internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, and may result in the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could negatively affect our business.\n\n## Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\n\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems or the information systems of third-party vendors are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems.\n\nOur efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in, maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing information systems that support operations, such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment. We also engage third-party vendors for a variety of reasons, including for digital storage technology and content delivery. Such vendors may have access to information about our customers, associates, or vendors. Our systems and the systems of third-party vendors are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks and telecommunications failures, or other vulnerabilities and irregularities, and as a result we may incur significant expense, data loss, as well as, an erosion of customer confidence. Additionally, we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption. Our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems.\n\nAs customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences. Access to the Internet from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them. Our websites, including Lowes.com, are a sales channel for our products, and are also a method of making product, project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our in-store sales. Additionally, we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire, inform, cross-sell, establish online communities among, and otherwise interact with our customers, including through online visualization and configuration tools. Performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service, ransomware, or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers' perceptions of Lowe's as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services.\n\nOur business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, employee, vendor, or Company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems, assets and such information.",

Based on these specific cost pressures related to payment card association rules, what are the two distinct types of cost increases both companies face, and how do these compliance and transaction-related burdens combine to impact their financial operations?",
      "answer": "BKNG faces increased compliance costs due to obligations like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard as it expands its payments services. LOW, on the other hand, highlights the risk of rising interchange and transaction fees tied to payment methods such as credit and debit cards, which could raise its operating costs. Together, these cost pressures represent two distinct financial challenges: BKNG\u2019s burden stems from the complexity and expense of meeting regulatory compliance standards, while LOW\u2019s risk lies in the variable and potentially increasing transaction fees imposed by payment card associations. Both types of costs reduce operating margins and require financial and operational investments, thereby constraining profitability and necessitating strategic management of payment-related expenses.",

          "chunk_text": "- meet evolving stakeholder expectations, and support business innovation and growth. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") imposes significant compliance obligations and costs. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") and the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), set to become operative in January 2023, impose new privacy requirements and rights for consumers in California that will result in additional compliance complexity, risks, and costs. Some data protection and privacy laws afford consumers a private right of action against companies like ours for certain statutory violations. In many cases, data protection and privacy laws restrict the transfers of information among our subsidiaries, including employee information.\n- Competition, Consumer Protection and Online Commerce : Competition and consumer protection laws and regulations around the world impact aspects of our business including contractual parity arrangements with accommodation providers and the manner in which we display information on our platform. There is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger, including in relation to the regulation of digital platforms. The European Commission's proposed Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act legislation is expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be \"gatekeepers.\" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to presume that we are a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act as currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption, we would be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed.\n- Regulation of the Travel Industr y: Our business could be impacted by travel-related regulations such as those imposed by local jurisdictions to regulate the use of alternative accommodations and address the issue of \"overtourism.\" As our business evolves, in particular as we offer linked travel arrangements or travel packages as a part of the Connected Trip, we expect to become subject to existing and new regulations. For example, some parts of our business are already subject to certain requirements of the EU Package Travel Directive (the \"Package Directive\"), and as our offerings continue to diversify and expand, we may become subject to additional requirements of the Package Directive.\n- Payment s: As we expand our payments services to consumers and business partners, we expect to become subject to additional regulations, such as financial services regulations and license requirements, which will result in increased compliance costs and complexities, including those associated with the implementation of new or more stringent internal controls. We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with payment card processors, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, compliance with which is complex and costly.\n\nFor further discussion of these regulations and how other global regulations may impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors - \" Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, and Reputational Risks .\"\n\n## Operations and Technology\n\nOur business is supported by multiple systems and platforms, which were designed with an emphasis on scalability, performance, reliability, redundancy, and security. These systems and platforms are generally independent among our brands, though some have become more connected or shared over time. Our software systems, platforms, and architecture use a variety of widely-used software tools and database systems. We are modernizing our technology by building new applications with modern development tools and application programming interfaces and moving certain systems and data to public cloud infrastructure.\n\nThese internal systems and platforms are designed to include open application protocol interfaces that can provide connectivity to vendors in the industries in which we operate. These include large global systems, such as accommodation, flight, and rental car reservation systems, and financial service providers, as well as individual accommodation service providers, such as independent hotels. Our applications utilize digital certificates to help us conduct secure communications and transactions, as appropriate. The systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our worldwide operations are primarily hosted in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, and four locations in the United States, each of which provides network connectivity, networking infrastructure, and 24-hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data centers. All data center facilities have a continuous power supply system, generators, redundant servers, and multiple back-up systems. Although we take steps to mitigate the effects of any loss or reduction in service at one of our hosting facilities, if a hosting facility were inaccessible or otherwise experienced a disruption in service for any reason, we could experience a disruption to our services, loss of transactions and revenue, and consumer complaints.\n\nWe provide customer service through a mix of in-house call centers and outsourced third-party services.",

          "chunk_text": "Cyber attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods. As with many other retailers, we collect, process, transmit, store, and delete certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors, as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary and business, personal and payment card information. Additionally, we use third-party service providers for certain services, such as authentication, content delivery, back-office support, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply chain management, customer service, workforce management, and other functions, and we provide such third-party service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned. We are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties will attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third party providers, or vendors. Certain of our third-party vendors have been subject to disruptions due to ransomware and other cyber attacks. We and our third-party service providers may not be able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to, destruction, misuse, or release of personal information or other sensitive data. It can be difficult to preempt or detect ever-evolving forms of cyber-attacks. A ransomware attack could prevent us or our third-party service providers from accessing data or systems that support Lowe's operations. Our information security or our service providers' information security may also be compromised because of human errors, including by employees, or system errors. Our systems and our service providers' systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes, such as critical infrastructure outages, computer viruses, technology system failures, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, and ransomware. In the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason, we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied. Should these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability, including possible litigation and punitive damages. A security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our third-party service providers' information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach.\n\nData privacy and cybersecurity laws in the United States and internationally are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more complex. In the United States alone, we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its subsequent amendment grants California consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection, use and sharing of 'personal information' of California consumers. Other U.S. states are proposing or have adopted similar laws related to the protection of personal information, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which will go into effect in 2023, and the U.S. federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation. In order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition, we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us. As the regulatory environment relating to retailers' and other companies' obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions or government investigation, and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals, regulators or states' attorney general. Such violation or perceived violation of privacy, including improper collection, use of sharing of personal information, or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy practice, can adversely affect the trust that customers, employees, and business partners have in us related to their personal information.\n\nWe are subject to payments-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, credit accounts, our private label and co-branded credit cards, PayPal, trade credit, gift cards, cash, consumer invoicing and physical bank checks, and we may offer different payment options over time. These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards and promotional financing, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our",

These issues are more difficult to manage during any expansion of the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and may not be adequate to reimburse us for all losses caused by security breaches. Successful attacks could result in significant interruptions in our operations, severe damage to our information technology infrastructure, negative publicity, damage our reputation, and prevent consumers from using our services during the attack, any of which could cause consumers to use the services of our competitors, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands, our market share, business, and results of operations.\n\nWe use both internally-developed systems and third-party systems to operate our services, including transaction processing, order management, and financial and accounting systems. If the number of consumers using our services increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems, financial and accounting systems, or other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and, depending on the systems affected, our transactional, financial, and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time before upgrade, expansion, or repair. Many of our processes and systems, including those related to processing and recording revenue, are highly automated and involve multiple inputs from various IT systems, which can mitigate the risk of human error but which can also make testing, troubleshooting, and auditing more difficult. As a result, it may be difficult to quickly detect and correct errors embedded in these processes or systems.\n\nOur business relies on a global supply chain of third party services providers and we are exposed to risks because we rely on the resilience, security, and legal compliance of their product and services.\n\nWe rely on certain third-party computer systems and third-party service providers, including GDSs and computerized central reservation systems of the accommodation, rental car, and airline industries in connection with providing some of our services. Any damage to, breach of or interruption in these third-party services and systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking related accommodation, rental car, and airline reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business, brands, and results of operations. Our agreements with some third-party service providers are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruptions. In the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms and, as a result, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nConsumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet, and any publicized security problems could negatively affect consumers' willingness to provide private information or effect online commercial transactions generally, including through our services. Some of our business is conducted with third-party marketing affiliates, which may generate travel reservations through our infrastructure or through other systems. A security breach at any third-party, such as the security breach experienced by MGM Resorts International in 2020, could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and could result in negative publicity, subject us to notification requirements, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, even if we had no direct involvement in the breach. In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements or with parameters within which we permit them to process data, which could expose us to liability.\n\nWe depend upon various third parties to process payments, including credit cards, for our merchant transactions around the world. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide credit card numbers which we use as a payment mechanism for merchant transactions. If any such third party were wholly or partially compromised or ceased or suspended operations, our cash flows could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transactions (and related revenues) for a period of time and this could have a negative effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations and, in certain cases of the insolvency of such a partner, could result in additional payments by us and loss of the total transaction value.",

          "chunk_text": "Cyber attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods. As with many other retailers, we collect, process, transmit, store, and delete certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors, as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary and business, personal and payment card information. Additionally, we use third-party service providers for certain services, such as authentication, content delivery, back-office support, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply chain management, customer service, workforce management, and other functions, and we provide such third-party service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned. We are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties will attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third party providers, or vendors. Certain of our third-party vendors have been subject to disruptions due to ransomware and other cyber attacks. We and our third-party service providers may not be able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to, destruction, misuse, or release of personal information or other sensitive data. It can be difficult to preempt or detect ever-evolving forms of cyber-attacks. A ransomware attack could prevent us or our third-party service providers from accessing data or systems that support Lowe's operations. Our information security or our service providers' information security may also be compromised because of human errors, including by employees, or system errors. Our systems and our service providers' systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes, such as critical infrastructure outages, computer viruses, technology system failures, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, and ransomware. In the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason, we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied. Should these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability, including possible litigation and punitive damages. A security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our third-party service providers' information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach.\n\nData privacy and cybersecurity laws in the United States and internationally are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more complex. In the United States alone, we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its subsequent amendment grants California consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection, use and sharing of 'personal information' of California consumers. Other U.S. states are proposing or have adopted similar laws related to the protection of personal information, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which will go into effect in 2023, and the U.S. federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation. In order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition, we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us. As the regulatory environment relating to retailers' and other companies' obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions or government investigation, and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals, regulators or states' attorney general. Such violation or perceived violation of privacy, including improper collection, use of sharing of personal information, or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy practice, can adversely affect the trust that customers, employees, and business partners have in us related to their personal information.\n\nWe are subject to payments-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, credit accounts, our private label and co-branded credit cards, PayPal, trade credit, gift cards, cash, consumer invoicing and physical bank checks, and we may offer different payment options over time. These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards and promotional financing, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our",

      "question": "How does Amazon's equity investment in Rivian and General Motors' strategic focus on EVs reflect differing financial and strategic approaches to the electric vehicle market, and what implications does this have for their respective competitive positioning?",
      "answer": "Amazon's equity investment in Rivian of $15.6 billion, which was subject to both regulatory and contractual sales restrictions through Q2 2022, indicates a significant but constrained financial commitment to the EV market through a strategic partner. In contrast, General Motors has committed over $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025 directly into its own EV and AV technologies, aiming to launch more than 30 new EV models globally. This reflects a fundamentally different strategic approach: Amazon is leveraging Rivian as an external innovation partner while maintaining limited control, whereas GM is vertically integrating its EV capabilities with massive internal investment. Given GM's need to fund new product development cycles that can take two years or more and its high fixed costs due to legacy operations and union agreements, its approach carries higher execution risk but also greater long-term control. Amazon's investment, while large, is more flexible and less operationally entangled, potentially allowing it to pivot more easily if Rivian underperforms or market conditions shift.",

Risk Factors\n\nWe  have  listed  below  the  most  material  risk  factors  applicable  to  us.  These  risk  factors  are  not  necessarily  in  the  order  of importance or probability of occurrence:\n\n## Risks related to our competition and strategy\n\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will  continue  to  experience  significant  change  in  the  coming  years,  particularly  as  traditional  automotive  original  equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the  entrance  of  start-ups  and  other  non-traditional  competitors  in  the  automotive  industry.  These  new  competitors,  as  well  as established  industry  participants,  are  disrupting  the  historic  business  model  of  our  industry  through  the  introduction  of  new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer  sales channels, methods  of  transportation  and  vehicle  ownership.  To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that  are  outside  of  our  historically  core  ICE  business,  such  as  EVs  and A Vs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.\n\nOur vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any constraints  on  lending  due  to  concerns  about  climate  change,  our  ability  to  execute  on  our  strategic  plans  could  be  adversely affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\n\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\n\nOur ability  to  maintain  profitability  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  timely  fund  and  introduce  new  and  improved  vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with market  participants  routinely  introducing  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  and  features  designed  to  meet  rapidly  evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility  to  adjust  personnel  costs  to  changes  in  demands  for  our  products,  may  further  exacerbate  the  risks  associated  with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\n\nOur  long-term  strategy  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  profitably  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  EVs. The  production  and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future.  In  2021,  we  increased  our  commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV strategy  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  high-quality  EVs  that  are  competitive  and  meet  consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.",

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2021, Amazon's equity investment in Rivian had a fair value of $15.6 billion. GM's 2022 10-K filing highlights the intensifying competition in the EV market, with new entrants like Rivian disrupting traditional automotive business models through innovations in EVs and direct-to-consumer sales channels. GM notes that maintaining profitability depends on timely introduction of competitive EVs, reducing battery costs, and scaling software-enabled services. Given that Rivian is a direct competitor in the EV space and Amazon has a significant ownership stake in Rivian, any failure by Rivian to execute on product development, scale production, or compete effectively against established automakers like GM could reduce the long-term strategic value of Amazon\u2019s investment. This is compounded by GM\u2019s $35.0 billion investment in EV and AV technologies through 2025, which signals a strong push to capture market share and could pressure Rivian\u2019s position in the market.",

GM\u2019s aggressive EV strategy and the competitive pressures it describes suggest that Rivian may face significant challenges in maintaining or increasing its market position, which could negatively impact the long-term value of Amazon\u2019s investment."

      "question": "How does Amazon's strategic investment and commercial agreement with Rivian contrast with General Motors' approach to electric vehicle production, particularly in terms of ownership structure and regulatory exposure?",
      "answer": "Amazon holds an 18% ownership interest in Rivian and accounts for the investment under the fair value option, which allows it to recognize valuation gains such as the $11.8 billion gain in 2021. This equity stake, combined with a commercial agreement to purchase electric vehicles, gives Amazon strategic alignment with Rivian's EV development without directly managing production or bearing full regulatory compliance costs. In contrast, General Motors is internally scaling its EV production under significant regulatory pressure to meet fuel economy and GHG emission standards, which may require substantial investment, limit profitable product offerings, and expose GM to compliance penalties. GM does not have an external equity stake in an EV manufacturer but instead bears full responsibility for regulatory risks and capital costs associated with in-house EV development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon's 18% ownership in Rivian and $11.8 billion valuation gain in 2021 from the equity investment, which is accounted for under the fair value option.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - General Motors faces regulatory requirements that could require substantial investment, limit profitable product offerings, and expose the company to compliance penalties as it scales internal EV production.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amazon's external investment model with Rivian allows strategic alignment with EV adoption while avoiding full regulatory and capital burden, whereas GM is directly exposed to regulatory and financial risks of internal EV production."

However,  hackers  have  reportedly  attempted,  and  may  attempt  in  the  future,  to  gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. Laws that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our customers  and  reducing  customer  trust  and  confidence  in  our  products.  In  addition,  regardless  of  their  veracity,  reports  of unauthorized  access  to  our  vehicles  or  their  systems  could  negatively  affect  our  brand  and  harm  our  reputation,  which  could adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nOur enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of our customers, employees and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions . Under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting  in  civil  or  criminal  penalties,  as  well  as  brand  impact  or  other  harm  to  our  business.  In  addition,  increased  consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations on companies to quickly respond to consumer requests, such as requests to delete, disclose and stop selling personal information, with significant fines for noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.\n\n## Risks related to government regulations and litigation\n\nOur  operations  and  products  are  subject  to  extensive  laws,  regulations  and  policies,  including  those  related  to  vehicle emissions  and  fuel  economy  standards,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  costs  and  affect  how  we  do  business. We  are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and  affect  our  product  portfolio,  particularly  regulations  relating  to  fuel  economy  standards  and  GHG  emissions.  Meeting  or exceeding the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of internal combustion  propulsion  in  certain  major  jurisdictions,  and  these  standards  are  often  not  harmonized  across  jurisdictions.  We anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically, fuel economy and GHG emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit the sale of certain profitable products, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes, pay  penalties  or  undertake  other  activities  that  may  require  us  to  incur  additional  expense,  which  may  be  material.  These requirements  may  increase  the  cost  of,  and/or  diminish  demand  for,  our  vehicles.  These  regulatory  requirements,  among  others, could  significantly  affect  our  plans  for  global  product  development  and,  given  the  uncertainty  surrounding  enforcement  and regulatory  definitions  and  interpretations,  may  result  in  substantial  costs,  including  civil  or  criminal  penalties.  In  addition,  an evolving but un-harmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sales mandates may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect our revenues. Refer to the 'Environmental and Regulatory Matters' section of Item 1. Business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements.\n\nWe expect that to  comply  with  fuel  economy  and  GHG  emission  standards  and  mandates  to  sell  specific  volumes  of  ZEV  in certain  jurisdictions,  we  will  be  required  to  sell  a  significant  volume  of  EVs,  and  potentially  develop  and  implement  new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all of which will require substantial investment and expense. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of  available  technologies,  lack  of  sufficient  consumer  acceptance  of  new  technologies  and  of  changes  in  vehicle  mix,  lack  of willingness  of  consumers  to  absorb  the  additional  costs  of  new  technologies,  the  appropriateness  (or  lack  thereof)  of  certain technologies  for  use  in  particular  vehicles,  the  widespread  availability  (or  lack  thereof)  of  supporting  infrastructure  for  new technologies, especially for EVs, and the human, engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with current or future regulatory requirements.\n\nIn the current uncertain regulatory framework, compliance costs for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of fuel economy or emission standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall of  one  or  more  of  our  products,  negotiated  remedial  actions,  fines,  restricted  product  offerings  or  a  combination  of  any  of  those items. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and operations, including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.",

As  a  result,  we  have committed to making total EV and AV investments of more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025.\n\nWe have an opportunity to grow our vehicle and financing revenue by continuing to capitalize on the strength of our franchises and scaling our EV production and customer base over the next decade. We also have the potential of growing our revenue through our software-enabled services and subscriptions, including OnStar, our advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), Super Cruise, and  future  offerings,  such  as  our  next-generation  ADAS,  Ultra  Cruise,  and  Ultifi.  Additionally,  we  are  incubating  several  new businesses with a start-up mindset that we believe will enable us to attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas.\n\nElectric Vehicles We plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our all-new dedicated battery electric platform. Our first Ultium-based products launched with the GMC HUMMER EV and BrightDrop EV600 in  2021,  to  be  followed  by  the  Cadillac  LYRIQ  in  2022. This  all-new  platform  is  flexible  and  will  be  leveraged  across  multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design and development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles.\n\nIn September 2021, we announced three new drive assist motors as part of Ultium Drive, calibrated in-house to ensure the highest level of performance in Ultium-based EVs. We designed the motors as a scalable family, sharing design principles as well as similar tooling and manufacturing strategies.\n\nIn November 2021, we began production at GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which was re-tooled into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV and the upcoming Cruise Origin and Chevrolet Silverado EV, which we revealed in January 2022 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. In January 2022, we announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the  electric  GMC  Sierra. Additionally,  we  have  announced  plans  to  mass-produce  battery  cells  for  these  and  other  future  EVs through Ultium Cells LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Lordstown, Ohio, Spring Hill, Tennessee and Lansing, Michigan. A fourth U.S.-based battery cell plant is also planned by mid-decade.\n\nTo  support  mass  market  adoption  of  EVs,  we  are  working  to  ensure  that  our  customers  will  have  access  to  comprehensive charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at home, the workplace and in public locations.  For  fleet  vehicles,  this  means  turnkey  charging  solutions  and  fleet  and  facility  energy  management  services. We  have announced collaborative work with several charge network operators to filter real-time data on their respective",

      "answer": "Booking Holdings Inc. has one Indenture agreement dated September 23, 2014, with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, while NIKE, Inc. has four Indenture agreements dated April 26, 2013, October 21, 2016, March 27, 2020, and October 29, 2015 (supplemental). This results in a total of five distinct Indenture agreements. Booking Holdings' agreement includes a 2.375% Senior Note due 2024, whereas NIKE\u2019s agreements include a broader structure with notes due in 2025, 2026, 2027, 2030, 2040, and 2050, with varying interest rates such as 2.400%, 2.750%, 2.850%, 3.250%, and 3.375%.",

      "question": "How does the implementation of the 15% global minimum tax impact both Booking.com's operational strategy in the Netherlands and Nike's U.S. tax obligations, and what specific tax treatments are affected for each company?",
      "answer": "The implementation of the 15% global minimum tax negatively impacts Booking.com's operational strategy by threatening its eligibility for the Netherlands' Innovation Box Tax benefit, which historically taxed qualifying innovative activities at 9% (reduced to 7% prior to 2021), significantly below the Dutch statutory rate of 25.8%. If Booking.com fails to secure the required R&D certificate, it may lose this preferential tax treatment, increasing its effective tax rate. Meanwhile, Nike is subject to the U.S. 15% minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income, effective June 1, 2023. Although Nike determined this change did not have a material impact on its fiscal 2024 financial statements, the tax restructuring increases the likelihood that foreign earnings will be taxed in the U.S. under Subpart F, prompting Nike to recognize a 4.7% deferred income tax benefit to offset future taxable income.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Booking.com benefits from the Netherlands' Innovation Box Tax at 9% (2021) and 7% (pre-2021), significantly below the 25.8% statutory rate, but faces risk of losing this benefit due to complex international tax changes including the 15% global minimum tax.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Nike is subject to the 15% U.S. minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income, effective June 1, 2023, with a 4.7% deferred tax benefit recognized due to tax restructuring increasing the likelihood of U.S. taxation of foreign earnings under Subpart F.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by the 15% minimum tax, but in different jurisdictions and with distinct tax treatments: Booking.com risks losing its preferential Dutch tax rate, while Nike faces U.S. tax exposure on foreign earnings despite a deferred benefit."

      "answer": "BKNG does not intend to indefinitely reinvest its international earnings that were subject to U.S. taxation under the mandatory deemed repatriation or GILTI provisions. This implies that BKNG has accounted for potential U.S. tax liabilities on these earnings, contributing to its valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which was $114 million at December 31, 2023. NKE, on the other hand, benefits from a tax holiday in certain foreign jurisdictions that is set to expire in 2031, providing a tax benefit of $338 million in fiscal 2024. However, NKE also faces uncertainty in its U.S. and foreign tax positions, with $990 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $699 million would affect its effective tax rate if recognized. The combined impact of these differing U.S. taxation treatments results in BKNG carrying a higher valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, while NKE benefits from a long-term tax holiday that reduces its current tax liability but faces potential future liabilities from unresolved audit issues.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BKNG does not intend to indefinitely reinvest its international earnings subject to U.S. taxation under mandatory deemed repatriation or GILTI, and has a valuation allowance of $114 million on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NKE benefits from a tax holiday that provided a $338 million tax benefit in fiscal 2024, and has $990 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits, with $699 million affecting the effective tax rate if recognized.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BKNG's U.S. taxation treatment leads to a more conservative deferred tax asset valuation, while NKE leverages a tax holiday to reduce current liabilities but faces potential future tax exposure from unresolved audit issues. These differences reflect contrasting impacts of U.S. international tax policy on their financial positions."

This strategy is directly tied to enhancing customer experience and increasing global store expansion, which is expected to drive long-term shareholder value. In contrast, Tesla focuses on being an employer of choice by offering best-in-industry benefits and impactful jobs, with the goal of accelerating the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. Tesla\u2019s approach is integrated with its broader ESG goals, including factory efficiency, supply chain sustainability, and worker safety, which are expected to support its growth in electric vehicles and energy products.

Similarly, Tesla faces significant challenges in hiring, training, and retaining qualified employees for its new factories, which are critical for manufacturing high-quality vehicles at scale.

      "answer": "BKNG reported $536 million in U.S. state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards as of December 31, 2021. These NOLs can be used to offset future state taxable income, thereby reducing BKNG's future state tax liability. In contrast, SBUX disclosed that if it repatriates international earnings to the U.S., it may be subject to material U.S. state income taxes. Unlike BKNG, SBUX did not specify any NOL carryforwards to offset such potential liabilities, suggesting that SBUX may face higher effective state tax costs on repatriated earnings compared to BKNG, which has significant NOLs available.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - BKNG's substantial NOLs can reduce its future U.S. state tax liability on repatriated earnings, whereas SBUX lacks such a stated offset and may face higher effective state tax costs under similar repatriation scenarios."

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Tax Reform\n\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years.\n\nIn 2018, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $46 million to adjust its provisional income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, as well as U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation. In addition, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $2 million in 2018 to adjust the remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate that resulted from the Tax Act.\n\nIn 2019, as a result of additional technical guidance issued by U.S. federal and state tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $17 million to adjust its income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, as well as U.S. state income taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation.\n\nIn 2020, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $8 million to adjust its income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability. This benefit was primarily due to additional tax credits. The Company utilized $108 million of deferred tax assets related to U.S. federal net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and $115 million of other tax credit carryforwards to reduce its transition tax liability as of December 31, 2021.\n\nUnder the Tax Act, the Company's future cash generated by the Company's international operations can generally be repatriated without further U.S. federal income tax, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by the Company.\n\nThe Tax Act also introduced in 2018 a tax on 50% of GILTI, which is income determined to be in excess of a specified routine rate of return, and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\") aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base. The Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat taxes on GILTI as period costs.\n\n## Deferred Income Taxes\n\nThe Company utilized $309 million of its U.S. NOLs to reduce its U.S. federal tax liability for the deemed repatriation tax. After utilization of available NOLs, at December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal NOLs of $267 million, the majority of which do not have an expiration date, and U.S. state NOLs of $536 million, which mainly begin to expire in years December 31, 2032 and forward. In addition, at December 31, 2021, the Company had $700 million of non-U.S. NOLs, and $23 million of U.S. research tax credit and foreign tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future tax liabilities, the majority of which do not have an expiration date.\n\nThe utilization of these NOLs, allowances, and credits is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and the tax laws in the jurisdictions where the losses were generated. The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of the deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, tax planning strategies, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.",

In contrast, SBUX faced reduced foot traffic in physical retail locations as more consumers worked remotely, directly affecting in-store sales. These shared work-from-home dynamics create opposing pressures: BKNG faces rising labor costs from talent scarcity in a competitive hiring market, while SBUX sees lower in-store demand due to reduced customer presence near its locations.",

We also publish our consolidated EEO-1 report for employees in the United States (which represents approximately 17% of our workforce as of December 31, 2021).\n\nWe support equality and inclusivity across our workforce through various initiatives at all the brand companies. For example, Booking.com has several employee resource groups including: B.Proud to support the LGBTQ community and its allies; B.Able to support employees with differing physical and mental abilities; B.Bold to support the Black and persons-of-color (POC) community; and B.Equal to support gender equality. Agoda supports employee resource groups aimed at fostering greater workplace inclusion with initiatives such as the Agoda Colors and Women at Agoda. At Priceline, the Women Impacting Priceline resource group empowers women to champion their professional development and improve gender intelligence. KAYAK and OpenTable support their employees through employee resource groups, including communities for women, people of color, people with disabilities, veterans, and LGBTQ, which promote increased inclusion and engagement. We are proud of the progress we have made in this space and recognize we can always improve. As part of recruitment, we have provided training to ensure interviewers consider all candidates objectively. Our brands are pursuing various efforts to ensure that candidate slates are diverse. We have deployed unconscious bias training and have encouraged leadership at our brands to participate in diversity and inclusion workshops and reviews to ensure that these tenets are core to our strategy. Additionally, we are entering our sixth year of operating our Women in Leadership program, which is a Company-wide initiative designed to support the advancement and development of high-performing women within the Company with the goal of building and enabling gender diversity in our executive pipeline.\n\n## Attraction, Development, and Retention\n\nWe work diligently to attract the best and most innovative talent from a diverse range of sources to grow our business and achieve our long term strategic goals. We believe that we offer a rich culture where employees feel included and empowered to do their best work with opportunities to grow as well as competitive compensation and benefits. For example, while the specifics can vary by brand, in the United States our employee benefit plans generally include: coverage for infertility treatments, gender reassignment surgery, gender-neutral domestic partner benefits, and paid parental leave.\n\nDespite the challenges of shifting the vast majority of our workforce to work-from-home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to prioritize and invest in creating opportunities for employees to grow and build their careers through training and development programs. These include offering tailored learning opportunities to enable employees to upskill while at work and driving frequent career conversations between employees and their managers, as well as executive talent and succession planning.\n\nCompetition for talent in our industry has historically been intense. However, with the proliferation of global working from anywhere policies and the associated increased ability for employees to seek out and switch jobs that may not have been accessible to them previously, the competition for employees, particularly software engineers, mobile communications talent, and other technology professionals, has intensified. This is further exacerbated by the greater impact of COVID-19 on the travel industry versus other industries that employ technology talent that were not as directly impacted as travel. As a result, we have experienced increased costs associated with attracting and retaining our employees. We continue to focus on our employees' engagement and mental well-being, career satisfaction, and development and succession planning.\n\nWe recognize that expectations for the ways and places in which employees work have shifted dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As our brand companies have considered hybrid and flexible work-from-home policies for the longer term, we have continued to adhere to our principles of keeping employees safe and engaged. We have been flexible with how we form these policies for our various brands as we encounter new health-related information or emerging expectations in certain markets. Each of our brands has taken their own tailored approach to working policies that takes into account geographic location and the needs of current and prospective employees. A number of our brands have adopted or are exploring more flexible work arrangements, including hybrid work from office and home flex programs, and evaluating long-term fully remote arrangements.\n\nWe measure organizational culture and engagement so we can be responsive to our employees' needs. The disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have presented unique challenges to keeping employees engaged and supported at work. We shifted our approach to employee engagement in response to changing employee needs in a mostly-virtual workplace, by, for example, providing regular video-based CEO updates, virtual mental wellness workshops, and free access to a meditation app and telehealth services. We regularly connect with our employees through formal engagement surveys, work-from-home surveys, and quick pulse surveys to request feedback on the employee experience. The results of these efforts are shared with senior management at each of our brands who analyze areas of progress or prioritize areas for improvement in order to encourage and sustain employee engagement. We are proud that, notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19 on our",

If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\n## \u00b7 Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to 'brick &amp; mortar' retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs, the Starbucks Odyssey experience and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines, changes to employer 'work-from-home' policies, reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Tax Reform\n\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years.\n\nIn 2018, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $46 million to adjust its provisional income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, as well as U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation. In addition, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $2 million in 2018 to adjust the remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate that resulted from the Tax Act.\n\nIn 2019, as a result of additional technical guidance issued by U.S. federal and state tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $17 million to adjust its income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, as well as U.S. state income taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation.\n\nIn 2020, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $8 million to adjust its income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability. This benefit was primarily due to additional tax credits. The Company utilized $108 million of deferred tax assets related to U.S. federal net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and $115 million of other tax credit carryforwards to reduce its transition tax liability as of December 31, 2021.\n\nUnder the Tax Act, the Company's future cash generated by the Company's international operations can generally be repatriated without further U.S. federal income tax, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by the Company.\n\nThe Tax Act also introduced in 2018 a tax on 50% of GILTI, which is income determined to be in excess of a specified routine rate of return, and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\") aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base. The Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat taxes on GILTI as period costs.\n\n## Deferred Income Taxes\n\nThe Company utilized $309 million of its U.S. NOLs to reduce its U.S. federal tax liability for the deemed repatriation tax. After utilization of available NOLs, at December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal NOLs of $267 million, the majority of which do not have an expiration date, and U.S. state NOLs of $536 million, which mainly begin to expire in years December 31, 2032 and forward. In addition, at December 31, 2021, the Company had $700 million of non-U.S. NOLs, and $23 million of U.S. research tax credit and foreign tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future tax liabilities, the majority of which do not have an expiration date.\n\nThe utilization of these NOLs, allowances, and credits is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and the tax laws in the jurisdictions where the losses were generated. The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of the deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, tax planning strategies, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.",

The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. Our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment testing, which was completed in the third fiscal quarter, resulted in an estimated fair value of our reporting units where a quantitative assessment was performed, was in excess of carrying value of approximately $95 billion for the business units where a quantitative analysis on impairment was performed. When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.\n\nDefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, taxplanning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss).\n\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, we do not expect a significant amount of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized by the end of fiscal 2023 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities.\n\nWe have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated.

      "answer": "BKNG uses market approaches, such as EBITDA multiples of comparable publicly traded companies, as part of its goodwill impairment testing, combining them with an income approach (discounted cash flows) to determine the fair value of reporting units. SBUX also uses market approaches when evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets, applying valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies alongside discounted cash flow models. However, BKNG specifically adopted a new accounting standard in 2020 that changed the measurement of goodwill impairment to the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not exceeding the carrying amount of goodwill. In contrast, SBUX focuses on qualitative assessments first and uses market multiples in a less prescriptively defined manner, relying on internal projections and judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values. This highlights a difference in both the timing of market approach application and the specificity of valuation guidance followed.",

The Company has operating leases for office space, data centers, and land for Booking.com's future headquarters. For office space, data centers, and land, the Company has elected to combine the fixed payments to lease the asset and any fixed non-lease payments (such as maintenance or utility charges) when determining its lease payments.\n\nThe Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as its discount rate to determine the present value of its remaining lease payments to calculate its lease assets and lease liabilities because the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate the Company would pay to borrow in the currency of the lease payments on a collateralized basis for the weighted-average life of the lease. Operating lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received prior to lease commencement.\n\nThe Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of the Company's lease agreements include rent payments which are adjusted periodically for inflation. Any change in payments due to changes in inflation rates are recognized as variable lease expense as they are incurred. Variable lease expense also includes costs for property taxes, insurance, and services provided by the lessor which are charged based on usage or performance (such as maintenance or utility charges).\n\nMost leases have one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the initial lease term for various periods up to nine years. The exercise of renewal options for office space and data centers is at the Company's discretion and are included if they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The land lease for Booking.com's future headquarters has an initial term which expires in 2065, at which time the lease payments will be adjusted based on the value of the land on the reassessment date. The Company considered the initial term of the land lease to be its expected period of use.\n\n\"Operating lease assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes the land-use rights related to payment in 2016 for the land lease for Booking.com's future headquarters as described above. The land-use rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected period of use. This expense is recorded as lease expense in \"General and administrative\" expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Notes 16 for further information.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill at a reporting unit level. The fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair values are determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approaches (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") multiples of comparable publicly traded companies) and based on market participant assumptions. For periods prior to January 1, 2020, an impairment was recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill. The Company adopted the accounting standards update on goodwill impairment in the first quarter of 2020, under which a goodwill impairment loss is measured at the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 11 for further information.",

When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.\n\nLong-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store's assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses.\n\nOur impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store's historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store's performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store's ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded an immaterial impairment charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. Future impairment charges attributed to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to reposition our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by pursuing strategic store closures and focusing on new store formats that better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During fiscal year 2021, we recorded approximately $155.4 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. These totals included $53.1 million related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. As this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021, we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.\n\nAsset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.\n\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit's goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate.

The total goodwill balance was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2021. A substantial portion of the Company's goodwill relates to the acquisitions of KAYAK in 2013, OpenTable in 2014 and Getaroom in 2021. As it related to the annual impairment test, the Company estimated the fair values using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approaches (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") multiples of comparable publicly traded companies). With respect to the income approach, management makes significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future performance, including revenues, operating margins and discount rates.\n\nGiven the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to selection of the discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating margins required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenues and operating margins and the selection of the discount rates for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the forecasts and the selection of the discount rates.\n- We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results in previous years to management's historical forecasts.\n- We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasts of future revenues and operating margins by comparing management's forecasts with:\n- -Historical revenues and operating margins.\n- -Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\n- -Forecasted information, inclusive of COVID-19 economic assumptions, within analyst, economist and industry reports of the Company and selected companies in its peer group.\n- We considered the impact of industry and market conditions on management's forecasts.\n- With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the discount rates, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n- We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasts of future cash flows and discount rates utilized in the income approach fair value calculation by comparing the income approach fair value to the market approach fair values.\n\n## Commitments and Contingencies - Tax Matters - Refer to Note 16 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. The Company has received income tax and indirect tax assessments relating to permanent establishment, transfer pricing matters, and/or value added taxes, including interest and penalties from French, Italian, and Turkish tax authorities in the amount of $616 million, $286 million, and $61 million respectively. In addition, the Company received an Italian Tax Audit Report which does not constitute a formal tax assessment; however, it recommends a VAT assessment of $175 million, plus interest and penalties. The Company believes that it has been, and continues to be, in compliance with the relevant tax laws, and the Company is contesting these assessments. The Company has recorded a liability of $57 million for France and a liability of $20 million for Italy in",

T he focus of this investm ent continues to be inspiring youth to be active through play and sport as well as uniting and inspiring com m unities to create a better and m ore equitable future for all. O ur com m unity investm ents are an im portant part of our culture, and we support em ployees in giving back to com m unity organizations through volunteering and donations, which are m atched by the N IKE  F oundation where eligible.\n\n## EMPLOYEE BASE\n\nAs of M ay 31, 2024, we had approxim ately 79,400 em ployees worldwide, including retail and part-tim e em ployees. W e also utilize independent contractors and tem porary personnel to supplem ent our workforce.\n\nMost of our em ployees are not represented by unions, except for certain em ployees in the E M E A and AP LA geographies who are m em bers of and/or represented by trade unions, as allowed or required by local law and/or collective bargaining agreem ents. Also, in som e countries outside of the U nited States, local laws require em ployee representation by works councils (which m ay be entitled to inform ation and consultation on certain subsidiary decisions) or by organizations sim ilar to a union. In certain E uropean countries, we are required by local law to enter into, and/or com ply with, industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreem ents. N IKE  has never experienced a m aterial interruption of operations due to labor disagreem ents.\n\n## DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (\"D E &amp;I\") is a strategic priority for N I KE  and we are com m itted to having an inclusive and diverse team  and culture. W e aim  to foster an inclusive and accessible workplace through recruitm ent, developm ent and retention of talent from  diverse experiences and backgrounds with the goal of expanding representation across all dim ensions of diversity over the long term . W e rem ain com m itted to the targets announced in fiscal 2021 for the C om pany to work toward by fiscal 2025, including diverse representation in our corporate workforce and leadership positions.\n\nWe continue our efforts to recruit talent through our traditional channels and through initiatives, such as partnerships with athletes and sports-related organizations to create apprenticeship program s and new partnerships with organizations, colleges and universities that serve diverse populations. Additionally, we are prioritizing D E &amp;I education so that all NIKE  em ployees and leaders have the cultural knowledge and understanding to lead inclusively and build diverse and inclusive team s.

      "answer": "General Motors expects EBIT-adjusted between $13.7 billion and $15.7 billion for the year ending December 31, 2025, but faces regulatory challenges including evolving trade policy and political uncertainty, which could affect profitability. Nike specifically notes that changes in U.S. or foreign trade policies, including tariffs and retaliatory measures, could materially affect its business and financial performance. If retaliatory tariffs are imposed on U.S. goods, both companies could face reduced demand, increased costs, and lower profitability, especially since Nike operates globally and GM cites trade regulations as a key risk factor.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from GM's 2024 10-K that they expect EBIT-adjusted between $13.7 billion and $15.7 billion for 2025 but note that evolving trade policy and political uncertainty are among key risk factors.",

We remain focused on maintaining an efficient cost structure and pricing discipline. We are monitoring  industry  pricing  pressures,  changing  interest  rates,  inflation,  warranty  claims,  consumer  demand  trends  and  potential  changes  in  the  regulatory environment. We continue to prioritize driving down costs and building scale in our EV portfolio to improve profitability.\n\nAs we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results. Refer to the \"Consolidated Results\" and regional sections of this MD&amp;A for additional information.\n\nWe face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges.\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2025, we expect earnings per share (EPS)-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $11.00 and $12.00, Net income attributable to stockholders of between $11.2 billion and $12.5 billion and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted of between $13.7 billion and $15.7 billion.

O ur distribution facilities have in the past and could in the future be interrupted by inform ation technology problem s, disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or governm ent actions taken to m itigate their spread. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. W e maintain business interruption insurance, but it m ay not adequately protect us from  adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\n\nWe are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs a m ultinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and m ust com ply with extensive laws and regulations in the U nited States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels.

Furtherm ore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict am ong jurisdictions and com pliance in one jurisdiction m ay result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction.

U .S. presidential adm inistrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or term ination of trade agreem ents, the im position of higher tariffs on im ports into the U .S., econom ic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other governm ent regulations affecting trade between the U .S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It m ay be tim e-consum ing and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or com ply with any such changes.\n\nChanges or proposed changes in U .S. or other countries' trade policies m ay result in restrictions and econom ic disincentives on international trade.

We believe that any judgment against us involving our products for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable, excess liability insurance coverage.\n\nWe are also subject to breach of warranty claims resulting from state and federal consumer protection laws which allow consumers to hold manufacturers legally responsible  for  \"breaches\"  of  implied  or  ex press  warranties.  Claims  can  include  but  are  not  limited  to  a  refund,  a  replacement  vehicle,  a  recovery  of  legal  and administrative fees or other monetary damages. Losses that we believe to be probable and estimable based on evaluation of historical transactions are included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and are reviewed regularly for adequacy. We believe that any judgment against us involving our warranties for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals.\n\nGuarantees We enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain joint ventures.  These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2025 to 2029, or upon the occurrence of specific events or are ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered by our recorded accruals, which are insignificant. The maximum future undiscounted payments mainly based on royalties received associated with vehicles sold to date were $3.7 billion and $3.5 billion for these guarantees at  December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of which relates to the indemnification agreements.\n\nWe provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. In some instances, certain assets of the party or our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the amount of any potential future payments. We are also exposed to residual value guarantees associated with certain sales to rental car companies.\n\nWe periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not possible to estimate our maximum exposure  under  these  indemnifications  or  guarantees  due  to  the  conditional  nature  of  these  obligations.  Insignificant  amounts  have  been  recorded  for  such obligations  as  the  majority  of  them  are  not  probable  or  estimable  at  this  time  and  the  fair  value  of  the  guarantees  at  issuance  was  insignificant.  Refer  to  the Opel/Vauxhall Sale section of this note for additional information on our indemnification obligations to Stellantis under the Agreement.\n\nCredit  Cards Credit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our redemption liability was insignificant, our deferred revenue was $425 million and $384 million, and qualified cardholders had rebates available, net of deferred program revenue, of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Our redemption liability and deferred revenue are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities.\n\nSupplier  Finance  Programs Third-party finance providers offer certain suppliers the option for payment in advance of their invoice due date through financing programs that we established. We retain our obligation to the participating suppliers, and we make payments directly to the third-party finance providers on the original  invoice  due  date  pursuant  to  the  original  invoice  terms.  There  are  no  assets  pledged  as  security  or  other  forms  of  guarantees  provided  for  committed payments.

Similarly, SBUX experienced a direct labor cost increase due to the July 1, 2024, federal minimum salary threshold increase under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Additionally, SBUX is undergoing collective bargaining with union-represented stores, which could lead to further cost increases and operational constraints.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. Our business is subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state, and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic, or social events. Changes in, ex panded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage requirements, collective bargaining, the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees, the distinction between employees and contractors, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, health care, data privacy and cybersecurity, the sale and pricing of some of our products, transportation, logistics, international trade, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, taxes, unclaimed property, sustainability, the environment and climate change, including energy costs and consumption, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputational and legal risks, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements, negatively affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe are, and in the future will become, involved in lawsuits, including consumer, commercial, employment, tort and other litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Some of these proceedings raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. Furthermore, defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management's attention and resources. None of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved, individually or collectively, are considered material.\n\nThe inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, and our sales.\n\nPrices of certain commodity products, including lumber, copper, energy, and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices, such as changes in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy, have affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for our products and our sales.\n\nTax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\n\nWe may be affected by higher rates of federal, state, or local tax  imposed as a result of political developments or economic conditions, which could affect our effective tax rate. Our effective tax  rate and future tax  liability could be adversely affected by regulatory and legal changes, the results of tax  audits and ex aminations, disallowed tax strategies, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax  matters, all of which could negatively impact our business. Changes in tax  laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally could also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLiquidity and access to capital rely on efficient, rational, and open capital markets and are dependent on our credit strength. Our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business, financial performance, and results of operations.\n\nWe rely on cash flows from operations, as well as continued access to capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis, as needed, to fund our operations, make strategic investments to support long-term growth, return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and repay debt maturities as they become due. Our access to capital markets depends on our strong credit ratings, the overall condition of such capital markets and our operating performance. If rating agencies lower or place our credit ratings on a credit watch, or if we ex perience a deterioration of certain financial ratios, it could adversely affect our ability to access the public debt markets and our cost of funds. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and there is no guarantee that our current credit ratings will remain the same. Disruption in the financial markets, including as a result of rising interest rates, bank failures or other macroeconomic conditions, or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs.\n\n## Item 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.",

These factors and others have also made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a dispersed workforce, and to train partners to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers, who are necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in the availability and cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally. Such increases could be triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling, and benefits; increases in healthcare and workers' compensation insurance costs; and increases in wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. For ex ample, at the federal level, effective July 1, 2024, the United States Department of Labor increased the minimum salary threshold requirements for employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime requirements, and at the state level, Assembly Bill 1228 increased minimum wage and established working hour and working condition standards for certain partners in California. These changes, along with others that may occur in the future, could have a significant impact on the classification of employees as being exempt from overtime and add to our labor costs. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise, and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience; the failure to do so could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for other key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nStarting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. Unions have secured representation rights at hundreds of our more than 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores, with potentially more to follow, and Starbucks is engaged in collective bargaining for initial collective bargaining agreements for these stores. If we encounter difficulties negotiating collective bargaining agreements, are unsuccessful in those efforts, or obtain contracts with unfavorable terms, then we could incur additional costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. These risks could also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nThe law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because, in certain circumstances, the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment. Moreover, where a petition for representation has been filed by a union, the employer is also constrained from making changes in wages, hours, and working conditions. These limitations could also negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nMoreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales and customer flow in impacted locations, our costs, and can also have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nAdditionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and could have material adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm.\n\n## Risks Related to Competition\n\n## We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\n\nThe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience (such as delivery service and mobile ordering), and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks stores and/or average value per transaction, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or \u00ae",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThere are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services we offer.  Key indicators we monitor include home price appreciation, age of the housing stock, real disposable personal income, and housing turnover.  We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth over time as the US population moves through major life stages and events. These include strong millennial household formation, an increased preference among older generations to age in place, and the persistence of remote work.\n\n## Our Competition\n\nThe home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape that continues to evolve.  We compete with national and regional home improvement warehouse chains and lumber yards in most of the markets we serve.  We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical, and home supply retailers, as well as paint stores, lumber yards, garden centers, and maintenance and repair organizations.  In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, home goods specialty stores, warehouse clubs, online retailers, other specialty retailers, providers of equipment and tool rental, service providers that install home improvement products, and wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, renters, businesses, and the government.\n\nLocation of stores, product assortment, product pricing, and customer service continue to be key competitive factors in our industry, while the evolution of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies, ex pansion of fulfillment capabilities, and customer ex pectations also underscore the importance of omnichannel capabilities as a competitive factor.  See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, 'Risk Factors', of this Annual Report.\n\n## Our Omnichannel Capabilities\n\nWe are committed to meeting customer demand to shop however, whenever, and wherever they choose. Our omnichannel network provides a single view of the customer, no matter where they place their order, whether in-store, online, on-site or through the contact center. This allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, the majority of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, customers may pick up their purchase in-store at the customer service desk, curbside, or from touchless lockers, or have their purchase delivered to their home or business. In addition, flex ible fulfillment options are available for in-store purchases and those made through the contact center. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an extended aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our leverage of our existing infrastructure with the omnichannel capabilities we continue to introduce.\n\n## In-Store\n\nOur 1,748 Lowe's-branded home improvement stores and outlet stores are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space.  Our home improvement stores offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on localization, along with a dedicated team of knowledgeable and friendly frontline associates available to assist our customers.  We continue to develop and implement productivity tools, including our front-end transformation and freight flow optimization initiatives, to enhance the efficiency of our sales associates and improve the customer experience.  Our Lowe's Outlet stores have a smaller format and offer value to our customers through incremental savings on discontinued, overstocked, or scratch and dent items.\n\n## Online\n\nThrough our websites and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, product information, customer ratings and reviews, buying guides, how-to videos, and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up instore, curbside pick-up, same-day delivery through our gig network, and shipment to their homes or businesses. Further, we also offer digital inspiration, design, and project management tools across our destination home improvement categories.\n\n## On-Site\n\nWe have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects.  Our Pro sales managers meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage nearby stores and our distribution network to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources.  In addition, our In-Home Sales program is available in the majority of our stores to discuss various exterior projects such as windows, doors, and fencing, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields as well as agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\n\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote.\n\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional, and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service, and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\n\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and foodservice accounts and also compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\n\n## Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents, and Domain Names\n\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, and Frappuccino, are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\n\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems, and designs, which have an average remaining duration of approximately thirteen years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including 'Starbucks.com,' 'Starbucks.net,' and 'Starbucksreserve.com.'\n\n## Seasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to, and loaded by, customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Starbucks Cards, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations, and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations, and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.",
