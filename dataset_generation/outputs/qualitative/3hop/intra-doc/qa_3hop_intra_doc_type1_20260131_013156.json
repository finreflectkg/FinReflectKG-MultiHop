      "question": "How does GM's strategic emphasis on crossovers as a key product category align with its financial transactions and equity stake in nonconsolidated affiliates involved in crossover production?",
      "answer": "GM highlights crossovers as a core product category within its automotive operations, noting that these vehicles help maintain sales volumes and contribute to fuel efficiency goals. The company also engages in transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates involved in the development, production, and marketing of crossovers, indicating a strategic reliance on these partners. However, since these affiliates are not consolidated, their financial performance does not directly appear in GM\u2019s consolidated results, despite their importance to crossover output. This structure allows GM to leverage external manufacturing capacity without fully absorbing the financial risks associated with direct ownership, aligning with its broader approach to managing costs and scaling production efficiently.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [GM](page_101) \u2192 [Crossovers]: Crossovers are listed among key product categories that help maintain showroom traffic and meet fuel efficiency standards.",
        "Hop 2: [Crossovers] \u2192 [Nonconsolidated Affiliates]: Nonconsolidated affiliates are involved in the development, production, and marketing of crossovers, with GM transacting with them for parts and vehicles.",
        "Hop 3: [Nonconsolidated Affiliates] \u2190 [GM](page_78): GM has equity stakes in these affiliates but does not consolidate their financials, indicating a strategic yet financially distinct relationship."

      "question": "How does the revenue contribution of apparel within Nike's geographic segments compare to the role of Converse in Nike's licensing and revenue diversification strategy?",
      "answer": "Nike's apparel segment generated $13.567 billion in revenue across geographic regions, with North America contributing the largest share at $5.492 billion. This reflects the significance of apparel within Nike's core geographic operations. Meanwhile, Converse, as a reportable segment, contributes to Nike's licensing and diversification strategy, with its 'Other revenues' primarily attributable to licensing businesses. Additionally, Converse is integrated into Nike's broader foreign exchange risk management program, indicating its strategic role in revenue diversification beyond direct geographic operations. The contrast highlights how Nike leverages both geographic market expansion and brand-specific licensing through Converse to drive revenue growth and risk mitigation.",

      "question": "How does Converse's reported revenue growth from licensing activities align with the overall performance of the Apparel category within Nike's geographic operating segments, given Converse's role in designing and selling athletic lifestyle apparel?",
      "answer": "Converse reported a 7% revenue increase on a currency-neutral basis in fiscal 2022, with growth attributed in part to higher licensee revenues. This licensing activity contrasts with its direct operations in the Apparel category, where Converse generated only $103 million in apparel revenue globally, compared to Nike Brand's $13.567 billion in apparel revenue across its geographic segments. Despite Converse's focus on athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, its apparel contribution remains minimal relative to Nike\u2019s broader brand divisions, suggesting that Converse's strategic value lies more in licensing and brand equity than in direct apparel sales performance.",

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2022 due to revenue growth in North America, Western Europe and licensee markets, partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 22%, led by strong digital demand. Wholesale revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China as well as global supply chain constraints. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 6%, while ASP increased 12%, driven by growth in direct to consumer.\n\nReported EBIT increased 23%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense, while operating overhead increased primarily due to higher professional services costs.",

      "answer": "GM reports significant transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates involved in the development, production, and marketing of automobile parts (page 78), indicating a reliance on external entities for critical components. However, in the business segment overview (page 101), GM emphasizes its internal production of 'substantially all' trucks, crossovers, cars, and automobile parts, suggesting a strategic preference for internal control. This creates a tension between operational dependency on external partners and the stated strategic objective of maintaining internal manufacturing capabilities. The financial exposure to nonconsolidated affiliates for parts production raises questions about the extent of GM\u2019s actual control and the potential risks to its strategic execution if these affiliates underperform or terminate partnerships.",

      "question": "How does the impairment of goodwill related to OpenTable in 2020 reconcile with the continued emphasis on restaurant reservations as a key business metric in 2021, despite the lack of contribution to gross bookings?",
      "answer": "In 2020, OpenTable experienced significant goodwill impairment totaling $1.062 billion due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely reduced near-term cash flows and delayed recovery expectations for restaurant reservation monetization. Despite this, in 2021, Booking Holdings continued to highlight restaurant reservations through OpenTable as a key operating metric, even though it did not contribute to gross bookings. This suggests that while the financial valuation of the OpenTable acquisition suffered due to reduced monetization potential, the company still viewed restaurant reservations as a strategic component of its broader ecosystem, potentially for driving user engagement and cross-platform activity.",

          "chunk_text": "A substantial portion of our intangible assets and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable, KAYAK, and Getaroom. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.\n\nWe review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment indicators were identified for our long-lived assets.\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches).\n\n## 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations.

In 2021, Booking.com expanded its flight offering into 34 markets, aligning with the company's vision to integrate travel elements such as flights, accommodations, and ground transportation. This expansion is directly tied to the increase in merchant transaction costs of $215 million, primarily driven by the growth in merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com. The increase in costs reflects the rising transaction volume and operational scale associated with BKNG's strategic push to enhance its service offerings and provide a more comprehensive travel experience.

          "chunk_text": "## Our Strategy\n\nWe aim to demonstrate global leadership in online travel and restaurant reservation and related services by:\n\n- providing consumers with the most comprehensive choices and prices at any time, in any place, on any device;\n- making it easy for people to find, book, pay for, and experience their travel desires;\n- offering platforms, tools, and insights to our business partners to help them be successful; and\n- operating our business sustainably and supporting sustainable travel choices by our consumers and partners.\n\nWe focus on relentless innovation and execution and a commitment to serve both consumers and partners with unmatched service and best-in-class technology. Although new variants of COVID-19 continue to make the shape and timing of recovery uncertain, we believe the global online travel and dining industries will gradually return to pre-pandemic levels and consumer purchasing will continue to shift from traditional offline to online channels. As travel demand returns, we expect to benefit from this online growth by expanding our service offerings and markets. In particular, we seek to (a) leverage technology to provide consumers with the best experience, (b) partner with travel service providers and restaurants to our mutual benefit, (c) operate multiple brands that collaborate with each other, and (d) invest in profitable and sustainable growth.\n\n- Provide the best consumer experience. Offering consumers an outstanding online experience is essential to our success. We focus on providing consumers with: (a) intuitive, easy-to-use online travel and restaurant reservation and search services; (b) a comprehensive selection of accommodations, other travel offerings, restaurants and payment options; (c) informative and useful content, such as pictures, accommodation and restaurant details, reviews, and sustainability information; and (d) excellent customer service. Our goal is to make travel easy, frictionless, and personal and to offer consumers the most value, the most trusted brands, the most personalized experience, and the most extensive, varied, and comprehensive travel service selection in every geography. We believe that our continued work to build out our payments capabilities across the Company helps to remove some of the friction in the booking process and enables us to offer additional value for travelers. Further, we endeavor to provide excellent customer service in a variety of ways, including through call centers and online platforms and the use of chatbots and other technologies, so that consumers can be confident that booking reservations through us will be a positive experience.\n\nAlthough the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted in 2021, we continue to innovate and invest in our services in order to emerge from the pandemic in a strong position to meet the needs of consumers and partners. We seek to grow our business through innovation by providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms (i.e., websites and mobile apps) and building stronger relationships with our customers and partners. As a result, we continue to execute against our long-term strategy to build a seamless offering of multiple elements of travel, which we refer to as the \"Connected Trip.\" We believe that through innovation and the utilization of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Connected Trip will simplify and improve all aspects of the travel experience, including discovery, planning, booking, paying, coordinating itineraries among travel service providers, and automatic rescheduling. For example, if a traveler's flight is delayed, we envision that ultimately the Connected Trip will not only alert the traveler, but also automatically arrange for a late arrival at the hotel, change a dinner reservation and alert companion diners, reschedule the car arranged for airport transfer, find a later connecting flight, offer one-click rebooking and payment for any other changes, and manage other impacts from the delayed flight. We believe offering travelers a compelling flight product alongside our other travel products is a key component of our Connected Trip vision. In 2021, we made progress in building out a flight offering at Booking.com, including expanding into 34 countries by the end of the year. We expect that these developments will benefit our travelers, travel service providers, and restaurant partners, as well as provide a compelling and differentiated service offering that will drive enhanced loyalty and frequency over time.\n\n- Partner with travel service providers and restaurants. We aim to establish mutually beneficial relationships with travel service providers and restaurants around the world. We believe that travel service providers and restaurants benefit from participating in our services by increasing their distribution channels, demand, profile and reputation, and inventory utilization in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Travel service providers and restaurants benefit from our trusted brands and marketing efforts, expertise in offering an excellent consumer experience, and ability to offer their inventory in markets and to consumers that they may otherwise be unable or unlikely to reach, for instance due to language or payments services we are able to offer on their behalf.\n- Operate multiple brands. We operate multiple brands, which allows us to offer our services in ways that appeal to different consumers, pursue distinct marketing and business strategies, encourage experimentation and",

      "question": "How does the regulatory risk associated with Booking.com's commission structure in Switzerland impact the financial performance of BKNG's accommodation reservation services, given the dominance of this service in the company's revenue mix?",
      "answer": "The ongoing Swiss Price Surveillance Office investigation into Booking.com's commission structure introduces regulatory uncertainty that could force Booking.com to reduce its commissions in Switzerland, directly affecting BKNG's primary revenue source\u2014accommodation reservations, which accounted for 87% of total revenue in 2021. If Booking.com is required to lower its commission rates due to an adverse ruling, this would compress BKNG's margins on accommodation bookings in that market. Given that accommodation reservations represent the vast majority of BKNG\u2019s revenue, any regulatory-driven margin pressure on this service line could materially affect overall profitability and growth, especially if similar regulatory actions follow in other jurisdictions.",

To the extent that these or any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nAs markets evolve and NCAs or other governmental authorities continue to monitor our industry, new investigations of the industry generally or of us specifically could and have occurred, including revisiting issues that were the subject of prior investigations. While we believe that we are complying with our commitments, investigating authorities or third parties may determine that we are not complying with the commitments we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedies. Further, in September 2017 the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland and the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland. We are cooperating with regulators where applicable, but we are unable to predict what, if any, effect any investigations or resolutions thereof, including the effect of any commitments we might make, will have on our business, industry practices, or online commerce more generally.\n\nTo the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on us or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding competition and/or consumer law investigations could adversely affect our brands and therefore our business, market share, and results of operations. Competition and consumer law-related investigations, legislation, or issues have and could in the future result in private litigation.\n\nAnother area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restrictions where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search terms related to the other party (e.g., such other party's name). Although we are generally moving away from these types of agreements, in some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to bidding restrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contracts, it could negatively impact our performance marketing efficiency, business, and results of operations.\n\nThere is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger. In some instances, countries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities than actions taken by NCAs or other regulatory authorities. France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety and, last year, a German court ruled that our narrow parity clauses are not permitted. Additionally, the EU's Platform to Business Regulation regulates the relationship between online platforms such as Booking.com and European business users of online platforms. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be \"gatekeepers.\" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not entirely known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to presume that we are a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act as currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption, we would be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For example, the rules applicable to gatekeepers could impose limitations on data collection and usage across services or with third parties, as well as on bundling services, and could require gatekeepers to share certain customer information with partners. Wide and possibly any type of parity clauses could be prohibited for gatekeeper platforms. Additionally, in July 2021 President Biden of the United States signed an executive order aimed at restricting anticompetitive practices, including those within the technology industry. Any rules or regulations that result from this executive order, as well as any other new laws and regulations and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our services, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise cause us to incur additional operating costs to comply with or address these developments. Further, as market conditions change as a result of investigations, litigation, legislation, or political or social pressure, we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practices beyond what is required, the full effects of which may not be known when making the decision, but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWith additional attention on the size of travel or technology companies generally, our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, our ability to expand into complementary businesses or our latitude in dealing with travel service providers (such as by limiting our ability to provide discounts, rebates, or incentives or to exercise contractual rights), any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or ability to grow and compete.",

At the same time, we continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands in our efforts to provide consumers with the most comprehensive and value-oriented services. We invest resources to support organic growth by all our brands, whether through increased marketing, geographic expansion, technological innovation, or increased access to accommodations, flights, rental cars, restaurants, or other services.\n\n- Invest in profitable and sustainable growth. We seek to offer online services that meet the needs and the expectations of consumers, travel service providers, and restaurants and that we believe will result in mutual longterm profitability and growth. We intend to accomplish this through continuous investment and innovation, growing our businesses in new and current markets, expanding our services, and ensuring that we provide an appealing, intuitive, and easy-to-use consumer experience. We have made significant investments in people, technology, marketing, and expanded, new, or additional services, such as improving the selection of our extensive collection of accommodations including homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay, expanded flight and ground transportation offerings, payments, and other offerings. In 2021, we continued to scale our flight offerings to more markets, and offer payments solutions to more customers and partners. We continue to seek to maximize the benefits of our scale by sharing resources and technological innovations among our brands and co-developing new services. We also regularly evaluate, and may pursue and consummate, potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, or investments, whether to expand our businesses into complementary areas, expand our current businesses, acquire innovative technology, or for other reasons. For instance, in December 2021, we completed the acquisition of Getaroom, a business-to-business distributor of hotel rooms, which in conjunction with our Priceline business we expect to increase value for both hotel and affiliate partners, and in November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group.\n\n## Service Offerings\n\nBooking.com and Rentalcars.com. Booking.com is the world's leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations, based on room nights booked, with operations worldwide and headquarters in the Netherlands. At December 31, 2021, Booking.com offered accommodation reservation services for approximately 2.4 million properties in over 220 countries and territories and in over 40 languages, consisting of over 400,000 hotels, motels, and resorts and over 1.9 million homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay.\n\nIn 2021, Booking.com significantly expanded its flight offering to 34 markets and in-destination tours and activities to more than 840 cities around the world.

This update is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 21 for additional information on government assistance.\n\n## 3 . REVENUE\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenue\n\n## Revenue by Type of Service\n\nApproximately 87%, 88%, and 87% of the Company's revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, relates to online accommodation reservation services. Revenue from all other sources of online travel reservation services and advertising and other revenues each individually represent less than 10% of the Company's total revenues for each year.\n\n## Revenue by Geographic Area\n\nSee Note 18 for the information related to revenue by geographic area.\n\n## Deferred Merchant Bookings and Deferred Revenue\n\nCash payments received from travelers in advance of the Company completing its performance obligations are included in \"Deferred merchant bookings\" in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are comprised principally of amounts estimated to be payable to the travel service providers as well as the Company's estimated deferred revenue for its commission or margin and fees. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred merchant bookings included deferred revenue for online travel reservation services of $148 million and $50 million, respectively. The amounts are subject to refunds for cancellations. The Company expects to complete its performance obligations generally within one year from the reservation date. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenues of $35 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2021 is principally driven by payments received from travelers, net of amounts estimated to be payable to travel service providers, for online travel reservations in the current period.\n\n## Loyalty and Other Incentive Programs\n\nThe Company provides loyalty programs, such as OpenTable's loyalty program, where participating consumers are awarded loyalty points on current transactions that can be redeemed in the future. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, liabilities for loyalty program incentives of $13 million and $21 million, respectively, were included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of the loyalty points that are expected to be redeemed is recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the incentives are granted. In 2020, the Company recorded a decrease of $28 million to the liability, primarily due to changes in estimates of the number of loyalty points expected to be redeemed prior to expiration under OpenTable's loyalty program, with a corresponding increase to revenue.\n\nIn addition to the loyalty programs, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, liabilities of $58 million and $60 million, respectively, for other incentive programs, such as referral bonuses, rebates, credits, and discounts, including for Booking.com's back-to-travel campaigns, were included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2020, the Company offered additional rebates to customers meeting certain eligibility requirements under an incentive program at Booking.com. The eligibility requirements include the customer's enrollment in Booking.com's Genius Program (program features include special discounts offered by customers to frequent travelers) and Preferred Partner Program (program features include greater visibility for customers in search results for payment of higher commission) and timely payment of invoices. The additional rebates resulted in a reduction of revenue of $100 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and a liability of $25 million at December 31, 2020.",

However, the company explicitly states that KAYAK's search queries do not contribute to gross bookings, which is the primary metric used to assess the volume of travel services booked through OTC brands. This suggests a misalignment between the asset valuation, which emphasizes KAYAK's strategic importance, and the operational performance measurement, which does not factor in KAYAK's user engagement through search queries.

      "answer": "The Cruise Class G Preferred Shares issued in 2021 carry a four-year transfer restriction, expiring in 2025, while the earlier issued Cruise Class F Preferred Shares had a transfer restriction that expired in May 2023. This staggered restriction timeline allows GM to maintain strategic influence over Cruise Holdings for a longer period through the Class G shares, particularly during critical phases of development and potential IPO planning. Additionally, the Class G shares grant voting rights on all matters submitted for vote, whereas Class F shares are limited to voting on the election of one director.

      "answer": "NTC, which operates with the U.S. Dollar as its functional currency, sells products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign exchange exposure for the NTC. A stronger U.S. Dollar increases NIKE's product cost, while a weaker Dollar reduces it. This exposure is partially offset by NIKE\u2019s foreign currency adjustment program with factories, which affects inventory cost recognition. As of May 31, 2022, NIKE reported $59 million of Inventories in held-for-sale entities, indicating that inventory cost fluctuations from foreign exchange could directly affect the valuation and profitability of these acquired/divested assets.

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period, hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. Additionally, the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company.\n\nThe purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs, non-functional currency denominated revenues, intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.\n\nProduct cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different",

The impact of acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, was not considered material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, as a result of the Company's decision to transition its wholesale and direct to consumer operating model in certain countries within its APLA operating segment to third-party distributors, the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as held-for-sale within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into separate definitive agreements to sell its entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as its entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of these entities will remain classified as held-forsale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, held-for-sale assets were $182 million, primarily consisting of $73 million of Accounts receivable, net and $59 million of Inventories; held-for-sale liabilities were $58 million, primarily consisting of $26 million of Accrued liabilities and $20 million of Accounts payable.\n\nAs of May 31, 2021, held-for-sale assets were $175 million, primarily consisting of $76 million of Inventories and $59 million of Accounts receivable, net; held-for-sale liabilities were $72 million, primarily consisting of $25 million of Accounts payable and $22 million of Accrued liabilities.",

KAYAK, which is owned by BKNG, is a meta-search platform offering price comparisons across hundreds of travel platforms, operating in over 60 countries. Despite this strategic alignment, BKNG recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge for KAYAK in 2020, indicating a disconnect between KAYAK\u2019s expected strategic value and its financial performance.

      "answer": "HD accrues dividend equivalents on performance shares and restricted stock units as reinvested shares, which are paid out upon vesting or award payout. For performance shares, this is tied to a three-year performance cycle based on ROIC and operating profit, while for restricted stock units, it occurs upon vesting, which can be up to five years after the grant date. In contrast, dividend equivalents on deferred shares granted to non-employee directors accrue and are paid out in the form of additional shares upon termination of Board service. This reveals a strategic distinction in HD's stock-based compensation: performance-based and time-vesting equity awards for associates emphasize long-term alignment with company performance and retention, while deferred shares for non-employee directors focus on service duration and post-service value retention. The immediate expensing of deferred shares also contrasts with the multi-year expense recognition for performance shares and restricted stock units, highlighting a differentiated approach to stakeholder compensation.",

      "answer": "The issuance of 2,894,424 shares to the 2019 Warrantholders in October 2024 directly contributed to the dilutive effect of warrants in the computation of diluted net income per share. This aligns with the 8 million weighted average shares attributable to Warrants for the year ended December 31, 2024, as disclosed in the earnings per share table. While the warrant exercises increased the actual share count, the diluted EPS calculation incorporates the time-weighted average dilution effect of these warrants throughout the year, suggesting that the October issuance was a significant contributor to the final dilutive impact.",

      "answer": "BKNG excludes KAYAK's search queries from its gross bookings metric because KAYAK operates under a different business model than BKNG's OTC brands. Gross bookings, a key financial performance metric, reflect the dollar value of travel services booked through OTC brands, while KAYAK's search queries are a separate operating metric. Despite KAYAK's strategic role in driving traffic and discovery, its financial contribution is not directly captured in gross bookings, which could obscure its influence on overall performance. This becomes even more significant considering that BKNG recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge related to KAYAK in 2020, indicating a substantial decline in the expected future economic benefits from the acquisition. The lack of direct financial linkage between KAYAK's search volume and BKNG's reported gross bookings raises questions about how KAYAK's value is assessed and how its underperformance, as evidenced by the impairment, aligns with its operational role in the broader ecosystem.",

      "answer": "The decline in Converse's revenue by 15% in fiscal 2023, driven by drops in North America and Western Europe, contrasts with the broader Nike Brand's apparel revenue, which contributed $13.843 billion across geographic segments. While Converse's apparel segment only generated $90 million in revenue, reflecting its relatively minor role in the broader apparel category, Nike's own apparel revenues remained strong in key markets like North America ($5.947 billion) and Europe, Middle East & Africa ($4.566 billion). This indicates that while Nike's core apparel business remains robust across global markets, Converse's apparel performance lagged significantly, contributing minimally to the overall apparel revenue and reflecting a more challenging position in the lifestyle apparel segment.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of additional shares delivered under accelerated share repurchase agreements relate to the accrual of dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units, given that both impact share count and shareholder value in different ways?",
      "answer": "The additional shares delivered under accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR) represent a final settlement of share repurchases based on the volume-weighted average price over the agreement term, which directly reduces the weighted average share count for earnings per share calculations. These ASR-related additional shares are part of a structured equity transaction with financial institutions. Separately, dividend equivalents accrue on unvested restricted stock units and are paid out as additional shares upon vesting, which increases the total shares outstanding upon payout. While both involve additional shares, the ASR mechanism is a strategic capital allocation tool to return value to shareholders through buy-ins, whereas dividend equivalents on restricted stock units are a compensation-related feature that increases share issuance as part of employee incentive programs. This dual impact on share count and shareholder value must be considered when modeling dilution and capital structure changes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HD(page_66) \u2192 Additional Shares: HD uses ASR agreements with financial institutions, where the final number of shares delivered depends on the volume-weighted average price over the agreement term, with additional shares issued upon settlement.",
        "Hop 2: Additional Shares \u2192 Dividend Equivalents: Additional shares from ASR agreements are equity-settled, similar to dividend equivalents, which also result in additional shares being issued upon vesting or payout of equity awards.",
        "Hop 3: Dividend Equivalents \u2190 HD(page_69): Dividend equivalents accrue on unvested restricted stock units and are paid out in the form of additional shares upon vesting, directly impacting share count and shareholder dilution."

      "answer": "NIKE manages its foreign currency risk through a $18.5 billion portfolio of outstanding foreign currency derivatives, which includes both designated cash flow hedges and embedded derivative contracts. A key component of this risk management strategy is the foreign currency adjustment program with third-party factories, under which NIKE assumes certain factory currency exposures that naturally offset its own. This program creates embedded derivative contracts for currencies outside the U.S. Dollar and the factory\u2019s local currency. The NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub, purchases products from these factories in U.S. Dollars and then sells them to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. This creates a foreign currency exposure for the NTC when selling to NIKE entities with different functional currencies. The interplay between the derivatives, embedded contracts, and NTC\u2019s role in the supply chain illustrates how NIKE structures its financial risk management to mitigate exposure across its global operations.",

These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThe Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.\n\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $18.5 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, approximately $607 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2022, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $3 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\n\nAs part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $584 million.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 82",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

      "question": "How does the issuance of Cruise Class G Preferred Shares to Microsoft and Walmart in 2021 relate to the earlier issuance of Cruise Class F Preferred Shares in 2019, particularly in terms of capital structure alignment and strategic intent for Cruise Holdings?",
      "answer": "The issuance of Cruise Class G Preferred Shares in 2021 to Microsoft, Walmart, and others, including General Motors Holdings LLC with a $1.0 billion investment, builds upon the capital structure established by the 2019 issuance of Cruise Class F Preferred Shares, which included a $687 million investment from General Motors Holdings LLC. Both classes of preferred shares are structured to convert into common stock upon an IPO and provide holders with liquidation preferences and pari passu dividend rights alongside common shareholders. However, the Class G issuance expanded strategic alignment by including external partners like Microsoft, with whom GM entered a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. This indicates that while the Class F shares were foundational in funding Cruise\u2019s operations, the Class G issuance was more explicitly tied to strategic partnerships and broader corporate objectives, reflecting a shift from internal capital infusion to external strategic collaboration.",

However, the company faces risks related to the timely and profitable introduction of new vehicle models, particularly EVs, which are central to its long-term profitability. At the same time, GM relies on nonconsolidated affiliates for the development, production, and marketing of trucks and other vehicles. These affiliates are integral to GM's production ecosystem, as evidenced by the volume of transactions and interdependencies in purchasing and selling component parts and vehicles. This reliance introduces potential constraints in quality control, cost management, and innovation alignment, all of which are critical to the successful execution of GM\u2019s EV strategy.

Risk Factors\n\nWe  have  listed  below  the  most  material  risk  factors  applicable  to  us.  These  risk  factors  are  not  necessarily  in  the  order  of importance or probability of occurrence:\n\n## Risks related to our competition and strategy\n\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will  continue  to  experience  significant  change  in  the  coming  years,  particularly  as  traditional  automotive  original  equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the  entrance  of  start-ups  and  other  non-traditional  competitors  in  the  automotive  industry.  These  new  competitors,  as  well  as established  industry  participants,  are  disrupting  the  historic  business  model  of  our  industry  through  the  introduction  of  new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer  sales channels, methods  of  transportation  and  vehicle  ownership.  To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that  are  outside  of  our  historically  core  ICE  business,  such  as  EVs  and A Vs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.\n\nOur vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any constraints  on  lending  due  to  concerns  about  climate  change,  our  ability  to  execute  on  our  strategic  plans  could  be  adversely affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\n\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\n\nOur ability  to  maintain  profitability  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  timely  fund  and  introduce  new  and  improved  vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with market  participants  routinely  introducing  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  and  features  designed  to  meet  rapidly  evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility  to  adjust  personnel  costs  to  changes  in  demands  for  our  products,  may  further  exacerbate  the  risks  associated  with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\n\nOur  long-term  strategy  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  profitably  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  EVs. The  production  and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future.  In  2021,  we  increased  our  commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV strategy  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  high-quality  EVs  that  are  competitive  and  meet  consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.",

      "question": "How does the foreign currency exposure arising from NKE's transactions through the NTC compare with the exposure from direct purchases by NKE entities from third-party factories, particularly in light of the embedded derivative contracts tied to the factory currency exposure index?",
      "answer": "The NTC, as a wholly-owned sourcing hub, purchases NIKE-branded products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and sells them to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure for the NTC when it sells to entities with different functional currencies. In contrast, when NKE entities purchase directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars, the foreign currency exposure falls on those NKE entities if their functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, the foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories introduces embedded derivative contracts for currencies within the factory currency exposure index that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. As of May 31, 2022, the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $584 million, which includes these contracts. This highlights a layered exposure structure where NKE manages risk both through internal sourcing (NTC) and direct factory relationships, with different accounting treatments and hedging strategies applied depending on the transaction structure and currency involved.",

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThe Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.\n\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $18.5 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, approximately $607 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2022, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $3 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\n\nAs part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $584 million.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 82",

      "answer": "BKNG's effective tax rate in 2023 was positively impacted by the Innovation Box Tax (IBT), which taxed qualifying income at 9% instead of the standard 25.8% Dutch corporate tax rate. However, the IBT benefit decreased compared to prior years, contributing less favorably to the effective tax rate in 2023 than in 2022. This was partially offset by a lower valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to international operations, which also contributed to a lower effective tax rate. The combination of a reduced IBT benefit and lower valuation allowance reflects a net decrease in tax benefits, yet the IBT still had a significant positive impact on BKNG's overall tax position.",

      "answer": "BKNG's effective tax rate in 2023 was lower than in 2022, partly due to a lower valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to international operations ($30 million in 2023 vs. $29 million in 2022), despite a decrease in the benefit from the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax. Under Dutch Corporate Income Tax Law, the Innovation Box Tax rate remained at 9% in 2023 (vs. the statutory rate of 25.8%), which continued to provide a beneficial impact on the effective tax rate. However, the benefit from this tax regime decreased compared to 2022, when the rate was also 9% but the valuation allowance was slightly lower. The overall effect of these changes was a net reduction in the effective tax rate for 2023, despite the reduced Innovation Box Tax benefit.",

      "answer": "The NIKE Brand generated $13,843 million in apparel revenue in fiscal 2023, while Converse contributed only $90 million in apparel revenue, indicating that Converse's business is heavily skewed toward footwear ($2,155 million) rather than apparel. Despite this footwear focus, Converse reported a 15% revenue decline and a 30% EBIT drop, driven by weakness in North America and Western Europe, and margin pressures from foreign exchange and promotional pricing. This contrasts with the broader NIKE Brand, which maintained strong apparel revenue performance across multiple geographies, suggesting that Converse's apparel offerings are not only a minor contributor but also face disproportionate challenges in execution and profitability.",

      "answer": "GM positions crossovers as a core product line critical for meeting required fuel efficiency standards, reflecting their strategic importance in regulatory compliance and market demand (page 99). Simultaneously, GM relies on nonconsolidated affiliates for various aspects of development, production, and marketing of crossovers, indicating a shared manufacturing and innovation model (page 75). The company also engages in purchase and sale transactions with these affiliates, which suggests a coordinated but financially distinct partnership structure. This alignment shows that GM leverages external partnerships to produce a vehicle category central to its regulatory and strategic goals, balancing control with operational flexibility.",

As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  the  trucks,  crossovers,  cars  and  automobile  parts  produced  are  marketed  through  retail  dealers  in  North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In  addition  to  the  products  sold  to  dealers  for  consumer  retail  sales,  trucks,  crossovers  and  cars  are  also  sold  to  fleet  customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale  vehicle  services  and  products  through  the  dealer  network,  such  as  maintenance,  light  repairs,  collision  repairs,  vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have  equity  ownership  stakes  in  entities  that  meet  the  demands  of  customers  in  other  countries,  primarily  China,  with  vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology, and includes AV-related engineering and other costs. We provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/Vauxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment specific revenues and expenses are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily  consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  marketable  debt  securities,  Stellantis  warrants  and  intersegment  balances.  All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe following tables summarize key financial information by segment:\n\n",

      "answer": "GM's 2023 10-K filing highlights that trucks are central to GM's strategy for maintaining showroom traffic and meeting fuel efficiency standards, even if not all vehicles are individually profitable. On page 101, the filing states that trucks, along with other vehicles, are key to attracting customers and supporting sales volumes for more profitable vehicles. This strategic role is directly connected to the $1.2 billion in transactions disclosed on page 78 with nonconsolidated affiliates, which are explicitly involved in the development, production, and marketing of trucks and other vehicles. These financial transactions indicate GM's reliance on nonconsolidated affiliates to execute its truck production strategy. Thus, the significant financial engagement with affiliates supports the operational execution of a strategy that positions trucks as critical to both fleet and retail sales, as well as regulatory compliance.",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

      "answer": "Starbucks' Channel Development segment, which includes foodservice products distributed primarily by Nestl\u00e9 under the Global Coffee Alliance, accounted for 5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2024. The risk factors highlight that if Nestl\u00e9 fails to meet its distribution and marketing commitments, it could materially impact the Channel Development business, limiting Starbucks' ability to grow this segment.

Unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2024 were as follows: North America (75%), International (20%), and Channel Development (5%).\n\nOur North America and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are in various stages of development and may require more extensive support, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our North America operations.\n\nOur Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Starbucks-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino and Starbucks Doubleshot , foodservice products, and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of our Channel Development business operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9, while our global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba, Nestl\u00e9, and others. \u00ae \u00ae",

An inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the performance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to ex pand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail licensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

Accessories are positioned as part of the broader growth strategy, with investment prioritization intended to fuel future growth. However, Converse, which is the reportable segment responsible for athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, reported a 15% currency-neutral revenue decline in fiscal 2024, driven by drops in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels across key markets. This decline suggests that despite NIKE's strategic emphasis on accessories, Converse\u2014its primary vehicle for executing this strategy\u2014faced executional and market challenges, including reduced traffic and increased promotional activity, which undermined revenue growth.

      "answer": "BKNG identifies online restaurant reservation services as a competitive threat in its risk factors, noting that such services are part of a broader competitive landscape that includes large tech companies and other travel platforms. However, BKNG owns OpenTable, a leading online restaurant reservation brand, which it acquired to expand its service offerings and diversify beyond traditional travel services. Despite this strategic move, BKNG recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment for OpenTable during the 2020 pandemic, reflecting the financial strain on the restaurant reservation segment. This creates a nuanced situation where BKNG both competes with and depends on the success of online restaurant reservation services through its ownership of OpenTable, even as the business has faced significant challenges that led to a major impairment charge.",

          "chunk_text": "for our services, and relationships with travel service providers and other partners, any of which can adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nIntense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\n\nWe compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered the online travel market and grown rapidly by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through flight, hotel, and alternative accommodations meta-search products (\"Google Flights\", \"Google Hotel Ads\", and \"Google Vacation Rentals\"), its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality, \"Google Travel\" (a planning tool that aggregates its flight, hotel, and packages products), and integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into Google Maps. In particular, Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights have grown rapidly and achieved significant market share in a relatively short time. As the economy and the travel industry recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the structure of the travel industry or consumer preferences could change in ways that could disadvantage us and benefit certain of our existing competitors or new entrants. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting international travel restrictions and social distancing practices, we saw a shift in favor of domestic travel and alternative accommodations. This shift could benefit competitors that are more well established in domestic markets and alternative accommodations than we are. As a result, our historical strengths may not provide the competitive advantages that they did prior to the pandemic. If we are unable to successfully adapt to any changes in how the travel industry operates or to changes in the ways in which consumers purchase travel services, our ability to compete, and therefore our business and results of operations, would be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with companies that provide a variety of products and services, including:\n\n- online travel reservation services;\n- online accommodation search and/or reservation services that are focused primarily on alternative accommodations;\n- large online companies, including search, social networking and marketplace companies;\n- traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers and tour operators, many of which combine physical locations, telephone services, and online services;\n- travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines) that have their own branded online platforms to which they drive business;\n- online travel meta-search and price comparison services;\n- \"Super apps\" that offer consumers a wide range of everyday and other services including travel bookings;\n- companies offering new rental car business models or car- or ride-sharing services that affect demand for rental cars, some of which have developed innovative technologies to improve efficiency of point-to-point transportation and extensively utilize mobile platforms;\n- online restaurant reservation services; and\n- companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers, including large global distribution systems (\"GDSs\") and hospitality software platforms.\n\nMeta-search services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service providers, online travel companies (\"OTCs\"), and other online platforms and in many instances compete directly with us for customers. Google leverages its general search business to promote its meta-search offerings by showing meta-search results at the top of its organic search results. Google and other meta-search services may evolve into more traditional OTCs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly through their platforms. If consumers book travel services through a service such as TripAdvisor's \"Instant Booking,\" Google's \"Book on Google,\" or directly with a travel service provider without using an OTC like us, or if meta-search services limit our participation within",

At the same time, we continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands in our efforts to provide consumers with the most comprehensive and value-oriented services. We invest resources to support organic growth by all our brands, whether through increased marketing, geographic expansion, technological innovation, or increased access to accommodations, flights, rental cars, restaurants, or other services.\n\n- Invest in profitable and sustainable growth. We seek to offer online services that meet the needs and the expectations of consumers, travel service providers, and restaurants and that we believe will result in mutual longterm profitability and growth. We intend to accomplish this through continuous investment and innovation, growing our businesses in new and current markets, expanding our services, and ensuring that we provide an appealing, intuitive, and easy-to-use consumer experience. We have made significant investments in people, technology, marketing, and expanded, new, or additional services, such as improving the selection of our extensive collection of accommodations including homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay, expanded flight and ground transportation offerings, payments, and other offerings. In 2021, we continued to scale our flight offerings to more markets, and offer payments solutions to more customers and partners. We continue to seek to maximize the benefits of our scale by sharing resources and technological innovations among our brands and co-developing new services. We also regularly evaluate, and may pursue and consummate, potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, or investments, whether to expand our businesses into complementary areas, expand our current businesses, acquire innovative technology, or for other reasons. For instance, in December 2021, we completed the acquisition of Getaroom, a business-to-business distributor of hotel rooms, which in conjunction with our Priceline business we expect to increase value for both hotel and affiliate partners, and in November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group.\n\n## Service Offerings\n\nBooking.com and Rentalcars.com.

      "question": "How does GM's production of automobile parts connect with its financial stake in nonconsolidated affiliates, particularly in light of its strategic initiatives and transactions involving component parts?",
      "answer": "GM produces a wide range of automobile parts as part of its broader automotive operations, which are marketed through retail and fleet channels (page 101). These parts are not only manufactured internally but also developed and produced in collaboration with nonconsolidated affiliates, as noted in the transactions section (page 78). GM maintains a financial stake in these affiliates, which are involved in various aspects of the development, production, and marketing of trucks, crossovers, cars, and automobile parts. The company engages in transactions to purchase and sell component parts and vehicles with these affiliates, indicating a strategic interdependence. This relationship supports GM\u2019s broader strategic initiatives by allowing it to leverage external production capabilities while maintaining financial flexibility through nonconsolidated structures.",

      "answer": "The 15% currency-neutral revenue decline in Converse\u2014driven by reduced wholesale and direct-to-consumer sales in North America and Western Europe\u2014creates a challenge for NIKE\u2019s strategic objective of growing its athletic accessories portfolio. As a reportable segment, Converse is specifically tasked with lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, which are core components of NIKE\u2019s broader accessories strategy outlined in the MD&A. Despite this decline, NIKE continues to prioritize investment in digital platforms and consumer experiences to elevate its brand, including within Converse. However, the contraction in Converse\u2019s gross margin by 130 basis points and the 30% drop in EBIT raise concerns about the segment\u2019s ability to contribute meaningfully to the company\u2019s strategic growth in accessories, particularly in light of increased promotional activity and lower ASPs.",

      "question": "How does NIKE's foreign exchange hedging strategy for product costs relate to its operational dependency on the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), and what impact does this have on inventory cost volatility?",
      "answer": "NIKE's foreign exchange hedging strategy is closely tied to its product cost exposures, which are largely generated through purchases from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a U.S. Dollar-denominated sourcing hub. NTC buys products from third-party factories and sells them to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure. NIKE manages this exposure using cash flow hedges, including currency forwards and options, to stabilize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on product costs. However, when NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the resulting foreign exchange exposure directly affects inventory costs. A stronger U.S. Dollar increases inventory costs for entities with non-dollar functional currencies, while a weaker Dollar reduces them. Therefore, the effectiveness of NIKE's hedging strategy directly influences the volatility of inventory costs across its global operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NKE](page_84) \u2192 [Product]: NIKE purchases product primarily through the NTC, generating foreign currency exposure due to differing functional currencies across entities.",
        "Hop 2: [Product] \u2192 [NTC]: The NTC operates in U.S. Dollars and sells products to NIKE entities in their local functional currencies, creating exposure that NIKE hedges using cash flow hedge instruments.",
        "Hop 3: [NTC] \u2190 [NKE](page_48): NIKE depends on the NTC for product sourcing, and the exposure from NTC-to-entity sales is a key component of NIKE\u2019s transactional foreign currency risk, directly impacting inventory cost volatility."

In 2023, income from qualifying innovative activities was taxed at 9% under Dutch corporate income tax law, up from 7% in previous years, and applied to a portion of Booking.com's earnings. This tax incentive still had a significant beneficial impact on the effective tax rate, but the decrease in the benefit compared to the prior year partially offset the overall tax savings. The Innovation Box Tax is tied to Dutch law, which increased the standard corporate tax rate from 25% to 25.8% effective January 1, 2022, further influencing the company's tax planning and effective rate calculations.",

      "question": "How does BKNG's strategic investment in KAYAK align with its broader business model, particularly considering KAYAK's reliance on short-term agreements with travel service providers and BKNG's significant international revenue exposure?",
      "answer": "BKNG\u2019s investment in KAYAK is aligned with its broader mission to make it easier for consumers to experience the world by offering a meta-search service that aggregates travel options from various providers. However, KAYAK's business model depends heavily on short-term agreements with travel service providers \u2014 many of which can be terminated on 30 days' notice \u2014 posing a risk to KAYAK\u2019s ability to maintain comprehensive travel data and attract users. This dependency mirrors BKNG\u2019s own reliance on travel service providers across its platforms, including Booking.com, which generates approximately 87% of BKNG\u2019s consolidated revenues internationally. Given that both BKNG and KAYAK are exposed to similar risks \u2014 such as provider withdrawal, reduced participation, or market consolidation \u2014 the investment in KAYAK amplifies BKNG\u2019s exposure to these vulnerabilities rather than diversifying around them. Therefore, BKNG\u2019s strategic rationale for investing in KAYAK must weigh the value of expanded service offerings and user reach against the compounding risk of shared dependencies on third-party travel service providers, particularly in international markets that already dominate its revenue base.",

          "chunk_text": "reservations to customers through us. We are in regular dialogue with our major travel service providers about the nature and extent of their participation in our services. A significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service providers or providers that are particularly popular with consumers for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share, and results of operations. To the extent any of those major or popular travel service providers ceased to participate in our services in favor of one of our competitors' services or decided to require consumers to purchase services directly from them, our business, market share, and results of operations could be harmed. During periods of higher occupancy rates, accommodation providers may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservations through thirdparty intermediaries like us, in particular through our discount services. Further, as consolidation among travel service providers increases, the potential adverse effect of a decision by any particular significant travel service provider (such as a large hotel chain, airline, or rental car company) to withdraw from or reduce its participation in our services also increases. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk that our travel service provider and restaurant partners voluntarily or involuntarily declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease or limit their operations, which could harm our business and results of operations. In particular, the potential harm to our business and results of operations is greater if there are bankruptcies or closures of larger partners such as airlines, hotel chains, or large rental car companies. To the extent restaurants limit the availability of reservations through OpenTable or if a significant number of restaurants cease to participate in our services or if government restrictions limit occupant capacity of any travel service providers or restaurants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers may not continue to use our services and/or our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nKAYAK, a meta-search service, depends on access to information related to travel service pricing, schedules, availability, and other related information from OTCs and travel service providers to attract consumers. Many of KAYAK's agreements with OTCs and travel service providers are short-term agreements that may be terminated on 30 days' notice. To the extent OTCs or travel service providers no longer provide such information to KAYAK, KAYAK's ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumers could be diminished and its brand, business, and results of operations could be harmed. To the extent consumers do not view KAYAK as a reliable source of comprehensive travel service information, fewer consumers would likely visit its websites, which would also likely have a negative impact on KAYAK's advertising revenue and results of operations. In addition, if OTCs or travel service providers choose not to advertise with KAYAK or choose to reduce or eliminate the fees paid to KAYAK for referrals from query results, KAYAK's business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\n\nWe have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies and acquisitions of complementary businesses in furtherance of our mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. For example, we acquired Getaroom in December 2021 to enhance our business-to-business distribution capabilities for hotel partners and more effectively support our accommodations affiliate partners, and in November 2021 we entered into an agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management's attention from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, new risks with which we are not familiar, legal compliance obligations that previously did not apply to us, integration risks, and difficulties and unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions. As a result, entering new businesses involves risks and costs that could, if realized, have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, profit margins, cash flows or financial condition, as well as on our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any such investments or acquisitions.\n\nWe may decide to make minority investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have limited or no management or operational control. The controlling person in such a case may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and decisions of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or business or adversely affect the value of our investment.\n\nWe acquired a substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible assets in acquisitions. If we determine that any of our goodwill and intangible assets, or any goodwill or intangible assets acquired in future transactions experiences a decline in value we may be required to record an impairment, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we may issue shares of our common stock in these transactions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or combine internal businesses.\n\nThe integration of acquired businesses requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. In addition to acquired businesses, we have integrated certain of our businesses that had been managed",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, and the Section entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any forward-looking statements, which may be due to factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We connect consumers who wish to make travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. We also offer various other services to consumers and partners, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants.\n\nWe offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. We continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive services. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Reporting for information on our operating segments.\n\nThe results of our business outside of the U.S. consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda, and Rentalcars.com in their entirety and the parts of the KAYAK and OpenTable businesses located outside of the U.S. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services, or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com (which is domiciled in the Netherlands) at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the U.S. is part of the results of our businesses outside of the U.S. In 2021, the revenues from our businesses outside of the U.S. (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com through facilitating accommodation reservations) represented approximately 87% of our consolidated revenues. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.\n\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from advertising services, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and various other services, such as travelrelated insurance revenues.\n\n## Trends\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of travel restrictions by governments around the world resulted in a significant decline in travel activities and consumer demand for related services in 2020 in particular. Accommodation room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, declined rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic spread in the first quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the second quarter of 2020. Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and through 2021, accommodation room night declines versus the comparable period in 2019 have generally improved as government-imposed travel restrictions have eased, vaccines and other medical interventions have become more widespread, and consumer demand for travel has started to rebound. However, there have been periods of worsening trends due to spikes in COVID-19 cases and newly implemented travel restrictions, primarily related to new variants.",

      "answer": "Nike's balance sheet as of May 31, 2023, shows no redeemable preferred stock liability (page 62), which might suggest that the stock is either not outstanding or not classified as a liability under accounting standards. However, the detailed disclosure on page 79 clarifies that Sojitz America is the sole owner of $0.3 million in redeemable preferred stock, which is redeemable at par value at the option of either party. Despite the absence of the liability on the balance sheet, the company emphasizes that no dividends may be declared or paid on common stock unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. This contractual obligation remains in effect even though the preferred stock is not shown as a liability, likely due to its redemption terms. This dynamic underscores how Nike must prioritize preferred dividend payments before any common stock distributions, influencing its capital allocation strategy and dividend policy. The lack of balance sheet presentation could reflect classification under equity or disclosure treatment under GAAP, but the operational impact on capital policy remains intact.",

      "question": "How does the risk of reduced participation by travel service providers impact the viability of KAYAK's meta-search model, particularly in light of BKNG's $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge related to KAYAK in 2020?",
      "answer": "BKNG's business, including KAYAK, is heavily dependent on the participation of travel service providers who supply pricing, schedules, and availability data. If these providers reduce or terminate their participation, KAYAK's ability to offer comprehensive and reliable travel information is diminished, which could reduce consumer trust and traffic to its platform. This dependency is a material risk, especially in the context of the ongoing effects of the pandemic, which has already strained relationships with service providers and led to operational disruptions. BKNG recognized this risk financially in 2020 when it recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge related to KAYAK, signaling a significant decline in the expected future economic benefits from the acquisition. This impairment underscores the vulnerability of KAYAK\u2019s business model to disruptions in access to travel service provider data, and raises concerns about the long-term viability of the meta-search model if travel service provider participation continues to decline.",

          "chunk_text": "variants of COVID-19 has caused uncertainty as to when restrictions will be lifted, if additional restrictions may be initiated or reimposed, if there will be permanent changes to travel behavior patterns, and the timing of distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical interventions globally.\n\nIn 2021, many countries experienced spikes in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of variants of COVID-19. We believe that as vaccines and other medical interventions that prevent or reduce the impact of COVID-19 become widespread globally, people will increasingly feel it is safe to travel again and government restrictions will be relaxed, although the timing remains uncertain.\n\nOur business is dependent on the availability of a large number of accommodations (particularly independently-owned accommodations) and restaurants, and on the ability of consumers to travel to such accommodations and restaurants on airlines, railways, and rental cars. The ability of consumers to travel across international borders has been significantly impacted by the various travel restrictions between countries. We do not expect economic and operating conditions for our business to recover fully until there is widespread consumer confidence and ability to travel, and our travel service provider and restaurant partners are able to meet the demand for services. This may not occur until well after the broader global economy begins to improve. Additionally, our business is also dependent on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending patterns. Any increased unemployment is likely to have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending, including for the travel and restaurant industries. Even though we have seen some improvements in the economic and operating conditions for our business since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole. If the travel and restaurant industries are fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are detrimental to our operating model, our business may continue to be adversely affected even as the broader global economy recovers.\n\nOur financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government restrictions resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and a significant decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes to our accommodation room nights trends. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Trends. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. These include, but are not limited to, the severity, extent, and duration of the global pandemic, including as a result of any new variants of COVID-19 and any resurgences of the pandemic; availability and efficacy of vaccines and other medical interventions to prevent or alleviate COVID-19, and their impacts on the travel and restaurant industries and consumer spending more broadly; actions taken by national, state, and local governments to contain the disease or treat its impact; the impact on attrition, as well as the changes in hiring levels and remote working arrangements that we have implemented on our operations, including the health and productivity of management and our employees, and our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls; the impact on our contracts and relationships with our partners; our ability to withstand increased cyberattacks; the speed and extent of the recovery across the broader travel ecosystem; and the duration, timing, and severity of the impact on customer spending, including how long it takes to recover from the economic recession resulting from the pandemic. The effects of the pandemic may continue to fluctuate throughout the world, which could continue to affect our business. Also, restrictions in affected regions could be extended after the virus has been contained in order to avoid relapses and there may be restrictions on certain travel activity related to whether travelers have been vaccinated. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial performance, it may also heighten many of the other risks identified in this section.\n\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or hire, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed.\n\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, including key senior management in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We may not be able to retain the services of members of our senior management or other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position. We had approximately 20,300 employees worldwide at December 31, 2021. Our future success and ability to innovate and develop products, services, technologies, and enhancements depends on our continuing to identify, attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees across our organization, and changes in our workforce may make that more difficult. In addition, our customer service resources and outsource arrangements for customer support may be unable to provide adequate customer service support, particularly during peak periods. As a result of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for a long recovery period for the travel industry, it is possible our employees may not view employment with us as positively as they did prior to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will have a long-term effect on how and from where people work, the attractiveness of our office environments, and remote working policies, and there may continue to be operational and workplace cultural challenges that may adversely affect our business, including talent retention, in the",

          "chunk_text": "reservations to customers through us. We are in regular dialogue with our major travel service providers about the nature and extent of their participation in our services. A significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service providers or providers that are particularly popular with consumers for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share, and results of operations. To the extent any of those major or popular travel service providers ceased to participate in our services in favor of one of our competitors' services or decided to require consumers to purchase services directly from them, our business, market share, and results of operations could be harmed. During periods of higher occupancy rates, accommodation providers may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservations through thirdparty intermediaries like us, in particular through our discount services. Further, as consolidation among travel service providers increases, the potential adverse effect of a decision by any particular significant travel service provider (such as a large hotel chain, airline, or rental car company) to withdraw from or reduce its participation in our services also increases. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk that our travel service provider and restaurant partners voluntarily or involuntarily declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease or limit their operations, which could harm our business and results of operations. In particular, the potential harm to our business and results of operations is greater if there are bankruptcies or closures of larger partners such as airlines, hotel chains, or large rental car companies. To the extent restaurants limit the availability of reservations through OpenTable or if a significant number of restaurants cease to participate in our services or if government restrictions limit occupant capacity of any travel service providers or restaurants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers may not continue to use our services and/or our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nKAYAK, a meta-search service, depends on access to information related to travel service pricing, schedules, availability, and other related information from OTCs and travel service providers to attract consumers. Many of KAYAK's agreements with OTCs and travel service providers are short-term agreements that may be terminated on 30 days' notice. To the extent OTCs or travel service providers no longer provide such information to KAYAK, KAYAK's ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumers could be diminished and its brand, business, and results of operations could be harmed. To the extent consumers do not view KAYAK as a reliable source of comprehensive travel service information, fewer consumers would likely visit its websites, which would also likely have a negative impact on KAYAK's advertising revenue and results of operations. In addition, if OTCs or travel service providers choose not to advertise with KAYAK or choose to reduce or eliminate the fees paid to KAYAK for referrals from query results, KAYAK's business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\n\nWe have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies and acquisitions of complementary businesses in furtherance of our mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. For example, we acquired Getaroom in December 2021 to enhance our business-to-business distribution capabilities for hotel partners and more effectively support our accommodations affiliate partners, and in November 2021 we entered into an agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management's attention from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, new risks with which we are not familiar, legal compliance obligations that previously did not apply to us, integration risks, and difficulties and unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions. As a result, entering new businesses involves risks and costs that could, if realized, have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, profit margins, cash flows or financial condition, as well as on our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any such investments or acquisitions.\n\nWe may decide to make minority investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have limited or no management or operational control. The controlling person in such a case may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and decisions of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or business or adversely affect the value of our investment.\n\nWe acquired a substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible assets in acquisitions. If we determine that any of our goodwill and intangible assets, or any goodwill or intangible assets acquired in future transactions experiences a decline in value we may be required to record an impairment, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we may issue shares of our common stock in these transactions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or combine internal businesses.\n\nThe integration of acquired businesses requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. In addition to acquired businesses, we have integrated certain of our businesses that had been managed",

      "answer": "Home Depot pays dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units and performance shares in the form of additional shares upon vesting or payout, rather than in cash, which aligns compensation value with stock price performance over time (page 69). In contrast, under accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements, the company receives an initial delivery of shares and may receive additional shares at settlement based on the volume-weighted average price over the agreement term, with the final share delivery acting as a mechanism to efficiently execute share repurchases rather than as compensation (page 66). These two uses of 'additional shares' serve different purposes: one relates to equity compensation and the accrual of dividend value until vesting, while the other is a financial instrument for returning capital to shareholders through repurchases.",

Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019. Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.\n\nWe have also granted performance share awards under the Plans.

This suggests limited reinvestment in the Converse brand despite Nike's stated strategic focus on accessories. The lack of significant capital allocation to Converse raises questions about the alignment between Nike's strategic emphasis on accessories and the execution through its Converse segment, which is explicitly tasked with producing accessories (page 89).

T he N IKE  Brand segm ents are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in N I KE  Brand sales activity.\n\nEach NIKE  Brand geographic segm ent operates predom inantly in one industry: the design, developm ent, m arketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipm ent. T he Company's reportable operating segm ents for the N IKE  Brand are: N orth Am erica; E urope, M iddle E ast &amp; Africa (\"E M E A\"); G reater C hina; and Asia P acific &amp; Latin Am erica (\"AP LA\"), and include results for the N IKE  and Jordan brands. R efer to N ote 18 - D ivestitures for inform ation regarding the transition of N IKE  Brand businesses in certain countries within AP LA to third-party distributors.\n\nThe Com pany's N IKE  D irect operations are m anaged within each N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ent. C onverse is also a reportable segm ent for the C om pany and operates in one industry: the design, m arketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.\n\nGlobal Brand D ivisions is included within the N IKE  Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way m anagem ent views the C om pany. G lobal Brand D ivisions revenues include NIKE  Brand licensing and other m iscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segm ent. G lobal Brand D ivisions costs represent dem and creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally m anaged for the N IKE  Brand, as well as costs associated with N IKE  D irect global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists prim arily of unallocated general and adm inistrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally m anaged departm ents; depreciation and am ortization related to the C om pany's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and com pensation program s, including stock-based com pensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.\n\nThe prim ary financial m easure used by the C om pany to evaluate perform ance of individual operating segm ents is earnings before interest and taxes (\"E BIT \"), which represents N et incom e before Interest expense (incom e), net and Incom e tax expense in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\nAs part of the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program , standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each N IKE  Brand entity in the C om pany's geographic operating segm ents and to C onverse. These rates are set approxim ately nine and twelve m onths in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and sum m er selling seasons) based on average m arket spot rates in the calendar m onth preceding the date they are established. Inventories and C ost of sales for geographic operating segm ents and C onverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. D ifferences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual m arket rates are included in C orporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from  the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and P roperty, plant and equipm ent, net for operating segm ents are regularly reviewed by m anagem ent and are therefore provided below.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 86",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE , I nc. is a worldwide leader in the design, developm ent and worldwide m arketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services. N IKE , Inc. portfolio brands include the N IKE  Brand, Jordan Brand and C onverse. T he N IKE  Brand is focused on perform ance athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services across M en's, W om en's and Kids', am plified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh tradem ark, as well as other N IKE  Brand tradem arks. T he Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jum pm an tradem ark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ents. C onverse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the C onverse, C huck Taylor, All Star, O ne Star, Star C hevron and Jack P urcell tradem arks. In som e m arkets outside the U .S., these tradem arks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, m arket and sell sim ilar products. O perating results of the C onverse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of N IKE , Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"C om pany\" or \"N IKE \"). All significant intercom pany transactions and balances have been elim inated.\n\n## MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statem ents in conform ity with generally accepted accounting principles requires m anagem ent to m ake estim ates, including estim ates relating to assum ptions that affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statem ents and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from  these estim ates.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of N IKE  Brand footwear, apparel and equipm ent, as well as C onverse products, com prise a single perform ance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to custom ers either through wholesale or direct to consum er channels. T he C om pany satisfies the perform ance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the custom er has occurred, based on the term s of sale. A custom er is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale custom ers upon shipm ent or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreem ent with the custom er. C ontrol transfers to retail store custom ers at the tim e of sale and to substantially all digital com m erce custom ers upon shipm ent. T he transaction price is determ ined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from  custom ers. P aym ent term s for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreem ent with the custom er and paym ent is generally required within 90 days or less of shipm ent to or receipt by the wholesale custom er. P aym ent is due at the tim e of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for tradem ark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangem ents, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governm ental authorities that are both im posed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the C om pany from  a custom er, are excluded from  R evenues and C ost of sales in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a custom er are accounted for as fulfillm ent costs and are included in C ost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration prom ised in the C om pany's contracts with custom ers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from custom ers. The C om pany estim ates the m ost likely am ount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against R evenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the tim e revenues are recognized. T he estim ated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 63",

      "question": "How does Starbucks' reliance on Nestl\u00e9 to distribute foodservice products create financial risk given that deferred revenue from Nestl\u00e9 is tied to ongoing performance obligations under the Global Coffee Alliance?",
      "answer": "Starbucks reports that deferred revenue primarily consists of an up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which Starbucks has continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance (page 66). At the same time, the Channel Development segment\u2014which includes foodservice product sales\u2014is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, as they have the global right to sell and distribute Starbucks\u2019 packaged goods and foodservice products (page 88). If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments, it could adversely impact the Channel Development business and have a material effect on financial results (page 22). This creates a dual exposure: Starbucks is financially dependent on a partner (Nestl\u00e9) to realize revenue that is already recognized as deferred, and its ability to meet performance obligations\u2014and thus fully recognize that revenue\u2014is tied to Nestl\u00e9's operational success in distributing Starbucks-branded products globally.",

The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes anti-dilutive stock options or unvested RSUs, which were immaterial in the periods presented.\n\n## Note 16:    Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nStarbucks is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation matters associated with labor union organizing efforts and certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While we are closely monitoring the operational and financial impacts of labor union organizing efforts on our business, as of the date of this filing, we believe the risk of a material contingent loss associated with these litigation matters is remote.\n\n## Note 17:    Segment Reporting\n\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our ceo, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, manages the segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions.\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development.\n\nNorth America and International operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single-serve coffee products, and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale.\n\nChannel Development revenues include packaged coffee, tea, foodservice products, and ready-to-drink beverage sales to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores. Most of our Channel Development revenues are from product sales to, and royalty revenues from, Nestl\u00e9 through the Global Coffee Alliance.\n\nConsolidated revenue mix by product type (in millions):\n\n",

An inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the performance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to ex pand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail licensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

      "question": "How does Nike's divestiture of its South American entities relate to its foreign exchange risk management practices involving the NIKE Trading Company?",
      "answer": "Nike's divestiture of its entities in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, which collectively had held-for-sale assets of $182 million and liabilities of $58 million as of May 31, 2022, represents a strategic shift in its regional operating model. This divestiture strategy contrasts with Nike's reliance on the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a U.S. Dollar-based sourcing hub, to manage product cost foreign currency exposures across its global operations. The NTC purchases products in U.S. Dollars from third-party factories and sells them to Nike entities in their respective functional currencies, creating intercompany transactions that are subject to foreign exchange risk. These exposures are actively hedged under Nike\u2019s foreign exchange risk management program to stabilize consolidated financial results. Thus, while Nike is exiting certain direct operations in South America, it continues to manage FX risk through centralized mechanisms like the NTC, which remains critical to its global supply chain and financial planning.",

At the same time, Nike has significant unrecognized tax benefits totaling $990 million as of May 31, 2024, with $699 million expected to impact the effective tax rate if recognized. These liabilities, combined with accrued interest and penalties of $332 million, represent a material cash outflow risk that could constrain Nike's ability to generate sufficient liquidity to meet both tax obligations and preferred dividend commitments. This financial pressure could, in turn, limit Nike\u2019s capacity to maintain or increase common stock dividends, despite its historical practice of annual shareholder returns.

      "question": "How does Nike's emphasis on accessories in its athletic-focused business model compare with Converse's standalone financial performance as a lifestyle brand, particularly in terms of revenue contribution and profitability trends?",
      "answer": "Nike positions accessories as part of its broader athletic product offerings\u2014footwear, apparel, and equipment\u2014under the Nike Brand, Jordan Brand, and Converse (page 66). Accessories are included within the Nike Brand\u2019s performance and sport-inspired lifestyle products. However, Converse is reported as a standalone operating segment focused on athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories (page 89), indicating a distinct strategic positioning as a lifestyle-oriented brand rather than an athletic performance one. Financially, Converse reported $2.082 billion in revenue for FY2024, a decline from $2.427 billion in FY2023, and its EBIT dropped to $474 million from $676 million over the same period (page 90). This contrasts with Nike\u2019s broader accessories strategy, which is integrated into high-performing segments like North America and EMEA, where Nike Brand revenues grew and EBIT remained strong. The data suggests that while Nike\u2019s accessories benefit from integration into its performance-driven brand ecosystem, Converse\u2019s standalone lifestyle positioning may be experiencing relative financial headwinds.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE , I nc. is a worldwide leader in the design, developm ent and worldwide m arketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services. N IKE , Inc. portfolio brands include the N IKE  Brand, Jordan Brand and C onverse. T he N IKE  Brand is focused on perform ance athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services across M en's, W om en's and Kids', am plified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh tradem ark, as well as other N IKE  Brand tradem arks. T he Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jum pm an tradem ark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ents. C onverse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the C onverse, C huck Taylor, All Star, O ne Star, Star C hevron and Jack P urcell tradem arks. In som e m arkets outside the U .S., these tradem arks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, m arket and sell sim ilar products. O perating results of the C onverse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of N IKE , Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"C om pany\" or \"N IKE \"). All significant intercom pany transactions and balances have been elim inated.\n\n## MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statem ents in conform ity with generally accepted accounting principles requires m anagem ent to m ake estim ates, including estim ates relating to assum ptions that affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statem ents and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from  these estim ates.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of N IKE  Brand footwear, apparel and equipm ent, as well as C onverse products, com prise a single perform ance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to custom ers either through wholesale or direct to consum er channels. T he C om pany satisfies the perform ance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the custom er has occurred, based on the term s of sale. A custom er is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale custom ers upon shipm ent or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreem ent with the custom er. C ontrol transfers to retail store custom ers at the tim e of sale and to substantially all digital com m erce custom ers upon shipm ent. T he transaction price is determ ined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from  custom ers. P aym ent term s for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreem ent with the custom er and paym ent is generally required within 90 days or less of shipm ent to or receipt by the wholesale custom er. P aym ent is due at the tim e of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for tradem ark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangem ents, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governm ental authorities that are both im posed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the C om pany from  a custom er, are excluded from  R evenues and C ost of sales in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a custom er are accounted for as fulfillm ent costs and are included in C ost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration prom ised in the C om pany's contracts with custom ers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from custom ers. The C om pany estim ates the m ost likely am ount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against R evenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the tim e revenues are recognized. T he estim ated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 63",

T he N IKE  Brand segm ents are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in N I KE  Brand sales activity.\n\nEach NIKE  Brand geographic segm ent operates predom inantly in one industry: the design, developm ent, m arketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipm ent. T he Company's reportable operating segm ents for the N IKE  Brand are: N orth Am erica; E urope, M iddle E ast &amp; Africa (\"E M E A\"); G reater C hina; and Asia P acific &amp; Latin Am erica (\"AP LA\"), and include results for the N IKE  and Jordan brands. R efer to N ote 18 - D ivestitures for inform ation regarding the transition of N IKE  Brand businesses in certain countries within AP LA to third-party distributors.\n\nThe Com pany's N IKE  D irect operations are m anaged within each N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ent. C onverse is also a reportable segm ent for the C om pany and operates in one industry: the design, m arketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.\n\nGlobal Brand D ivisions is included within the N IKE  Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way m anagem ent views the C om pany. G lobal Brand D ivisions revenues include NIKE  Brand licensing and other m iscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segm ent. G lobal Brand D ivisions costs represent dem and creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally m anaged for the N IKE  Brand, as well as costs associated with N IKE  D irect global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists prim arily of unallocated general and adm inistrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally m anaged departm ents; depreciation and am ortization related to the C om pany's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and com pensation program s, including stock-based com pensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.\n\nThe prim ary financial m easure used by the C om pany to evaluate perform ance of individual operating segm ents is earnings before interest and taxes (\"E BIT \"), which represents N et incom e before Interest expense (incom e), net and Incom e tax expense in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\nAs part of the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program , standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each N IKE  Brand entity in the C om pany's geographic operating segm ents and to C onverse. These rates are set approxim ately nine and twelve m onths in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and sum m er selling seasons) based on average m arket spot rates in the calendar m onth preceding the date they are established. Inventories and C ost of sales for geographic operating segm ents and C onverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. D ifferences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual m arket rates are included in C orporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from  the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and P roperty, plant and equipm ent, net for operating segm ents are regularly reviewed by m anagem ent and are therefore provided below.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 86",
