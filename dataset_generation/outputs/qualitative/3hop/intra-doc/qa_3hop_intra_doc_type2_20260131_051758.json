      "answer": "ExxonMobil's 2003 Incentive Program supports long-term equity-based compensation through restricted stock units with multi-year vesting schedules, as outlined in the financial statements (page 102). At the end of 2024, 47 million shares remained available for future awards under the program, indicating its ongoing role in compensation planning (page 32). The program was originally approved by shareholders in May 2003 and is formally documented as part of the company's governance and legal filings, as referenced in the exhibit list (page 137), showing its foundational role in the company's executive and employee incentive structure.",

Incentive Program\n\nThe 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, and other forms of awards. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Company and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned by the Corporation. Outstanding awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Options and SARs may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited, ex pire, or are settled in cash do not count against this max imum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified term. New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the ExxonMobil Board of Directors terminates the plan early. At the end of 2024, remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 47 million.\n\nRestricted  Stock  and  Restricted  Stock  U nits. Awards  of  restricted  (nonvested)  common  stock  units  granted  under  the  2003  Incentive  Program  totaled 10,393 thousand, 9,701 thousand, and 9,392 thousand in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities, and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and units in  each  award vesting after three years,  and  the  remaining 50  percent  vesting  after seven years.  Some management, professional, and technical participants will receive awards that vest in full after three years. Awards granted to a small number of senior ex ecutives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years for the remaining 50 percent of the award, except that for awards granted prior to 2020 the vesting of the 10-year portion of the award is delayed until retirement if later than 10 years.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the merger agreement for the Pioneer acquisition, which closed on May 3, 2024, awards of Pioneer restricted stock units granted under the Pioneer Amended and Restated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan (Pioneer L TIP) that did not vest as of immediately prior to the closing were cancelled and converted into awards of ExxonMobil restricted stock units based on the merger exchange ratio. The grant date for the converted Pioneer awards is considered to be the effective date of the acquisition for the purpose of calculating fair value. Compensation costs for the converted Pioneer awards is recognized in income over a period commensurate with the vesting schedule. Pioneer awards vest in three installments over a period of three years with approximately one third of the awards vesting each year. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. The maximum term of the Pioneer awards is three years. As of the Pioneer acquisition closing on May 3, 2024, the maximum number of shares of stock that can be issued under the Pioneer L TIP was 9,458 thousand. At the end of 2024, remaining shares available for awards under the Pioneer LTIP were 9,362 thousand.\n\nThe following tables summarize information about restricted stock and restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n",

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources impact its upstream asset valuation and internal control reporting, and what does the exclusion of Pioneer from internal control assessments suggest about the integration risk and fair value estimation challenges associated with the $63 billion stock-based transaction?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources for $63 billion in stock significantly expanded its upstream footprint in the Permian Basin, increasing 2024 production by approximately 570 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day. However, due to the acquisition occurring in 2024, Pioneer was excluded from the internal control over financial reporting assessment, representing 19% of total assets and 4% of total revenues, raising concerns about the completeness of internal controls during integration. The fair value estimation for Pioneer required significant judgment, particularly in valuing crude oil and natural gas properties using discounted cash flow models, which are sensitive to assumptions about production volumes, commodity prices, and discount rates. This combination of factors suggests that while the acquisition enhances ExxonMobil's upstream position, it introduces material integration and valuation risks that are not fully captured in the current reporting framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Exxon Mobil Corporation and its subsidiaries (the 'Corporation') as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). We also have audited the Corporation's internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2024,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Corporation's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the  Corporation's consolidated financial statements and on the  Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur  audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  ex ists,  and  testing  and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nAs described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Pioneer Natural Resources Company (\"Pioneer\") from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 because it was acquired by the Corporation in a business combination during 2024. We have also excluded Pioneer from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Pioneer is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management's assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent nineteen percent and four percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Unit-of-Production Depreciation\n\nOil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. Acquisition costs of proved properties are depreciated using a ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves while capitalized drilling and developments costs are depreciated using a ratio of actual production volumes to proved developed reserves. The volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to some variability.\n\nIn the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.\n\nTo the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the ex pected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.\n\n## Fair Value Used in Business Combinations\n\nIn accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. If applicable, any ex cess of the purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant group.\n\nOn May 3, 2024, the Corporation acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. To effect the acquisition, we issued 545 million shares of Ex x onMobil common stock having a fair value of $63 billion on the acquisition date, and assumed debt with a fair value of $5 billion.\n\nIn respect of the Pioneer acquisition, the most significant amount of judgment involved the estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment related to crude oil and natural gas properties, for which we used discounted cash flow models. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, commodity prices consistent with the average of third-party industry experts, drilling and development costs, and risk-adjusted discount rates.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.\n\nSee Note 21 for further information regarding the Pioneer acquisition during 2024.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies, in part, on the Corporation's planning and budgeting cycle.\n\nBecause the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation's major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these assets are predominantly based on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, development costs, and production costs. Significant reductions in the Corporation's view of oil or natural gas commodity prices or margin ranges, especially the longer-term prices and margins, and changes in the development plans, including decisions to defer, reduce, or eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances, including indicators outlined in ASC 360, can be indicators of potential impairment as well.\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation ex pects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will ex perience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses.

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n## Upstream\n\nExxonMobil has a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which allows the Corporation to be selective in our investments, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil's competitive strengths enable the Upstream's business strategy, which is focused on developing  an  industry-leading  portfolio  underpinned  by  advantaged  growth  projects,  applying  ExxonMobil's  technology  to  enhance  value  and  improve development efficiency, and leveraging the unique capabilities of the Company's global projects organization to deliver projects on time and in line with budgets.\n\nThe Upstream capital program is focused on low cost-of-supply opportunities. ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects, including continued growth in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as LNG expansion opportunities in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on the current investment plans, the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Currently about two thirds of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater, and LNG  resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment, international trade patterns and relations, and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nIn 2024, crude and gas prices were within the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010-2019). ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference, and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC or OPEC+ and other large government resource owners, alternative energy sources, and other factors.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nGuyana: Liza Destiny, Liza Unity and Prosperity floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels continued to produce above investment basis capacity in 2024. The combined gross production from the three operating vessels exceeded 615 thousand barrels of oil per day (kbd) in 2024 and exceeded 650 kbd in the fourth quarter of 2024. Y ellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail, the fourth, fifth and six th developments on the Stabroek Block, respectively, are progressing on schedule and each has an investment basis capacity of approximately 250 kbd. We announced plans for two additional developments and anticipate eight FPSO vessels will be in operation on the Stabroek Block by year-end 2030. We are working with the government of Guyana to secure regulatory approvals for the seventh project.\n\nPermian: ExxonMobil successfully closed the Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) acquisition in May 2024, significantly increasing our Permian footprint. Total production volumes averaged approximately 1,185 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2024, approximately 570 koebd higher than the previous year. ExxonMobil operations continue to deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and cost performance by leveraging scale, integration, and technology. Examples include deploying ExxonMobil cube design and proprietary proppant as well as leading capabilities and technology in drilling and completions. ExxonMobil remains on track to achieve industry-leading plans of Scope 1 and 2 net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the heritage Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. ExxonMobil expects to roughly double production in the Permian Basin to approximately 2.3 Moebd by 2030. (1)\n\nLNG: ExxonMobil continued work on LNG growth projects in 2024. Production commenced from two new gas wells in Papua New G uinea (PNG ), marking completion of the Angore project and additional supply to support LNG  export from the PNG  LNG  joint venture. In Mozambique, the Rovuma LNG  project began the front-end engineering and design stage in 2024, in support of a final investment decision in 2026, to develop the Area 4 offshore gas resources. Construction continues on the Golden Pass LNG project with Train 1 mechanical completion and first LNG production expected at the end of 2025.\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

      "answer": "ExxonMobil positions Guyana as a core advantaged growth project within its upstream portfolio, citing its high returns and strategic alignment with long-term production growth objectives. In 2024, Guyana's Liza Destiny, Liza Unity, and Prosperity FPSOs exceeded investment basis capacity, producing over 615 kbd of crude oil, with fourth-quarter output surpassing 650 kbd. This operational performance supports the company's forward-looking plans to deploy eight FPSOs on the Stabroek Block by 2030. Additionally, Guyana contributed significantly to reserve additions, with 1.9 GOEB added in 2024 from extensions and discoveries, reinforcing its role in ExxonMobil's upstream growth strategy. This alignment between strategic emphasis, production performance, and reserve growth underscores Guyana's centrality in ExxonMobil\u2019s global upstream positioning.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n## Upstream\n\nExxonMobil has a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which allows the Corporation to be selective in our investments, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil's competitive strengths enable the Upstream's business strategy, which is focused on developing  an  industry-leading  portfolio  underpinned  by  advantaged  growth  projects,  applying  ExxonMobil's  technology  to  enhance  value  and  improve development efficiency, and leveraging the unique capabilities of the Company's global projects organization to deliver projects on time and in line with budgets.\n\nThe Upstream capital program is focused on low cost-of-supply opportunities. ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects, including continued growth in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as LNG expansion opportunities in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on the current investment plans, the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Currently about two thirds of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater, and LNG  resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment, international trade patterns and relations, and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nIn 2024, crude and gas prices were within the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010-2019). ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference, and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC or OPEC+ and other large government resource owners, alternative energy sources, and other factors.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nGuyana: Liza Destiny, Liza Unity and Prosperity floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels continued to produce above investment basis capacity in 2024. The combined gross production from the three operating vessels exceeded 615 thousand barrels of oil per day (kbd) in 2024 and exceeded 650 kbd in the fourth quarter of 2024. Y ellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail, the fourth, fifth and six th developments on the Stabroek Block, respectively, are progressing on schedule and each has an investment basis capacity of approximately 250 kbd. We announced plans for two additional developments and anticipate eight FPSO vessels will be in operation on the Stabroek Block by year-end 2030. We are working with the government of Guyana to secure regulatory approvals for the seventh project.\n\nPermian: ExxonMobil successfully closed the Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) acquisition in May 2024, significantly increasing our Permian footprint. Total production volumes averaged approximately 1,185 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2024, approximately 570 koebd higher than the previous year. ExxonMobil operations continue to deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and cost performance by leveraging scale, integration, and technology. Examples include deploying ExxonMobil cube design and proprietary proppant as well as leading capabilities and technology in drilling and completions. ExxonMobil remains on track to achieve industry-leading plans of Scope 1 and 2 net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the heritage Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. ExxonMobil expects to roughly double production in the Permian Basin to approximately 2.3 Moebd by 2030. (1)\n\nLNG: ExxonMobil continued work on LNG growth projects in 2024. Production commenced from two new gas wells in Papua New G uinea (PNG ), marking completion of the Angore project and additional supply to support LNG  export from the PNG  LNG  joint venture. In Mozambique, the Rovuma LNG  project began the front-end engineering and design stage in 2024, in support of a final investment decision in 2026, to develop the Area 4 offshore gas resources. Construction continues on the Golden Pass LNG project with Train 1 mechanical completion and first LNG production expected at the end of 2025.\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of the world. Our principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission and other new business opportunities, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses. TM\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation's divisions and affiliates have many names, including ExxonMobil , Exxon , Esso, Mobil or XTO .  For convenience and simplicity, in this report  the  terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil, and XTO ,  as  well  as  term s  like Corporation , Company , our , we, and its ,  are  sometimes  used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the contex t in question.\n\nOn May 3, 2024, the Corporation acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. With reference to the acquisition, we issued 545 million shares of ExxonMobil common stock having a fair value of $63 billion on the acquisition date, and assumed debt with a fair value of $5 billion. The acquisition transforms Ex x onMobil's upstream portfolio, creating an industry-leading, high-quality U.S. unconventional inventory position. For additional information, see Note 21 in the Financial Section of this report.\n\nThe energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive, both within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel, and chemical needs of industrial and individual consumers. Certain industry participants, including ExxonMobil, are expanding investments in lower-emission energy and emissionreduction  services  and  technologies.  The  Corporation  competes  with  other  firms  in  the  sale  or  purchase  of  needed  goods  and  services  in  many  national  and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes.\n\nOperating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained in the Financial  Section of this report under the following: 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Business Results' and Note 18. Information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the 'Oil and Gas Reserves' part of the 'Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities' portion of the Financial Section of this report.\n\nExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our businesses. ExxonMobil held over 8 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2024. For technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $102 million in 2024. Although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise, or concession.\n\nExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive, and changing global energy business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-term orientation underpins the Corporation's philosophy on talent development.\n\nTalent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle. Our career-oriented approach to talent development results in strong retention and an average length of service of about 30 years for our career employees.

We strive to play a leading role, regardless of how an energy transition  unfolds. Across  our  portfolio  of  opportunities,  we  retain  investment  flex ibility  to  max imize  shareholder  value.  With  advancements  in technology and clear, consistent, stable, and effective government policies, we aim to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions in our operated assets by 2050. Our net-zero ambition is backed by a comprehensive approach centered on detailed emission-reduction roadmaps for our major operated assets that were completed in 2022. The roadmaps build on the Company's 2030 emission-intensity reduction plans and, notably, include reaching net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in our heritage Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, and by 2035 for Pioneer assets. We continue to update the roadmaps, including to account for portfolio changes, to reflect technology and policy, and to account for the many potential pathways, and the pace of an energy transition. ( 1)\n\nCompared to 2016 levels, our 2030 plans are expected to drive the following reductions:\n\n- 20-30 percent reduction in corporate-wide greenhouse gas intensity;\n- 70-80 percent reduction in corporate-wide methane intensity;\n- 40-50 percent reduction in upstream greenhouse gas intensity; and\n- 60-70 percent reduction in corporate-wide flaring intensity.\n\nOur emission-reduction plans and 2050 net-zero ambition cover Scope 1 and 2 emissions from assets we operate, which now include Pioneer and Denbury.\n\nThe  Corporation  plans  to  continue  to  pursue  advantaged  growth  opportunities  and  lower-emission  investments.  These  investments  are  targeted  at  reducing emissions in the Company's operations as well as reducing the emissions of other companies. At this early stage, stable and supportive policy remains critical to enable emissions reductions, advance technology, and drive scale to improve costs.\n\nExxonMobil's  Low  Carbon  Solutions  business  is  working  with  the  Product  Solutions  and  Upstream  businesses  to  grow  a  pipeline  of  emission-reduction opportunities in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, and carbon materials, as well as lithium to supply the global battery and electric vehicle markets. Our customers, many governments, and strategic partners recognize our combination of experience, skills, and capabilities that have the potential to help reduce emissions for ourselves and others. For example, on the U.S. G ulf Coast, we see an opportunity to create a carbon capture and storage  business  that  will  enable  industrial  customers  to  reduce  their  emissions.  The  acquisition  of  Denbury  ex panded  our  capabilities  in  this  area,  providing ExxonMobil with the largest owned and operated network of CO2 pipelines in the United States, including more than 900 miles of pipelines and multiple CO2 storage sites near the largest industrial complex es on the G ulf Coast. Combining Denbury's assets and our experience we have created the largest CO2 network in the world which gives us a unique ability to help customers in the region reduce their emissions at a lower cost and faster pace. A cost-efficient transportation and storage system has the potential to accelerate carbon capture and storage deployment for both ExxonMobil and our third-party customers. Stable policy support, along with technology advancements and the development of market-driven mechanisms, will continue to be important to the development and deployment of lower-emission solutions.

We also invest in financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities which are carried at fair value. Those instruments are included in short-term investments when they have remaining maturities within one year as of the balance sheet date.\n- Long-Term Investments in Debt Securities -Long-term investments in debt securities includes financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities with remaining maturities greater than one year as of the balance sheet date.  They are carried at fair value and presented within the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line of our consolidated balance sheet.\n- Inventories -We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory.  The majority of our commodity-related inventories are recorded at cost using the LIFO basis.  We measure these inventories at the lower-of-cost-or-market in the aggregate.  Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis.  LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues.  Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs.  Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weighted-average -cost method and the FIFO method, consistent with industry practice.\n- Fair Value Measurements -Assets and liabilities measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability,  either directly or indirectly through market  -corroborated inputs.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.\n- Derivative Instruments -Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  If the right of offset exists and certain  other criteria are met, derivative assets  and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.  Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings.  We do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.\n\n- Oil and Gas Exploration and Development -Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.\n\nProperty Acquisition Costs -Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption PP&amp;E.  Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management's judgment.  Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated  leasehold costs are reclassified to proved  properties.\n\nExploratory Costs -Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred.  Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or 'suspended,' on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found.  If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes.  If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and",

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 for descriptions of our major accounting policies.  Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.  These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually.  We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.\n\n## Oil and Gas Accounting\n\nAccounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry.  The acquisition of G&amp;G seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs.  However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.\n\n## Property Acquisition Costs\n\nAt year-end 2021, we held $9.3 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, and to a lesser extent, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest.  This amount increased by $6.9 billion at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions in the Permian Basin where we have an ongoing significant and active development program.  Outside of the Permian Basin, the remaining $2.0 billion is concentrated in 9 major development areas.  Management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.\n\nFor individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date.  For insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas.  For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high.  This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.  This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.\n\n## Exploratory Costs\n\nFor exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or 'suspended,' on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.",

      "answer": "In 2021, ConocoPhillips significantly increased its capital investment in the Lower 48 to $3,129 million and reported total assets in the region of $41,699 million, reflecting a strategic emphasis on unconventional plays. This investment supported a major upward revision in proved NGL reserves in the Lower 48, driven by the conversion of Concho Permian contracts to a three-stream basis (adding 182 million barrels), infill drilling (44 million barrels), and higher prices (28 million barrels). Despite these reserve additions, the region reported a net loss of $8 million in 2021, indicating that the aggressive investment and reserve growth had not yet translated into profitability, potentially due to timing lags, development costs, or market volatility.",

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' acquisition of Concho and the associated debt assumption and exchange impact its capital structure and credit risk profile, particularly in light of the fair value adjustment and guarantee structure?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips assumed $3.9 billion in principal Concho debt at a fair value of $4.7 billion upon acquisition, resulting in an $800 million fair value adjustment that is being amortized over the notes' remaining term. In a debt exchange, 98% of this debt ($3.8 billion) was exchanged for new ConocoPhillips debt with identical interest rates and maturity dates, while $67 million remained outstanding as Concho debt. The new debt is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips Company, which is part of the Obligor Group that includes ConocoPhillips and Burlington Resources LLC. This guarantee structure provides credit support but also increases ConocoPhillips' consolidated debt burden. Despite the increased debt load, credit ratings remained strong (e.g., S&P 'A-' with stable outlook), though downgrades could increase borrowing costs and restrict access to commercial paper markets. The company maintains a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility with no financial ratio covenants, providing liquidity flexibility despite potential credit risks.",

The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings.  The facility agreement contains  a cross-default provision relating  to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.  The amount of the facility is not subject to the redetermination prior to its expiration date.\n\nCredit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the U.S.  The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts.  The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe revolving credit facility supports ConocoPhillips Company's ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs.  Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.  With no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $6.0 billion in available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2021.\n\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho in an all-stock transaction. In the acquisition, we assumed Concho's publicly traded debt and in December 2020, we launched an offer to exchange Concho's publicly traded debt for debt issued by ConocoPhillips.  There were no impacts to ConocoPhillips' credit ratings as a result of the debt exchange.  In June 2021, we reaffirmed our commitment to preserving our 'A' -rated balance sheet by restating our intent  to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years, driving a more resilient  and efficient capital structure.  See Note 9 and Note 3 .\n\nOn January 25, 2021, S&amp;P revised the industry risk assessment for the E&amp;P industry to 'Moderately High' from 'Intermediate' based on a view of increasing risks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker profitability.  On February 11, 2021, S&amp;P downgraded its rating of our long-term debt from 'A'  to 'A  -' with a 'stable' outlook and affirmed this rating in November 2021.  In October 2021, Moody's affirmed its 'A3' rating of our long-term debt and revised its outlook from 'stable' to 'positive'. In December 2021, Fitch affirmed its rating of our long-term debt as 'A' with a 'stable' outlook.\n\nWe do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings.  If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate  debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets.  If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.\n\nCertain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral.  Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had direct bank letters of credit of $337 million and $249 million, respectively,  which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business.  In the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.\n\nWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.",

In the acquisition, we assumed Concho's publicly traded debt, with an outstanding principal balance of $ 3.9 billion, which was recorded at fair value of $4.7 billion on the acquisition date.  The adjustment to fair value of the senior notes  of approximately $0.8 billion on the acquisition date will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining contractual terms of the senior notes.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we completed a debt exchange offer related to the debt assumed from Concho.  Of the approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of Concho's senior notes offered in the exchange, 98 percent, or approximately $ 3.8 billion, was tendered and accepted.  The new debt issued by ConocoPhillips had the same interest rates and maturity dates as the Concho senior notes.  The portion not exchanged, approximately $67 million, remained outstanding across five series of senior notes issued by Concho.  The debt exchange was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes resulting in a portion of the unamortized fair value adjustment of the Concho senior notes allocated to the new debt issued by ConocoPhillips on the settlement date of the exchange.

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day.  If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.",

This move aligns with the company\u2019s disciplined capital allocation framework, which emphasizes investing in high-return opportunities while maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning significant capital to shareholders. Despite the $1.645 billion investment in APLNG, COP still committed to a $8 billion total return of capital in 2022, including dividends, share repurchases, and the new VROC mechanism. Additionally, this acquisition was part of a broader portfolio optimization effort that included $4\u20135 billion in planned asset sales by 2023, indicating a balanced approach between strategic acquisitions and divestitures to maintain financial flexibility and enhance long-term value creation.",

          "chunk_text": "- Disciplined investments. Our goal is to achieve strong  free cash flow by exercising capital  discipline, controlling our costs, and safely  and reliably delivering production.  We expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the price cycles.  Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return  to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest  back into the business for future cash flow expansion  .\n- o Exercise capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow.  As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities.  We allocate capital  across a geographically diverse,  low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline.  Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis.  Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and G&amp;A.  In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake.  Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders.\n- o Control our costs. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority.  Using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly  in a low commodity price environment.  The ability to control our operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.\n- o Optimize our portfolio. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho and Shell's Permian assets, significantly increasing our unconventional portfolio with many additional years of low cost of supply inventory.  The addition of this highly complementary acreage in the Midland and Delaware basins created a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48.  In our Asia Pacific segment, we notified Origin Energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG and announced the sale of our interests in Indonesia. See Note 3 .\n\nWe continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that don't compete.  As such, in conjunction with our Shell Permian acquisition announcement, we communicated an increase in our planned disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023 as part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts.\n\n- o Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:\n- \u25fe Acquire interest in existing  or new fields.\n- \u25fe Apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.\n- \u25fe Successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.\n\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.  This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.",

The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility  due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist in the future.  Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business.  Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the financial principles that underpin our value proposition; balance sheet strength, peer leading distributions, disciplined investments and ESG excellence, all of which support strong financial returns.\n\n- Balance sheet strength. A strong balance sheet is a strategic  asset that provides flexibility through  price cycles.  We strive to maintain our 'A' -rating, and we have committed to reducing gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years.  This will reduce interest expense and provide resilience in periods of volatility. We ended the year with over $5 billion in cash, maintaining balance sheet strength even after completing the all-cash acquisition of Shell's  Permian assets.\n- Peer leading distributions. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders via our three-tiered return of capital framework, which consists of a growing, sustainable dividend, share repurchases, and beginning in 2022, the addition of VROC.  In 2021, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately $2.4 billion and repurchased $3.6 billion of our common stock partially sourced from our paced monetization program related to the CVE common shares owned.  Our combined dividends and repurchases represented over 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities.  Our first VROC of $0.20 cents per share was paid on January 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2022.  Our VROC will be made at the Board of Director's discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. See Note 5 . See 'Item 1A-Risk Factors Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations.'",

We believe that ConocoPhillips will play an essential role in meeting energy transition pathway demand delivering superior and consistent returns on and of capital through the price cycles, and achieving our net zero ambition on operational emissions, while retaining the flexibility to successfully adapt as the future unfolds.\n\nOur triple mandate is supported by financial principles and capital allocation priorities that should allow us to deliver superior returns through the cycles.  Our financial principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and delivering ESG excellence, all of which are in service to delivering competitive financial returns.  Our 2021 acquisitions of Concho and the Shell Permian assets further reinforce our differential  value proposition.\n\nIn 2021, we successfully delivered on our priorities.  Total company production was 1,567 MBOED yielding cash provided by operating activities of $17 billion.  We invested $5.3 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and provided returns of capital to shareholders of approximately $6 billion through our ordinary dividend and share repurchases.  For 2021, our ordinary dividend returned $2.4 billion which included an increase from 43 cents per share to 46 cents per share, effective in December.  Share repurchases resumed in February and amounted to $3.6 billion inclusive of our paced monetization program related to the Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares owned. See Note 5 .  We also demonstrated our commitment to preserving our top-tier balance sheet with an announcement to reduce the company's gross debt by $5 billion over five years through a combination of natural and accelerated maturities.\n\nAs part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts, in December 2021, we announced two transactions in our Asia Pacific segment enhancing our diverse portfolio.  This included notifying Origin Energy of our intent to exercise  our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments, and the sale of our interests in Indonesia for approximately $1.4 billion before customary adjustments.  In addition to those transactions, in January 2022, we entered into a divestiture agreement to sell our interest in noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment for $440 million.  These transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2022.  For more information on APLNG, see Note 4 and for more information on pending dispositions, see Note 3 .\n\nWe announced an increase in our disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023, with approximately $2 billion sourced from the Permian Basin.  As of year-end 2021, we have generated $0.3 billion in disposition proceeds.  The proceeds from these transactions will be used in accordance with the company's priorities, including returns of capital to  shareholders and reduction of gross debt.\n\nIn December 2021, we announced the initiation of a three-tier return of capital framework.  This framework is structured to continue delivering a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through  -cycle share repurchases.  It includes the addition of a VROC tier.  The VROC tier will provide a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range. We have set our expected 2022 total return of capital from all three tiers at approximately $8 billion.

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' production growth in the Lower 48 in 2023 align with its historical depreciation trends and profitability performance in that region?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips reported an increase in total production of 88 MBOED, with the Lower 48 being a key contributor to this growth. This aligns with the company's operational expansion and new wells coming online in that region. Over the same period, the company recorded $5,729 million in depreciation, depletion, amortization, and impairments for the Lower 48, a significant increase from $4,854 million in 2022 and $4,067 million in 2021, indicating growing capital investment and asset utilization. Meanwhile, the results of operations for the Lower 48 in 2021 showed a profit of $5,208 million, suggesting that despite rising depreciation costs, the region has remained a strong contributor to profitability. This implies that the production growth is translating into financial performance, even as asset wear and usage accelerate.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' 2023 capital expenditures included funding for investments in joint ventures like NFS3, which is part of the company's broader LNG development strategy. The company holds a 25% interest in NFS3, a QatarEnergy-led LNG project, and reports it as an equity method investment in the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa segment. At year-end 2023, the carrying value of this investment was $1.1 billion, aligning with the company's broader capital deployment in LNG ventures such as NFE4 and PALNG. This reflects a strategic focus on LNG infrastructure in key geographies, with capital allocation directly supporting long-term positioning in global gas markets.",

      "question": "What is the strategic significance of ConocoPhillips' investment in NFE4 when considering its capital allocation in 2023, its equity method investment disclosures, and its broader LNG joint venture activity in Qatar?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips allocated capital in 2023 to investments including NFE4, which is a joint venture with QatarEnergy participating in the NFE LNG project and holds a 12.5% interest in the project. As of December 31, 2023, NFE4 is reported as an equity method investment under the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa segment, reflecting ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategic focus on expanding its LNG footprint through partnerships in key global markets like Qatar. This aligns with the company's broader capital strategy to invest in major LNG projects, including other joint ventures such as NFS3 and PALNG, which collectively indicate a deliberate push toward securing long-term LNG production and export capacity.",

        "Hop 1: [COP](page_56) \u2192 [NFE4]: In 2023, NFE4 is listed among key investments funded through capital expenditures, indicating its strategic importance in the company's portfolio.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' investment in PALNG represents a strategic move into large-scale LNG infrastructure, reflected in its $26.7 billion in capital expenditures for 2023, which included funding for PALNG. PALNG is a 30% owned joint venture with Sempra, positioned as part of the company's broader LNG development strategy. This investment is reported under the Corporate and Other segment, aligning with ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategic focus on high-impact, long-term energy infrastructure projects despite not being tied to its core upstream operations. The inclusion of PALNG in both the capital expenditures and equity investment disclosures underscores its importance in the company's portfolio diversification and long-term growth outlook.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [COP](page_56) \u2192 [PALNG]: Capital expenditures for 2023 included funding for PALNG, among other major projects, indicating its strategic importance in the company's investment portfolio.",
        "Hop 2: [COP](page_91) \u2192 [PALNG]: PALNG is listed among significant equity investments, specifically as a 30% owned joint venture, highlighting its role in ConocoPhillips\u2019 broader LNG development strategy.",
        "Hop 3: [COP](page_88) \u2192 [PALNG]: The acquisition of a 30% interest in PALNG is explicitly noted, and it is reported as an equity method investment within the Corporate and Other segment, signaling its distinct strategic positioning outside of core upstream assets."

      "question": "How does Chevron's capital allocation strategy for CPChem's polymer projects align with its ownership stake in the joint venture and the scale of CPChem's global manufacturing footprint?",
      "answer": "Chevron's capital allocation strategy reflects a measured approach to CPChem, with Affiliate Capex in 2025 expected to range between $1.7 to $2.0 billion, where less than half supports CPChem's two major integrated polymer projects\u2014Golden Triangle Polymers in Texas (51% owned) and Ras Laffan Petrochemical in Qatar (30% nonoperated). This aligns with Chevron\u2019s 50% ownership stake in CPChem, indicating selective investment rather than full backing, especially considering CPChem operates 30 manufacturing facilities and two R&D centers globally. The capital allocation suggests Chevron is participating in CPChem's growth without fully committing to the scale of its global infrastructure, possibly to balance risk and reward.",

This aligns with Chevron's broader production strategy, where volumes from affiliates like Tengizchevroil are part of its upstream production mix, though not explicitly quantified in the data provided. Despite the capex reduction, Tengizchevroil contributed $3.033 billion in equity earnings in 2024, indicating continued strong financial performance from the joint venture.

      "answer": "Chevron's 36.4% ownership in Angola LNG, as stated in the financial statement disclosures, aligns with its upstream production commitments where Angola LNG processes and liquefies natural gas for international markets. The investment had a carrying value of $1,665 million at year-end 2024, and contributed $405 million in equity earnings, indicating its role in Chevron\u2019s upstream portfolio. Additionally, Angola LNG is integrated into Chevron\u2019s production volumes, reflecting its operational significance in liquefaction and global gas delivery. Together, these perspectives highlight Chevron's strategic focus on LNG as a key component of its international upstream operations.",

      "answer": "Chevron's acquisition of PDC significantly influenced its natural gas reserves, capital investment, and production dynamics in the DJ Basin. From a reserves perspective, the acquisition added 2.2 TCF of natural gas in 2023 and contributed 45 million barrels of extensions and discoveries in the DJ Basin in 2024. In terms of capital investment, the acquisition represented a gross investment at cost of $10,487 million in 2023. Regionally, the PDC acquisition was primarily responsible for 177 BCF in natural gas purchases in the United States in 2024, reinforcing Chevron\u2019s strategic focus on the DJ Basin as a key growth area. Together, these perspectives show that the PDC acquisition was a pivotal move for Chevron to expand reserves and production capacity in the DJ Basin, supported by significant capital outlay.",

Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

This decision reflects a shift toward more stable and high-impact regions such as Kazakhstan, where Chevron expanded production capacity through the Future Growth Project, and Angola and Australia, where new exploration acreage and infrastructure investments were highlighted in 2024 developments.

This aligns with management's acknowledgment that changes in the pace of energy transition could materially affect asset valuations and business plans. Furthermore, the risk factors section explicitly identifies the pace of energy transition as a core risk influencing commodity price volatility and investment in lower-carbon alternatives, which could slow upstream investment and increase asset impairment risks.

          "chunk_text": "This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which includes a description of the 'successful efforts' method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.\n\nImpairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However,  the  impairment  reviews  and  calculations  are  based  on  assumptions  that  are  generally  consistent  with  the  company's business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in  Note  18  Properties,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  to  the  section  on  Properties,  Plant  and  Equipment  in  Note  1  Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are  made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable.  Similarly,  a  significant  downward  revision  in  the  company's  crude  oil  or  natural  gas  price  outlook  would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also,  if  the  expectation  of  sale  of  a  particular  asset  or  asset  group  in  any  period  has  been  deemed  more  likely  than  not,  an impairment  review  is  performed,  and  if  the  estimated  net  proceeds  exceed  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  or  asset  group,  no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets' associated carrying values.\n\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company's carrying value.  When  this  occurs,  a  determination  must  be  made  as  to  whether  this  loss  is  other-than-temporary,  in  which  case  the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's PP&amp;E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions  and  judgments,  including  such  factors  as  the  existence  of  a  legal  obligation,  estimated  amounts  and  timing  of settlements,  discount  and  inflation  rates,  and  the  expected  impact  of  advances  in  technology  and  process  improvements.  A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2021 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets  and  the  number  of  assumptions  involved  in  the  estimates.  That  is,  favorable  changes  to  some  assumptions  would  have reduced  estimated  future  obligations,  thereby  lowering  accretion  expense  and  amortization  costs,  whereas  unfavorable  changes would  have  the  opposite  effect.  Refer  to  Note  25  Asset  Retirement  Obligations  for  additional  discussions  on  asset  retirement obligations.\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company's pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.\n\nThe determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan",

Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 2. Properties\n\nThe location and character of the company's crude oil and natural gas properties and its refining, marketing, transportation, and chemicals  facilities  are  described  beginning  on  page  3  under  Item  1.  Business.  Information  required  by  Subpart  1200  of Regulation  S-K  ('Disclosure  by  Registrants  Engaged  in  Oil  and  Gas  Producing Activities')  is  also  contained  in  Item  1  and  in Tables I through VII on pages 97 through 109 and Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment.\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nThe following is a description of legal proceedings that involve governmental authorities as a party and the company reasonably believes would result in $1.0 million or more of monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, under federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the refinery in Pasadena, Texas acquired by Chevron on May 1, 2019 (Pasadena Refining System, Inc. and PRSI  Trading  LLC)  has  multiple  outstanding  Notices  of  Violation  (NOVs)  that  were  issued  by  the  Texas  Commission  on Environmental Quality related to air emissions at the refinery. The Pasadena refinery is currently negotiating a resolution of the NOVs with the Texas Attorney General. Resolution of these alleged violations is expected to result in the payment of a civil penalty of $1.0 million or more.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the California Department of Conservation, California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) (previously known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) promulgated revised rules pursuant to the Underground Injection Control program that took effect April 1, 2019. Subsequent to that date, CalGEM issued NOVs and two orders to Chevron related to seeps that occurred in the Cymric Oil Field in Kern County, California. An October 2, 2019 CalGEM order seeks a civil penalty of approximately $2.7 million. Chevron has filed an appeal of this order. Chevron is currently in discussions with CalGEM to explore a global settlement to resolve the order and all past and present seeps in the Cymric Field, which would increase the amount of penalty paid.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Environmental Protection Agency notified Noble Energy, Inc., Noble Midstream Partners LP and Noble Midstream Services, LLC of potential penalties for alleged Clean Water  Act  violations  at  two  facilities  in  Weld  County,  Colorado  relating  to  a  2014  flood  event  and  requirements  for  a  Spill Prevention and Countermeasures Plan and Facility Response Plan. The parties have negotiated a resolution of these issues with the agencies, which was approved by the U.S. District Court, District of Colorado on September 28, 2021.

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nAs a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\n\nImpacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on Chevron's financial and operating results The economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic  and  the  disruption  to  capital  markets  have  been  and  continue  to  be  far  reaching.  While  the  oil  and  gas industry  witnessed  a  substantial  recovery  of  commodity  prices  and  demand  for  products  during  2021,  there  continues  to  be uncertainty  and  unpredictability  about  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  financial  and  operating  results  in  future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any further resurgences of the COVID-19 virus and its variants, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy  and  economic  activity,  including  travel  restrictions  and  prolonged  low  demand  for  our  products;  the  ability  of  our affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and, correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides; and Chevron's ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products.\n\nThe company's suppliers continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor has been strained. This strain on the financial health of the company's suppliers could put pressure on the company's financial results  and  may  negatively  impact  supply  assurance  and  supplier  performance.  In-country  conditions,  including  potential  future waves of the COVID-19 virus and its variants in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity.\n\nIn light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is currently  unable  to  develop  with  any  level  of  confidence  estimates  and  assumptions  that  may  have  a  material  impact  on  the company's  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial  or  operational  performance  in  any  given  period.  In  addition,  the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight.\n\nIn addition, the continuation or further resurgences of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks.\n\nChevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company's results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due to the COVID19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, geopolitical risks, the pace of energy transition, and governmental regulations and policies regarding the development of oil and gas reserves. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit  ratings,  potentially  increase  financing  costs  and  reduce  access  to  capital  markets. The  company  may  be  unable  to  realize anticipated  cost  savings,  expenditure  reductions  and  asset  sales  that  are  intended  to  compensate  for  such  downturns,  and  such downturns  may  also  slow  the  pace  and  scale  at  which  we  are  able  to  invest  in  new  business  lines  such  as  the  lower  carbon businesses associated with our Chevron New Energies",

      "question": "What is the full financial and operational impact of Chevron's acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc., considering its exclusion from internal control assessment, its treatment in the independent auditor's report, and its influence on upstream capital expenditures?",
      "answer": "Chevron's acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. had a multi-faceted impact. First, PDC was excluded from Chevron's internal control assessment over financial reporting due to its acquisition in 2023, representing 5% of total assets and 1% of total revenue. Second, the independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, also excluded PDC from its audit of internal controls, aligning with management's assessment. Third, the acquisition directly affected Chevron's upstream capital expenditures, with a reported $10.5 billion allocated to the PDC acquisition in 2023, significantly influencing the year-over-year increase in upstream Capex from $9.6 billion in 2022 to $13.7 billion in 2023.",

      "answer": "Chevron reported a decline in income from equity affiliates in 2023, partly due to lower earnings from CPChem. Despite this, Chevron continued to invest in CPChem's integrated polymer projects, allocating $3.5 billion in affiliate capital expenditures in 2023, with a significant portion directed toward CPChem. Chevron maintains a 50% equity ownership in CPChem, indicating a strategic commitment to the chemical joint venture despite short-term financial headwinds.",

      "question": "How does Chevron's discussion of the pace of energy transition impact its upstream asset impairment decisions, strategic investments in lower-carbon technologies, and long-term upstream earnings outlook?",
      "answer": "Chevron evaluates the pace of energy transition as a key factor in determining upstream asset impairments, particularly when assessing future cash flows and fair value estimates for properties, plant, and equipment. In 2023, the company impaired a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to regulatory challenges linked to the energy transition. At the same time, Chevron is strategically investing in lower-carbon technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and geothermal through its Chevron New Energies division, aiming to align with the evolving energy landscape. Looking ahead, the company notes that the pace of energy transition will influence long-term upstream earnings trends, alongside regulatory changes and fiscal terms of contracts, indicating a dual focus on managing legacy assets while preparing for a lower-carbon future.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CVX](page_56) \u2192 Energy Transition Pace: The company considers the pace of the energy transition as part of its impairment assessments, with impairments triggered by changes in environmental regulations and expectations of future asset sales. Specific impairments in 2023 were tied to regulatory challenges in California.",
        "Hop 2: [CVX](page_21) \u2192 Energy Transition Pace: Chevron New Energies is advancing the company's strategy by investing in hydrogen, carbon capture, and geothermal technologies, indicating a proactive response to the energy transition.",
        "Hop 3: [CVX](page_38) \u2192 Energy Transition Pace: The pace of energy transition is cited as a key factor influencing long-term upstream earnings trends, alongside regulatory changes and fiscal terms of contracts."

      "question": "How does Chevron's $0.7 billion investment in Republic of Congo's offshore and natural gas projects in 2023 align with its operational footprint in OPEC+ countries and its broader upstream strategy in politically sensitive regions?",
      "answer": "Chevron invested $0.7 billion in 2023 in offshore and natural gas projects in the Republic of Congo (page_109), a country that is part of Chevron\u2019s broader upstream portfolio in OPEC+ nations, where approximately 26% of its 2023 net oil-equivalent production occurred (page_39). Despite geopolitical risks\u2014such as those highlighted by Chevron\u2019s exposure to government actions, sanctions, and regional conflicts (page_39)\u2014the company continues to strategically allocate capital to key production regions like the Republic of Congo. This investment reflects Chevron\u2019s ongoing commitment to maintaining and potentially expanding its upstream footprint in politically sensitive OPEC+ countries, aligning with its long-term upstream strategy of focusing on core assets in regions with significant production contributions.",

      "question": "How do Chevron's financial investment in Tengizchevroil, capital allocation plans for the FGP/WPMP Project, and production commitments reflect its strategic dependency on the joint venture in 2023?",
      "answer": "Chevron's strategic dependency on Tengizchevroil is evident through three key dimensions. First, financially, Chevron holds a 50% equity stake and has extended a $4.5 billion loan to Tengizchevroil to fund the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP/WPMP), indicating a significant financial commitment beyond its carrying value of the investment (page 82). Second, in terms of capital allocation, nearly half of Chevron's $3.5 billion Affiliate Capex in 2023 was directed toward Tengizchevroil's FGP/WPMP project, underscoring its prioritization in Chevron\u2019s broader investment strategy (page 50). Third, operationally, Chevron's production volumes reported include output from Tengizchevroil, highlighting its integral role in Chevron\u2019s upstream production commitments and delivery obligations (page 9). Together, these elements demonstrate that Tengizchevroil is a cornerstone of Chevron's upstream strategy in 2023.",

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's acquisition of Denbury Inc. impact its internal control over financial reporting and operational activities, especially considering the exclusion of Denbury from control assessments and its contribution to ExxonMobil's U.S. oil and gas operations?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil acquired Denbury Inc. in 2023, which contributed 2% of total assets and less than 1% of total revenues to ExxonMobil\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Due to the timing of the acquisition, Denbury was excluded from ExxonMobil\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, as well as the independent audit of those controls. Despite this exclusion, Denbury\u2019s operations\u2014including oil and gas assets in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions\u2014were integrated into ExxonMobil\u2019s broader U.S. upstream activities, where development focused on liquids-rich opportunities. This acquisition expanded ExxonMobil\u2019s operational footprint while introducing a short-term gap in internal control coverage for a small but strategically relevant portion of its business.",

        "Hop 1: [XOM](page_78) \u2192 [Denbury Inc.]: Denbury was excluded from the audit of internal control over financial reporting due to its acquisition in 2023, representing 2% of total assets and less than 1% of revenues.",
        "Hop 2: [XOM](page_33) \u2192 [Denbury Inc.]: Denbury was also excluded from management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, with the same asset and revenue percentages noted.",

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's financial treatment of equity companies in upstream operations compare with their hydrocarbon reserve contributions across crude oil, natural gas, and synthetic oil categories?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's upstream results for 2023 show that equity companies contributed $617 million in crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves and 6,473 billion cubic feet in natural gas reserves, but they also generated a net loss of $519 million from these entities when excluding other upstream activities. In contrast, consolidated subsidiaries held significantly larger reserves, including 457 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 14,092 billion cubic feet of natural gas in proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2023. This indicates that while equity companies represent a meaningful portion of resource base, particularly in natural gas, they underperformed financially compared to the consolidated operations during the reporting period.",

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's Corporate Plan integrate long-term commodity price assumptions, greenhouse gas emission costs, and global policy trends to shape its capital allocation strategy and impairment assessments across its asset base?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's Corporate Plan integrates long-term commodity price assumptions, such as crude oil and natural gas prices, refining and chemical margins, and foreign currency exchange rates, to guide capital allocation and impairment assessments. The plan incorporates estimated greenhouse gas emission costs, even in jurisdictions without current pricing policies, to align with its 2030 emission-reduction goals, including net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in the Permian Basin. These assumptions are grounded in the Global Outlook, which reflects the existing policy environment and anticipates increasing policy stringency and technology improvements through 2050, although it does not project the full extent of changes needed to meet net-zero by 2050. The Board-reviewed Corporate Plan ensures consistency in evaluating investment opportunities and assessing asset recoverability using these long-term assumptions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [XOM](page_88) \u2192 [Corporate Plan]: The Corporate Plan is the mechanism for allocating capital, operating expenses, and people across the company. It uses long-term commodity price assumptions, greenhouse gas emission costs, and production volumes to estimate future undiscounted cash flows for impairment assessments.",
        "Hop 2: [XOM](page_74) \u2192 [Corporate Plan]: The Corporate Plan's assumptions, including crude oil and natural gas prices, greenhouse gas emission costs, and production volumes, are used in impairment testing. These assumptions are reviewed and approved by the Board and are consistent with investment evaluation criteria.",
        "Hop 3: [XOM](page_45) \u2192 [Corporate Plan]: The Corporate Plan is informed by the Global Outlook, which reflects current policy trends and anticipates future policy and technology changes through 2050. Capital investment guidance for lower-emission opportunities is based on the Corporate Plan, though actual investment depends on policy support, permitting, and returns."

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's $7.433 billion in long-lived assets in Papua New Guinea (page 115) reflects a significant existing commitment to the region. This aligns with the active development of LNG projects such as Papua LNG, Muruk, and P'nyang (page 98), which are in various stages of planning and execution. The company's strategic emphasis on LNG expansion, including Papua New Guinea as a key geography, is explicitly stated in the Upstream section (page 52), where it notes progress on front-end engineering for the Papua New Guinea LNG project with a final investment decision expected in 2024. Together, these elements indicate that Papua New Guinea is a focal point for ExxonMobil's LNG growth strategy, supported by both historical asset investment and current project development activity.",

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's production volume and reserve data for Canada and the Americas compare with the region's projected future cash flows and tax implications, and what does this suggest about the strategic importance of the region to ExxonMobil's long-term financial outlook?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's production data from page 61 shows that Canada and the Americas contributed 560 thousand barrels daily of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, and synthetic oil in 2021, a slight increase from 2020 (536 thousand barrels). From page 137, the region held 776 million barrels of proved liquids reserves and 2,894 million barrels of bitumen reserves as of December 31, 2021, indicating a substantial resource base. However, page 142 reveals that while the Americas contributed $28.71 billion in discounted future net cash flows in 2021, the region also carried a significant future income tax expense of $12.004 billion. This suggests that while the region is strategically important due to its large reserves and production volume, it also carries a notable tax burden that could affect long-term profitability unless offset by operational efficiencies or tax planning strategies.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil operates in Papua New Guinea under the Oil and Gas Act, where exploration licenses can last up to 14 years with area relinquishments, and development licenses can extend up to 45 years. In 2021, ExxonMobil held 3.4 million net acres in PNG, of which 1.2 million were offshore, and relinquished 2.1 million net offshore acres. The company's operations in PNG have open tax years from 2008 through 2021, indicating a long-standing presence with ongoing tax scrutiny or regulatory engagement.",

In 2021, one concession was extended to 2031.\n\n## United Arab Emirates\n\nAn interest in the development and production activities of the offshore Upper Zakum field was acquired in 2006. In 2017, the governing agreements were extended to 2051.\n\n## AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA\n\n## Australia\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  conducted  offshore  in  Commonwealth  waters  are  governed  by  Federal  legislation. Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses were  granted  initially  for  21  years,  with  a  further  renewal  of  21  years  and  thereafter  indefinitely,  i.e.,  for  the  life  of  the  field. Effective from July 1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely. In each case, a production license may be terminated if no production operations have been carried on for five years.\n\n## Papua New Guinea\n\nExploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended. Petroleum development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension for further consecutive period(s) of up to 20 years may be granted at the Minister's discretion. Petroleum retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years. Petroleum  retention  licenses  are  granted  for  five-year  terms,  and  may  be  extended,  at  the  Minister's  discretion,  twice  for  the maximum  retention  time  of  15  years.  Extensions  of  petroleum  retention  licenses  may  be  for  periods  of  less  than  one  year, renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five years, provided that the total period of all extensions granted does not exceed 10 years.",

Development  activities  continued  on  the  Upper  Zakum  1  MBD Sustainment project.\n\n## AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA\n\n## Australia\n\nExxonMobil's net acreage totaled 1.8 million acres offshore and 10 thousand acres onshore at year-end 2021.\n\nThe co-venturer-operated Gorgon Jansz liquefied natural gas (LNG) development consists of a subsea infrastructure for offshore production and transportation of the gas, a 15.6 million tonnes per year LNG facility and a 280 million cubic feet per day domestic gas  plant  located  on  Barrow  Island,  Western  Australia.  The  Jansz-Io  Compression  project  was  funded  in  2021.

A total of 18.3 million net acres were held at year-end 2021.\n\n## 6. Delivery Commitments\n\nExxonMobil sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations, some of which may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity for periods longer than one year. ExxonMobil also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be a combination of our own production and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 28 million barrels of oil and 2,500 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2022 through 2024. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with  production  from  our  proved  developed  reserves. Any  remaining  commitments  will  be  fulfilled  with  production  from  our proved undeveloped reserves and purchases on the open market as necessary.",

      "answer": "The Lower 48 region has played a significant role in COP's production growth, with proved natural gas reserves increasing from 4,658 Bcf in 2021 to 5,736 Bcf in 2024, driven by extensions, discoveries, and revisions. These reserve additions were partially offset by production and sales, yet the region still showed a net increase of over 1,000 Bcf. Operationally, the Lower 48 maintained relatively stable production costs, averaging $11.13 per barrel of oil equivalent in 2024, slightly up from 2023 but still below several other international regions. Additionally, the 2024 revisions to future cash inflows and production costs in the Lower 48 reflect ongoing adjustments in economic forecasting, indicating the region's evolving financial contribution to COP's overall portfolio.",

      "answer": "The 2024 technical revisions show a net positive impact on ConocoPhillips' upstream reserve quality, with crude oil reserves seeing a 28 million barrel increase due to technical revisions in Canada and offsetting some declines in Europe, while NGLs experienced a 52 million barrel upward revision primarily in the Lower 48. Natural gas saw the largest technical revision increase at 113 BCF in the Lower 48, which supports continued investment in unconventional plays. In Alaska, technical revisions were mixed\u2014positive 24 BCF for gas to be consumed in operations but negative 10 million barrels for crude oil\u2014indicating constrained production capacity due to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit. These revisions suggest that technical improvements are enhancing reserve recoverability in unconventional basins, which may lower finding and development costs over time, while Alaska's infrastructure limitations and Europe's downward revisions signal increasing operational challenges that could pressure production cost structures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [COP](page_142) \u2192 Technical Revisions: In crude oil reserves, 2024 saw technical revisions of +28 million barrels in Lower 48 and Canada, offset by -10 million barrels in Alaska and -3 million in Europe, indicating regional variability in reserve quality improvements.",
        "Hop 2: [COP](page_146) \u2192 Technical Revisions: Natural gas reserves experienced a significant +113 BCF technical revision in Lower 48, +64 BCF in Europe, and +55 BCF in equity affiliates, showing strong technical improvements in unconventional gas plays and international operations.",
        "Hop 3: [COP](page_144) \u2192 Technical Revisions: NGL reserves increased by +52 million barrels in Lower 48 due to technical revisions, aligning with continued development of unconventional plays and stream conversion optimization from prior acquisitions.",
        "Synthesis: Technical revisions across all three hydrocarbon types (crude oil, natural gas, NGLs) indicate improving reserve recoverability, particularly in Lower 48 unconventional plays, which enhances asset quality and may reduce unit finding costs. However, mixed revisions in Alaska and Europe suggest infrastructure and operational constraints that could increase production costs and require strategic prioritization."

      "answer": "The Marathon Oil acquisition aligns with ConocoPhillips' strategy of delivering competitive returns through several key financial and strategic elements. First, the transaction involved issuing approximately 143 million shares of ConocoPhillips common stock at a fair value of $111.93 per share, totaling roughly $16.5 billion, which reflects a strategic allocation of equity to expand the company's portfolio without significant cash outlay. Second, the pro forma financials show that Marathon Oil contributed $6,168 million in total revenues and $1,312 million in net income, enhancing ConocoPhillips' overall earnings and diversifying its revenue base. Finally, the company expects to capture approximately $1 billion in annual synergies within the first full year post-acquisition, which supports the strategic objective of improving profitability and delivering returns across commodity price cycles.

The fair value is based on the number of eligible shares of\n\nMarathon Oil common stock at a 0.255 exchange ratio and ConocoPhillips' average stock price on November 22, 2024, which was $111.93.\n\n**Cash transferred at close primarily represents funds contributed to Marathon Oil for repayment of Marathon Oil's estimated commercial paper liabilities as of the closing date.\n\n***Liabilities incurred are related to cash settled share-based awards and payment of cash in lieu of fractional Marathon Oil shares outstanding. These liabilities were settled prior to the end of 2024.\n\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination under FASB Topic ASC 805 using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as we identify new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date to consider. At December 31, 2024, remaining items to finalize include allocation of fair value to unproved properties. The impact of finalizing the fair value allocation is not expected to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis is the company's analysis of its financial performance and of significant trends and uncertainties that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes, and supplemental oil and gas disclosures included elsewhere in this report. It contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to the company's plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words 'ambition,' 'anticipate,' 'believe,' 'budget,' 'continue,' 'could,' 'effort,' 'estimate,' 'expect,' 'forecast,' 'goal,' 'guidance,' 'intend,' 'may,' 'objective,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'potential,' 'predict,' 'projection,' 'seek,' 'should,' 'target,' 'will,' 'would' and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company's disclosures under the heading: 'CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE 'SAFE HARBOR' PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,' beginning on page 65.\n\nThe terms 'earnings' and 'loss' as used in Management's Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss).\n\n## Business Environment and Executive Overview\n\nConocoPhillips is one of the world's leading E&amp;P companies based on both production and reserves with operations and activities in 14 countries. Our diverse, l ow cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; global LNG developments; oil sands in Canada; and an inventory of global exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 11,800 people worldwide and had total assets of $123 billion.\n\n## Completed Acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The acquisition adds high-quality, low cost of supply, development opportunities to our existing Lower 48 portfolio and additional LNG capacity to our global LNG portfolio through Equatorial Guinea.\n\nAt closing, the acquisition was valued at approximately $16.5 billion, in which 0.255 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock was exchanged for each outstanding share of Marathon Oil common stock, resulting in the issuance of approximately 143 million shares of ConocoPhillips common stock. We also assumed $4.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt for Marathon Oil, which was recorded at fair value of $4.7 billion as of the closing date. We expect to capture approximately $1 billion in synergies on a run rate basis within the first full year following the close of the transaction. See Note 3 and Note 8.\n\n## Overview\n\nAt ConocoPhillips, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile, and our view is that a successful business strategy in the E&amp;P i ndustry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. As such, we are unhedged, remain committed to our disciplined investment framework and continually monitor market fundamentals, including the impacts associated with geopolitical tensions and conflicts, global demand for our products, oil and gas inventory levels, governmental policies, inflation and supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe macro-environment of the global energy industry continues to evolve. We believe ConocoPhillips plays an essential role in responsibly meeting the global demand for energy, while continuing to deliver competitive returns on and of capital and working to meet our previously established emissions-reduction targets. We call this our Triple Mandate, and it represents our commitment to create long-term value for stockholders. Our value proposition to deliver competitive returns to stockholders through price cycles is guided by our foundational principles which consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance.",
