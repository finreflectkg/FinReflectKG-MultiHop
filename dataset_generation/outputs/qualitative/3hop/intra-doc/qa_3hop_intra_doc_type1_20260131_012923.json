      "question": "How does GD's reliance on commercial paper issuances for liquidity needs align with the $4 billion credit facility's role in supporting those issuances, given the company's emphasis on maintaining a strong balance sheet?",
      "answer": "GD emphasizes cash flow generation and prudent capital deployment to maintain a strong balance sheet. It views commercial paper issuances as a supplement to operating cash flow for meeting liquidity needs. However, the company also maintains a $4 billion committed credit facility that explicitly supports these commercial paper issuances, acting as a backup liquidity source. This dual approach reflects a strategy that balances operational flexibility with financial stability, especially as the credit facility is set to expire in March 2027, prompting potential renewal or replacement planning.",

      "answer": "UPS utilizes NAV as a practical expedient to value certain alternative investments, including private equity funds, due to the lack of readily determinable fair values. These NAV-based investments include UPS\u2019s $2.7 billion in unfunded commitments to private equity and other limited partnerships, which are expected to be funded over the next three to six years. Given that redemptions in these funds are generally restricted until the end of the partnership term (10\u201315 years), this creates a liquidity risk, as UPS must manage its cash flow commitments without the ability to easily liquidate these positions. The use of NAV introduces valuation uncertainty, which compounds the challenge of managing liquidity against these long-term, illiquid commitments.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "answer": "The acquisition of AspenTech in fiscal 2022 established Emerson's 55% ownership stake, which led to the inclusion of AspenTech's stock-based compensation plans in Emerson's consolidated financials. By fiscal 2024, AspenTech's stock compensation expenses had reached $55 million, contributing to the broader increase in Emerson's total stock compensation expense, which stood at $260 million in 2024. This reflects the integration of AspenTech's performance shares and other equity incentives into Emerson's broader compensation framework, showing a strategic alignment in incentivizing talent post-acquisition.",

      "question": "How does MMM's decision to exit PFAS manufacturing by 2025 align with its ability to meet customer demand for PFAS-free products, especially in applications like lithium-ion batteries and printed circuit boards?",
      "answer": "MMM's decision to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, as outlined in the environmental matters section, reflects a strategic shift toward reducing its reliance on PFAS compounds. However, the company acknowledges that in certain applications\u2014such as lithium-ion batteries, printed circuit boards, and seals and gaskets\u2014PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties may continue to be used beyond 2025 due to regulatory or industry standards, customer re-certification timelines, or the lack of available PFAS-free alternatives. Meanwhile, the risk section on page 13 highlights that customer preferences are shifting toward PFAS-free products, which directly affects demand for MMM's offerings.

The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of those compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of those compounds by the end of 2008. The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter-chainlength PFAS compounds. These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company's policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3M's current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions with respect to PFAS: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M is progressing toward the exit of all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. The Company continues to discuss its PFAS manufacturing exit, and related issues involving the disposition of manufacturing assets, with customers, government authorities, and other stakeholders, and the Company remains focused on completing the exit in a timely and orderly fashion.\n\n3M is also working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025 and has made progress in eliminating the use of PFAS across its product portfolio in a variety of applications. With respect to PFAS-containing products not manufactured by 3M in the Company's supply chains, the Company continues to evaluate the availability and feasibility of third-party products that do not contain PFAS. Depending on the availability and feasibility of such thirdparty products not containing PFAS, the Company continues to evaluate circumstances in which the use of PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties and used in certain applications in 3M's product portfolios, such as lithium ion batteries, printed circuit boards and certain seals and gaskets, all widely used in commerce across a variety of industries, and in some cases required by regulatory or industry standards, may or are expected to, depending on applications, continue beyond 2025. In other cases, sales of products manufactured before the end of 2025, regulatory approval, or customer re-certification or re-qualification of substitutes or replacements to eliminate the use of PFAS manufactured by third parties may not be completed, or, depending on circumstances, are not expected to be completed, by the end of 2025. With respect to PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties, the Company intends to continue to evaluate beyond the end of 2025 the adoption of third-party products that do not contain PFAS to the extent such products are available and such adoption is feasible.\n\n## PFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\n\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of ex posure and use information, risk assessment activities, and increasingly stringent restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions and environmental media, in some cases moving towards presently non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulatory limits for PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are being set at increasingly low levels. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS, including PFAS compounds manufactured by 3M, used in current 3M products or generated as byproducts or degradation products from certain 3M production processes. Finally, in certain jurisdictions, legislation is being considered that, if enacted, might authorize the recovery from individuals or entities costs alleged to have been imposed on the jurisdiction's healthcare system, as well as related costs. If such activity continues, including as regulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of regulation-related litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3M's reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation ex posure to the ex tent legal defenses rely on regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception. G iven divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory drinking water and other environmental standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.",

The development and use of artificial intelligence may present risks to the Company's business. Also, the rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment relating to artificial intelligence, in the United States and internationally, could impact the Company's implementation of artificial intelligence technology, and increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. While the Company will seek to develop and use artificial intelligence responsibly, and will attempt to identify and mitigate ethical, privacy, legal or other issues presented by its use, there can be no assurance that the Company will be fully successful in doing so, and may be subject to data breaches, allegations of unauthorized access to, or use of, third party data, information, or intellectual property rights, or other risks, which may lead to financial losses, legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage.\n\nThe failure to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations could result in significant civil fines and penalties or criminal sanctions against the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. These laws and regulations prohibit corrupt payments by the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents. The Company is also required to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls under the FCPA's accounting provisions. From time to time, the Company receives reports internally and externally, via various reporting channels deployed by its Ethics and Compliance function or otherwise (such as shareholder communications), about business and other activities that raise compliance or other legal or litigation issues. The Company has in the past, and in the future could be, required to investigate such reports and cooperate with U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities in such investigations, audit, monitor compliance or alter its practices as part of such investigations, and the Company has in the past and may in the future be required to pay fines or penalties related to its practices. While the Company maintains and implements U.S. and international compliance programs, including policies and procedures, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of noncompliance, the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents may violate such policies and procedures and engage in practices that contravene relevant laws and regulations.\n\nThe Company's results of operations could experience a material adverse effect if the costs to comply with these evolving treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are greater than projected by the Company. In addition, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are difficult to reliably predict, may differ from the Company's ex pectations, and have resulted and may in the future result in, one or more of the following: criminal or civil sanctions, including fines; limitations on the ex tent to which the Company can conduct business; employee and business partner terminations due to policy violations; and private rights of action that result in litigation ex posure, including ex penses and costs incurred in connection with settlement or court proceedings, for the Company. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of these acts is ex pensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance to mitigate monetary exposure, the amount of the liability that may result from certain of these risks is unlikely to be fully covered by applicable insurance, and to the ex tent covered, will ex ceed the applicable limits of such insurance. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows or its consolidated financial position. In addition, negative publicity related to the matters noted above or other matters involving the Company may negatively impact the Company's reputation. The Company also relies on patent and other intellectual property protection, and challenges to the Company's intellectual property rights, or claims that the Company's activities interfere with the intellectual property rights of a third party, could cause the Company to incur significant expenses to assert or defend against such claims, could result in reduced revenue, and could damage the Company's reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 19, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Products and Customer Preferences\n\n* The Company's results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\n\nDemand for the Company's products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by, among other things, (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company's pricing strategies; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers, vendors, or channel partners; (iv) changes in customers' preferences for our products, including preferences for products that do not contain PFAS, the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company's products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, block-chain, expanded analytics, and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.",

      "question": "How does the change in UPS Retirement Plan contribution structure for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2025, relate to the IRS limits on tax-qualified defined contribution plans, and how does this reflect a broader shift in UPS's retirement benefits strategy as evidenced by the cessation of future benefit accruals in the UPS Retirement Plan for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023?",
      "answer": "The UPS Retirement Plan for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2025, will receive a flat 3% annual contribution, down from a range of 3% to 8% based on years of vesting service prior to this change. This adjustment aligns with IRS limits on tax-qualified defined contribution plans, which cap contributions and compensation levels for such plans. UPS also ceased future benefit accruals for non-union participants in the UPS Retirement Plan effective January 1, 2023, signaling a strategic shift toward defined contribution plans like the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan. This reflects a broader trend of reducing long-term pension liabilities and transferring retirement risk to employees, while still offering competitive retirement benefits within regulatory constraints.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(page_87) \u2192 IRS Limits: UPS's defined contribution plans are subject to IRS limits on maximum compensation and contribution amounts for tax-qualified plans, which influences how much can be contributed on behalf of employees.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor postretirement medical plans in the U.S. that provide healthcare benefits to certain non-union retirees, as well as select union retirees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multiemployer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least 10 years of service who have reached age 55 and employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan for employees not covered under collective bargaining agreements, and several smaller defined contribution plans for certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. We match, in cash, a portion of the participating employees' contributions. Matching contributions charged to expense were $161, $161 and $153 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nBeginning in 2023, non-union employees, including those previously accruing benefits in the UPS Retirement Plan, receive an annual retirement contribution of 5% to 8% (3% to 8% prior to 2023 for employees hired after July 1, 2016) of eligible compensation to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service. Effective January 1, 2025, the UPS Retirement Plan contribution for certain non-union employees with an employment commencement date on or after January 1, 2025 is 3% of eligible compensation, regardless of years of vesting service. Retirement contributions charged to expense were $359, $380 and $83 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan provides for transition contributions to certain participants hired prior to 2008. The amounts charged to expense for transition contributions were $108 and $128 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no transition contributions in years prior to 2023.\n\nContributions under this plan are subject to maximum compensation and contribution limits for a tax-qualified defined contribution plan as prescribed by the IRS. The UPS Restoration Savings Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan for amounts that exceed these benefit limits.\n\nContributions are also made to defined contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were $135, $132 and $119 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nWe also sponsor certain international defined contribution plans, which are not individually material.\n\n## Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n\nInformation about net periodic benefit cost for the company-sponsored pension and postretirement defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Boeing amended its Five-Year Credit Agreement in August 2022, with Citibank, N.A. serving as administrative agent, indicating Citibank's central role in managing the agreement. This role is further reinforced in the exhibit list on page 125, which shows Boeing entered into multiple credit agreements with Citibank, including a new Five-Year Credit Agreement in August 2023. Together, these details suggest a sustained and deepening financial partnership between Boeing and Citibank, particularly in structuring and administering Boeing\u2019s credit facilities.",

      "question": "How does GE's concern about contingent liabilities from its insurance subsidiaries, including UFLIC, reconcile with the long-term risks associated with structured settlement annuities that UFLIC reinsures, particularly given the inability to adjust premiums on these contracts?",
      "answer": "GE expresses concern on page 35 about contingent liabilities and loss estimates from its insurance subsidiaries, including the potential for adverse effects on UFLIC due to solvency concerns or litigation, such as the ongoing issues related to Bank BPH in Poland. These liabilities could materially affect GE's financial position or results of operations. UFLIC, as noted on page 20, is a key reinsurer of structured settlement annuities, which carry long-term risks such as mortality and reinvestment risk in a low-interest-rate environment. Importantly, structured settlement annuities do not allow for premium increases or benefit reductions, which means UFLIC must bear the full financial burden of any longevity or interest rate shocks. This inability to adjust pricing creates a direct tension with GE's broader concern about future liabilities from its insurance operations, suggesting that UFLIC's structured settlement annuity portfolio could amplify GE's exposure to unanticipated financial strain over decades, especially if current assumptions about life expectancy or reinvestment yields prove inaccurate.",

        "Hop 2: [UFLIC] \u2192 [Structured Settlement Annuities]: UFLIC is identified as a primary reinsurer of structured settlement annuities, which are long-duration contracts with no ability to adjust premiums or benefits.",
        "Hop 3: [Structured Settlement Annuities] \u2190 [GE](page_20): GE outlines the specific risks of structured settlement annuities, including mortality and reinvestment risk, which could extend liabilities beyond current estimates and cannot be mitigated through premium adjustments."

This specific role is further reinforced by Citibank\u2019s involvement in other credit facilities, including the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the newly established Five-Year Credit Agreement both dated August 24, 2023. These multiple agreements across different reporting periods demonstrate a deepening and ongoing partnership with Citibank, N.A., not only as an administrative agent but also as a key financing provider, suggesting strategic reliance on Citibank for liquidity and credit support.",

      "answer": "Boeing's KC-46A Tanker program, a $19 billion contract with the U.S. Air Force, faced significant factory disruptions in 2021, including supply chain issues and evolving customer requirements for the Remote Vision System. These disruptions led to a $402 million reach-forward loss recorded in Q4 2021. This loss aligns with earlier financial exposure noted in the form of $243 million in capitalized precontract costs and $409 million in potential termination liabilities to suppliers as of December 31, 2021. The combined figures suggest that the program's financial risk was already substantial before the Q4 charge, indicating ongoing challenges in managing cost overruns and performance risks under the fixed-price contract structure.",

This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixedprice incentive fee contract and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized seven low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 94 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots are valued at approximately $19 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had approximately $243 of capitalized precontract costs and $409 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers.\n\n## Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts\n\nOur final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess  the  merits  of  claims  and  where  appropriate  reserve  for  amounts  disputed.  If  we  are  unable  to  satisfactorily resolve  disputed  costs,  we  could  be  required  to  record  an  earnings  charge  and/or  provide  refunds  to  the  U.S. government.\n\n## Severance\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in the severance liability during 2021 and 2020:\n\n",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

This was partially offset by lower revenues on rotorcraft programs, Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than the prior year, largely due to the lower charges described below.\n\nBDS revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52 upgrades, proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $312 million  higher  than  the  comparable  period  in  the  prior  year,  largely  due  to  the  KC-46A Tanker  charges  during 2020.\n\n## Earnings From Operations\n\nBDS earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $5 million compared with 2020 primarily due to less unfavorable impacts from cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which improved $219 million from the prior year, largely due to lower KC-46A Tanker charges in 2021 compared to 2020 and other charges in development programs described below. The favorable change in cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was offset primarily by lower volume and mix on rotorcraft programs and lower equity earnings for United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  increased  the  reach-forward  loss  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker  program  by $402 million primarily due to continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved.

      "answer": "GE's decision to close UFLIC to new business in 2004 reflects a strategic move to limit future exposure to insurance underwriting risks, particularly in products like structured settlement annuities. However, the company still reinsures approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities, 27% of which were underwritten on impaired lives, with projected payments extending decades into the future. These contracts expose GE to mortality improvement risk\u2014where policyholders live longer than expected\u2014and reinvestment risk in a low interest rate environment. Since these annuities do not allow for additional premiums or benefit reductions, the company must manage long-term liabilities with fixed terms, which contrasts with the original rationale for ceasing new business at UFLIC. This creates a tension between the historical risk mitigation strategy and the ongoing financial obligations tied to this legacy portfolio.",

Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made.

Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits.

Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made.

We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

      "answer": "Boeing's KC-46A Tanker program, a fixed-price development contract valued at approximately $19 billion as of December 31, 2021, involves significant technical complexity and cost estimation risks. In Q4 2021, Boeing recorded an additional $402 million in losses on the KC-46A contract due to factory disruptions, supply chain issues (including those from the pandemic), and increased costs from evolving customer requirements for the Remote Vision System. This aligns with the broader risk disclosures that highlight how fixed-price contracts, particularly development ones like the KC-46A, expose Boeing to potential losses if cost estimates are exceeded.

          "chunk_text": "## Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs more fully described in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin  at  completion.  The  process  of  estimating  margin  at  completion  involves  estimating  the  costs  to  complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Fixedprice development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reachforward losses.\n\nGiven  the  complexity  of  certain  of  the  Company's  fixed-price  development  contracts,  including  the  KC-46A  Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We  evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  used  in  developing  its estimates.\n- We  evaluated  the  reasonableness  of  judgments  made  and  significant  assumptions  used  by  management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the range and probability of reasonable outcomes, and the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates.\n- We performed inquiries of the Company's project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate  management's ability  to  achieve  the  key  cost  and  schedule  estimates,  as  well  as  evaluate  project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project.\n- We  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  key  data  used  in  developing  estimates.  We  developed independent  expectations  of  reasonable  outcomes  using,  in  part,  the  program's  data  and  compared  our expectations to management's estimates.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop  key  estimates,  including  controls  over  the  key  data  used  in  developing  the  estimates  and  the mathematical extrapolation of such data.\n- We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial  statement  impact,  including  the  appropriateness  of  the  timing  of  changes  to  key  estimates,  when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management's estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

      "answer": "Boeing's increased reach-forward loss of $185 million on the Commercial Crew program in 2021 reflects the financial risks inherent in fixed-price development contracts, which are subject to significant cost overruns due to technical complexity and evolving customer requirements. This aligns with the broader context from page 19, where Boeing notes that fixed-price contracts\u2014especially development ones\u2014carry the risk of reduced margins or losses if estimated costs exceed projections. The Commercial Crew program, as a fixed-price development contract, is specifically highlighted in the audit section as one of the most complex and uncertain contracts to estimate, requiring specialized audit procedures due to the high degree of judgment and variability in cost projections. The audit process included evaluating management's assumptions, testing data accuracy, and performing retrospective reviews, all of which underscore the difficulty in forecasting costs and the potential for future financial adjustments. Thus, the Commercial Crew loss is not an isolated issue but emblematic of the systemic challenges Boeing faces with fixed-price development programs.",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

          "chunk_text": "## Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs more fully described in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin  at  completion.  The  process  of  estimating  margin  at  completion  involves  estimating  the  costs  to  complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Fixedprice development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reachforward losses.\n\nGiven  the  complexity  of  certain  of  the  Company's  fixed-price  development  contracts,  including  the  KC-46A  Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We  evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  used  in  developing  its estimates.\n- We  evaluated  the  reasonableness  of  judgments  made  and  significant  assumptions  used  by  management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the range and probability of reasonable outcomes, and the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates.\n- We performed inquiries of the Company's project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate  management's ability  to  achieve  the  key  cost  and  schedule  estimates,  as  well  as  evaluate  project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project.\n- We  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  key  data  used  in  developing  estimates.  We  developed independent  expectations  of  reasonable  outcomes  using,  in  part,  the  program's  data  and  compared  our expectations to management's estimates.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop  key  estimates,  including  controls  over  the  key  data  used  in  developing  the  estimates  and  the mathematical extrapolation of such data.\n- We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial  statement  impact,  including  the  appropriateness  of  the  timing  of  changes  to  key  estimates,  when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management's estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.",

The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.\n\nBDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.\n\nBDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Backlog\n\nTotal backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  MQ-25,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  A  number  of  our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reachforward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  These  programs  are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  the  loss  of  satellite  in-orbit incentive payments or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.",

      "question": "How does Emerson's retained subordinated interest in Vertiv, which generated a $453 pretax gain in fiscal 2022, reflect on the strategic rationale behind the original divestiture of the network power systems business in 2017?",
      "answer": "Emerson's retained subordinated interest in Vertiv, which resulted in a $453 pretax gain in fiscal 2022, indicates that the company structured the 2017 divestiture of its network power systems business to allow for continued upside participation if Vertiv performed well post-spinoff. This aligns with the strategic rationale of divesting a non-core business while maintaining a financial stake contingent on future success. The fact that Emerson could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 further supports a strategic intent to benefit from Vertiv\u2019s long-term value creation without operational involvement. This reflects a calculated divestiture strategy that balanced immediate liquidity with potential future gains, consistent with a broader portfolio optimization approach seen in other strategic moves like the 2022 Therm-O-Disc divestiture.",

          "chunk_text": "## INVESTMENT AND DIVESTITURE GAINS\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company sold its network power systems business (rebranded as Vertiv, now a publicly traded company, symbol VRT) in 2017 and retained a subordinated interest contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold cash return on their initial investment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the equity holders' cumulative cash return exceeded the threshold and as a result, the Company received a distribution of $438 in November 2021 (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter). Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.\n\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax, $0.72 per share). See Note 4.\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $601 in 2022, an increase of $283 compared with 2021, reflecting a charge of $145 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia ($10 of which is reported in restructuring costs), acquisition/divestiture costs of $110, higher intangibles amortization of $57, primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, and a mark-to-market loss of $50 related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTech to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price. These items were partially offset by lower restructuring costs of $64, gains from the sales of capital assets of $15, and a $14 gain from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment. The prior year also had several investment-related gains which are described below. See Notes 5 and 6.\n\nOther deductions, net were $318 in 2021, a decrease of $214 compared with 2020, reflecting lower restructuring costs of $134, investment-related gains, including gains of $21 from an investment sale and $17 from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment, and a gain of $31 from the sale of an equity investment, a favorable impact from pensions, and favorable foreign currency transactions of $17. These items were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization of $61, primarily related to the OSI acquisition.\n\n## INTEREST EXPENSE, NET\n\nInterest expense, net was $193, $154 and $156 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2022 reflects the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt in December 2021 to support the AspenTech transaction, partially offset by $500 of notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\n## EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n\nPretax earnings of $4,085 increased $1,173 in 2022, up 40 percent compared with 2021 reflecting the impact of the Vertiv and Therm-O-Disc gains discussed above. Earnings increased $401 in Automation Solutions, $19 in AspenTech and $76 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $223, largely due to the Russia business exit loss and acquisition/divestiture costs, offset by lower stock compensation expense of $80. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 18.\n\nPretax earnings of $2,912 increased $577 in 2021, up 25 percent compared with 2020. Earnings increased $416 in Automation Solutions, $9 in AspenTech and $246 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $96, reflecting higher stock compensation expense of $114 and first year acquisition accounting charges and fees related to the OSI acquisition of $50, partially offset by the investment-related gains discussed above and lower unallocated pension and postretirement costs which decreased by $41.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome taxes were $855, $585 and $345 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 21 percent, 20 percent and 15 percent in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 include benefits from restructuring subsidiaries of $11, $13 and $103, respectively. The impact on the 2022 tax rate from the gain on divestiture of the Therm-O-Disc business and the Russia business exit in 2022 essentially offset. The lower rate in 2020 included the impact of a research and development tax credit study. See Note 14.",

      "answer": "Boeing recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker program in 2021 due to factory disruption and supply chain issues, including the impact of COVID-19 and evolving customer requirements for the Remote Vision System. This loss occurred despite the program being under a fixed-price incentive fee contract, which inherently places cost overrun risk on the company. The KC-46A program had a total contract value of approximately $19 billion as of December 31, 2021, covering both the initial EMD contract and seven LRIP lots for 94 aircraft. While the contract includes incentives tied to performance, the factory disruptions and increased costs to complete the evolving system requirements have significantly affected earnings. This illustrates the financial exposure Boeing faces under fixed-price contracts when unforeseen disruptions occur, even on large, high-value programs with long-term government commitments.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Revenues\n\nBDS revenues in 2021 increased by $283 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program due to new orders for 27 aircraft received during the first quarter of 2021 and lower charges in 2021. This was partially offset by lower revenues on rotorcraft programs, Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than the prior year, largely due to the lower charges described below.\n\nBDS revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52 upgrades, proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $312 million  higher  than  the  comparable  period  in  the  prior  year,  largely  due  to  the  KC-46A Tanker  charges  during 2020.\n\n## Earnings From Operations\n\nBDS earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $5 million compared with 2020 primarily due to less unfavorable impacts from cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which improved $219 million from the prior year, largely due to lower KC-46A Tanker charges in 2021 compared to 2020 and other charges in development programs described below. The favorable change in cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was offset primarily by lower volume and mix on rotorcraft programs and lower equity earnings for United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  increased  the  reach-forward  loss  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker  program  by $402 million primarily due to continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved.  In  2020,  we  recorded  an  additional  reach-forward  loss  of  $1,320  million  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker  program reflecting $551 million of costs associated",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

Honeywell continues to believe the claims lack merit and denies wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. The Settlement Agreement remains subject to final court approval and other conditions.\n\n## GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable.\n\nOn September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates  filed  voluntary  petitions  for  relief  under  Chapter  11  of  the  United  States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31,  2020,  the  Company  reviewed  the  aggregate  carrying  value  of  the  receivable  amounts  due  in  connection  with  the  Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements.\n\nOn April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett's amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on  April  30,  2021  (the  Effective  Date),  Garrett  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  On  the  Effective  Date,  and  in  accordance  with  the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending  legal  actions  related  to  the  Garrett  Indemnity  and  Tax  Matters  Agreement,  and  (iv)  all  pending  litigation  between  the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved.\n\nThe original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provides for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $35 million in 2022  and  $100  million  per  year  from  2023  to  2030  (inclusive)  at  the  anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  unless  (i)  Garrett's consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year is less than $425 million, or (ii) Garrett does not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due will accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also includes rights which allow (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions are met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions are met.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial  redemption.  The  First  Partial  Redemption  would  be  applied  to  the  latest  scheduled  redemption  dates,  beginning  with  the shares  to  be  redeemed  in  2030.  The Amendment  also  provides  that  the  Company  cannot  exercise  its  right  to  put  the  Series  B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption does not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation.\n\nOn December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerates the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allows Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before  March  31,  2022,  such  that  the  present  value  of  remaining  outstanding  shares  of  the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  will  be $207  million  (Second  Partial  Redemption).  The  Second  Partial  Redemption  is  subject  to  similar  terms  as  the  First  Partial Redemption, including that Garrett has funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption is also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nOn December 17, 2021, Garrett  announced  their  intention  to  effect  the  First  Partial  Redemption  on  December  28,  2021,  in  the amount  of  $211  million,  and  plan  to  effect  the  Second  Partial  Redemption  during  the  first  quarter  of  2022  for  a  corresponding payment of $200 million. On December 28, 2021, Garrett paid $211 million for the amount due as the First Partial Redemption.\n\nThe Company recorded the Series B Preferred Stock at fair value at the Effective Date. The Company believes the present value of the mandatory redemptions is an appropriate basis for determining the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company's present value reflects amortized cost determined by the present value of the mandatory redemptions discounted at 7.25%, which is the rate reflected in the Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. The discount amount will accrete into interest income over the mandatory redemption period. In addition to the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company subscribed for 4.2 million shares of Garrett's Series A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into Garrett's Common Stock if certain conditions are met. Prior to and following  Garrett's  emergence  from  bankruptcy,  the  Company  also  held  2.9  million  shares  of  Garrett's  Common  Stock.  As  of December 31, 2021, Short-term investments included $34 million and Investments and long-term receivables included $423 million for the Company's investments in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\nThe Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters (including the matter described below). The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters,  as  well  as  potential  ranges  of  possible  losses  (taking  into  consideration  any  insurance  recoveries),  based  on  a  careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.\n\nSuch matters include:\n\n- Petrobras and Unaoil - The Company continues to cooperate with investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  and  the  Brazilian  authorities  relating  to  the  Company's  use  of  third  parties  who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) in connection with a  project  awarded  in  2010.  The  investigations  focus  on  compliance  with  the  U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  similar Brazilian laws (the UOP Matters), and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary's prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011. The Company continues to be engaged in discussions with the authorities with respect to a potential comprehensive resolution of these matters.\n\nAs the discussions are both ongoing and at different stages with regards to each respective authority, there can be no assurance as  to  whether  the  Company  will  reach  a  resolution  with  such  authorities  or  as  to  the  potential  timing,  terms,  or  collateral consequences of any such resolution. As a result, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these UOP Matters or the potential impact on the Company. Based on available information to date, the Company estimates that a potential comprehensive resolution of these UOP Matters would result in a probable loss of at least $160 million, and the Company has recorded a charge in this amount in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, and accrued a corresponding liability on the Consolidated Balance  Sheet. Amounts  payable  to  authorities  pursuant  to  any  potential  final  comprehensive  resolution  could  differ  from  the amount recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on available information to date, the Company does not expect that any such difference would be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position.\n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably  possible  losses  (or  a  range  of  possible  losses)  in  excess  of  current  accruals  for  such  matters.  Considering  the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.\n\n98 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How does Honeywell's accounting treatment of its investment in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock reflect the redemption terms agreed upon during Garrett's emergence from bankruptcy, and how does this impact Honeywell's long-term receivables and investment valuation?",
      "answer": "Honeywell initially accounted for its investment in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock at fair value upon Garrett's emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2021, receiving 834.8 million shares as part of the reorganization plan. The Series B Preferred Stock includes mandatory redemptions starting at $35 million in 2022 and $100 million annually from 2023 to 2030, subject to EBITDA and liquidity conditions. Subsequent amendments accelerated partial redemptions, including a $211 million payment made by Garrett on December 28, 2021, with an additional $200 million expected in Q1 2022. Honeywell applies a 7.25% discount rate to the present value of mandatory redemptions to determine fair value, which accretes into interest income over time. As of December 31, 2021, Honeywell reported $423 million in long-term receivables related to its Garrett investments, including the Series B Preferred Stock. This valuation method reflects both the contractual redemption terms and the uncertainty around future EBITDA performance and liquidity availability, directly influencing how Honeywell accounts for the investment on its balance sheet.",

An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, the  Company filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On December 7, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement (Settlement Agreement) and Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, which includes payment by Honeywell of $10 million to settle the claims in dispute. Honeywell continues to believe the claims lack merit and denies wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. The Settlement Agreement remains subject to final court approval and other conditions.\n\n## GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable.\n\nOn September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates  filed  voluntary  petitions  for  relief  under  Chapter  11  of  the  United  States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31,  2020,  the  Company  reviewed  the  aggregate  carrying  value  of  the  receivable  amounts  due  in  connection  with  the  Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements.\n\nOn April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett's amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on  April  30,  2021  (the  Effective  Date),  Garrett  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  On  the  Effective  Date,  and  in  accordance  with  the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending  legal  actions  related  to  the  Garrett  Indemnity  and  Tax  Matters  Agreement,  and  (iv)  all  pending  litigation  between  the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved.\n\nThe original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provides for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $35 million in 2022  and  $100  million  per  year  from  2023  to  2030  (inclusive)  at  the  anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  unless  (i)  Garrett's consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year is less than $425 million, or (ii) Garrett does not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due will accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also includes rights which allow (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions are met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions are met.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial  redemption.  The  First  Partial  Redemption  would  be  applied  to  the  latest  scheduled  redemption  dates,  beginning  with  the shares  to  be  redeemed  in  2030.  The Amendment  also  provides  that  the  Company  cannot  exercise  its  right  to  put  the  Series  B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption does not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation.\n\nOn December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerates the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allows Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before  March  31,  2022,  such  that  the  present  value  of  remaining  outstanding  shares  of  the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  will  be $207  million  (Second  Partial  Redemption).  The  Second  Partial  Redemption  is  subject  to  similar  terms  as  the  First  Partial Redemption, including that Garrett has funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption is also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

As  of December 31, 2021, Short-term investments included $34 million and Investments and long-term receivables included $423 million for the Company's investments in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\nThe Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters (including the matter described below). The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters,  as  well  as  potential  ranges  of  possible  losses  (taking  into  consideration  any  insurance  recoveries),  based  on  a  careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.\n\nSuch matters include:\n\n- Petrobras and Unaoil - The Company continues to cooperate with investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  and  the  Brazilian  authorities  relating  to  the  Company's  use  of  third  parties  who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) in connection with a  project  awarded  in  2010.  The  investigations  focus  on  compliance  with  the  U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  similar Brazilian laws (the UOP Matters), and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary's prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011. The Company continues to be engaged in discussions with the authorities with respect to a potential comprehensive resolution of these matters.\n\nAs the discussions are both ongoing and at different stages with regards to each respective authority, there can be no assurance as  to  whether  the  Company  will  reach  a  resolution  with  such  authorities  or  as  to  the  potential  timing,  terms,  or  collateral consequences of any such resolution. As a result, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these UOP Matters or the potential impact on the Company. Based on available information to date, the Company estimates that a potential comprehensive resolution of these UOP Matters would result in a probable loss of at least $160 million, and the Company has recorded a charge in this amount in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, and accrued a corresponding liability on the Consolidated Balance  Sheet. Amounts  payable  to  authorities  pursuant  to  any  potential  final  comprehensive  resolution  could  differ  from  the amount recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on available information to date, the Company does not expect that any such difference would be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position.\n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably  possible  losses  (or  a  range  of  possible  losses)  in  excess  of  current  accruals  for  such  matters.  Considering  the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.\n\n98 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "answer": "GE's exposure to structured settlement annuities, which carry long-duration liabilities and risks such as mortality, longevity improvements, and reinvestment in a low-interest-rate environment, is managed through its stake in Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC).

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Statutory balances reflect recognition of the estimated remaining statutory increase in reserves of approximately $3.6 billion through 2023 under the permitted accounting practice discussed further below and in Note 11 .\n\nStructured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "Emerson recognized a $453 pretax gain in fiscal 2022 from its retained subordinated interest in Vertiv, the entity to which its Network Power Systems business was rebranded and sold in 2017. The sale structure included a contingent payout mechanism, under which Emerson would only receive distributions after Vertiv\u2019s equity holders achieved a threshold cash return. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, that threshold was exceeded, triggering a $438 distribution to Emerson. Based on current projections, the company expects to receive additional distributions of approximately $75 over the next two to three years. However, these future payments are contingent on the timing and price of Vertiv share sales by the equity holders, introducing uncertainty around both the amount and timing of further gains. This financial outcome reflects a strategic divestiture that not only provided an initial exit benefit but also retained a structured upside tied to Vertiv\u2019s post-spinoff performance, aligning with Emerson\u2019s broader capital allocation and portfolio optimization strategy.",

Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.\n\nIn 2020, the Company acquired three businesses, two in the Automation Solutions segment and one in the Climate Technologies segment, for $126, net of cash acquired.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the equity holders' cumulative cash return exceeded the threshold and as a result, the Company received a distribution of $438 in November 2021 (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter). Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.\n\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax, $0.72 per share). See Note 4.\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $601 in 2022, an increase of $283 compared with 2021, reflecting a charge of $145 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia ($10 of which is reported in restructuring costs), acquisition/divestiture costs of $110, higher intangibles amortization of $57, primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, and a mark-to-market loss of $50 related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTech to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price. These items were partially offset by lower restructuring costs of $64, gains from the sales of capital assets of $15, and a $14 gain from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment. The prior year also had several investment-related gains which are described below. See Notes 5 and 6.\n\nOther deductions, net were $318 in 2021, a decrease of $214 compared with 2020, reflecting lower restructuring costs of $134, investment-related gains, including gains of $21 from an investment sale and $17 from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment, and a gain of $31 from the sale of an equity investment, a favorable impact from pensions, and favorable foreign currency transactions of $17. These items were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization of $61, primarily related to the OSI acquisition.\n\n## INTEREST EXPENSE, NET\n\nInterest expense, net was $193, $154 and $156 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2022 reflects the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt in December 2021 to support the AspenTech transaction, partially offset by $500 of notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\n## EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n\nPretax earnings of $4,085 increased $1,173 in 2022, up 40 percent compared with 2021 reflecting the impact of the Vertiv and Therm-O-Disc gains discussed above. Earnings increased $401 in Automation Solutions, $19 in AspenTech and $76 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $223, largely due to the Russia business exit loss and acquisition/divestiture costs, offset by lower stock compensation expense of $80. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 18.\n\nPretax earnings of $2,912 increased $577 in 2021, up 25 percent compared with 2020. Earnings increased $416 in Automation Solutions, $9 in AspenTech and $246 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $96, reflecting higher stock compensation expense of $114 and first year acquisition accounting charges and fees related to the OSI acquisition of $50, partially offset by the investment-related gains discussed above and lower unallocated pension and postretirement costs which decreased by $41.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome taxes were $855, $585 and $345 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 21 percent, 20 percent and 15 percent in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 include benefits from restructuring subsidiaries of $11, $13 and $103, respectively. The impact on the 2022 tax rate from the gain on divestiture of the Therm-O-Disc business and the Russia business exit in 2022 essentially offset. The lower rate in 2020 included the impact of a research and development tax credit study. See Note 14.",

      "question": "How does the $31.0 billion in trust assets associated with reinsurance contracts involving ceding insurers impact GE's reported reinsurance recoverables of $2.651 billion as of December 31, 2021, particularly in light of the trust's structure allowing ceding companies to exercise investment control over assets?",
      "answer": "GE holds approximately $31.0 billion in trust assets linked to reinsurance contracts with ceding insurers, which are structured to allow ceding companies, under certain conditions, to withdraw and manage these assets on their balance sheets, potentially influencing investment decisions. This arrangement directly affects the security and recoverability of reinsurance assets, as GE remains liable to policyholders even though recoverables are estimated in line with reserves. The reported reinsurance recoverables of $2.651 billion as of December 31, 2021, are largely secured by these trust assets, suggesting that the financial integrity and management of these trusts are critical to the realizability of the recoverables. However, the ability of ceding insurers to exert investment control introduces a layer of risk, as the value of the trust assets could fluctuate based on the ceding company's investment decisions, which may not align with GE\u2019s interests, thereby affecting the likelihood of full recovery.",

Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements.

Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024.

AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has v arious stock-based compensation plans, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units and performance stock units generally v est ov er three years. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company granted performance stock units with both a performance and serv ice condition. The performance condition relates to the attainment of predefined goals based on annual contract v alue and free cash flows. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achiev ed, if at all, and the anticipated lev el of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Option awards hav e been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally v est ov er four years and expire within sev en years or ten years of grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of v ested stock awards.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unv ested as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\n\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair v alue of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair v alue based on the serv ices that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination serv ice periods, respectiv ely. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination serv ice period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination serv ice period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements ov er the remaining requisite serv ice period.\n\n## AspenTech Stock Options\n\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option v aluation model for estimating the fair v alue of options granted. The Black-Scholes option v aluation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price v olatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, div idend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price v olatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock's historic prices ov er a period commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life of an option represents the period for which options are expected to be outstanding as determined by historic option exercises and cancellations. The risk-free",

      "answer": "UPS contributes $10 million annually to the Alaska Teamster-Employer Pension Plan, which is classified in the red zone and subject to an implemented FIP, consistent with their statement that collectively-bargained contributions satisfy FIP requirements without surcharges. This aligns with UPS's broader approach to multiemployer pension obligations, as they indicate that their contributions across all plans meet regulatory requirements and do not currently require additional surcharges or minimum contributions beyond contractual rates. The Alaska plan\u2019s red zone status and implemented FIP demonstrate how UPS manages underfunded plans through structured contributions that comply with regulatory frameworks.",

      "question": "How does GE's continued exposure to structured settlement annuities, assumed through Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company, align with the disclosed risks around longevity and reinvestment in the insurance segment analysis?",
      "answer": "GE's exposure to structured settlement annuities through Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) involves long-duration liabilities totaling $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. These annuities, primarily underwritten on impaired lives, carry significant longevity risk, as improvements in mortality could extend payment durations beyond projections. This aligns with the broader insurance segment's disclosure on page 48 that structured settlement annuities offer no ability to increase premiums or reduce benefits, making them particularly sensitive to life expectancy trends. Additionally, GE faces reinvestment risk due to a low-interest-rate environment, which could reduce investment margins needed to support these liabilities. Despite UFLIC being closed to new business since 2004, the long-duration nature of these contracts means GE must manage these risks over decades, relying on a $41.6 billion investment portfolio and future asset purchases to match liabilities. The structured settlement annuity risk profile contrasts with more flexible long-term care insurance contracts, where premium adjustments are possible, highlighting a key distinction in how GE manages different insurance liabilities.",

The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

      "question": "How does Boeing's exposure to cost overruns on fixed-price development contracts, specifically the $402 million loss recorded on the KC-46A Tanker in 2021, reconcile with the continued production authorization of 94 aircraft across seven LRIP lots valued at $19 billion as of December 31, 2021?",
      "answer": "Boeing faces significant financial exposure on fixed-price development contracts like the KC-46A Tanker, as evidenced by the $402 million loss recorded in Q4 2021 due to supply chain disruptions and evolving customer requirements. Despite these challenges, the U.S. Air Force has authorized seven LRIP lots for 94 aircraft under the same program, with a total contract value of $19 billion as of year-end 2021. This continuation suggests that while Boeing bears the risk of cost overruns inherent in fixed-price development contracts, the strategic importance of the KC-46A program and its long-term revenue potential justify ongoing production, even in the face of near-term financial losses.",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

          "chunk_text": "## Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs more fully described in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin  at  completion.  The  process  of  estimating  margin  at  completion  involves  estimating  the  costs  to  complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Fixedprice development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reachforward losses.\n\nGiven  the  complexity  of  certain  of  the  Company's  fixed-price  development  contracts,  including  the  KC-46A  Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We  evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  used  in  developing  its estimates.\n- We  evaluated  the  reasonableness  of  judgments  made  and  significant  assumptions  used  by  management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the range and probability of reasonable outcomes, and the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates.\n- We performed inquiries of the Company's project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate  management's ability  to  achieve  the  key  cost  and  schedule  estimates,  as  well  as  evaluate  project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project.\n- We  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  key  data  used  in  developing  estimates.  We  developed independent  expectations  of  reasonable  outcomes  using,  in  part,  the  program's  data  and  compared  our expectations to management's estimates.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop  key  estimates,  including  controls  over  the  key  data  used  in  developing  the  estimates  and  the mathematical extrapolation of such data.\n- We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial  statement  impact,  including  the  appropriateness  of  the  timing  of  changes  to  key  estimates,  when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management's estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.",

      "answer": "The operations overview on page 8 highlights GD's strategic focus on submarine production, particularly the Columbia-class and Virginia-class programs, while also noting the ongoing construction of the John Lewis-class (T-AO-205) fleet replenishment oiler as part of NASSCO\u2019s portfolio. It states that seven T-AO-205 ships are in backlog with deliveries planned into 2028, indicating a long-term commitment to this surface ship program. On page 43, the $735 million contract awarded in 2023 for an additional John Lewis-class vessel underscores the Navy\u2019s continued investment in this program and GD\u2019s role in executing it. This contract is one of the larger awards in the Marine Systems segment that year, suggesting GD is balancing its strategic focus on submarines with sustained execution on surface ship programs. The combination of long-term backlog and new contract awards indicates that GD is maintaining capacity and prioritization across both domains.",

      "question": "How does Boeing's accounting treatment of lease options in its property and equipment disclosures reconcile with its provision of customer financing that includes similar lease extension and termination options, particularly in light of the credit risk exposure highlighted in Boeing Capital's portfolio analysis?",
      "answer": "Boeing accounts for lease options in its property and equipment disclosures by incorporating them into the calculation of lease assets and liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised, using its incremental borrowing rate to determine present value (page 78). In the customer financing section, Boeing Capital discloses that its financing arrangements often include options to extend or terminate leases, which are structurally similar to the lease options recognized in the accounting policy (page 93). However, in the Boeing Capital portfolio analysis (page 47), the company acknowledges significant credit risk exposure due to customer liquidity issues, including $398 million in charges for expected credit losses in 2020. This creates a tension: while the accounting policy assumes certainty in lease option exercise for asset valuation purposes, the operational reality in the Boeing Capital section shows that customer financial instability can undermine the realizability of those lease terms. Therefore, the accounting treatment assumes operational continuity, while the credit risk disclosures highlight the financial risk that contradicts that assumption.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation  and  are  depreciated  principally  over  the  following  estimated  useful  lives:  new  buildings  and  land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years' digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line  method  over  the  term  of  the  hosting  arrangement,  which  is  typically  no  greater  than  10  years.  We  periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.\n\nLong-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.\n\nLeases We determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at the inception date. Operating leases are included in Other  assets,  with  the  related  liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under finance leases, which primarily represent computer equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the  related  liabilities  included  in  Short-term  debt  and  current  portion  of  long-term  debt  and  Long-term  debt  on  the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Variable components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have real property lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe  record  all  known  asset  retirement  obligations  for  which  the  liability's  fair  value  can  be  reasonably  estimated, including  certain  asbestos  removal,  asset  decommissioning  and  contractual  lease  restoration  obligations.  Recorded amounts are not material.\n\nWe  also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset decommissioning  activities  to  be  performed  in  the  future,  that  are  not  reasonably  estimable  due  to  insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the  liability's  fair  value.  In  addition,  there  may  be  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations  that  we  have  not  yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of",

The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was $101 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year .\n\n## Earnings From Operations\n\nBGS earnings  from  operations  in  2021  increased  by  $1,567  million  compared  with  2020,  primarily  due  to  charges incurred in 2020 driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher commercial services volume in 2021, partially offset by an inventory write-down of $220 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by revised cost estimates on certain customer contracts. Charges in 2020 included $531 million of inventory write-downs, $178 million of related impairments of distribution rights primarily driven by airlines' decisions to retire certain aircraft, $398 million for higher expected credit losses primarily driven by customer liquidity issues, $115 million of contract termination and facility impairment charges, and $72 million of severance costs. The net favorable impact of cumulative contract catchup adjustments in 2021 was $98 million lower than the prior year .\n\nBGS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $2,247  million  compared  with  2019,  primarily  due  to  lower commercial services revenue as well as the 2020 earnings charges described in the previous paragraph. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was consistent with the prior year .\n\n## Backlog\n\nBGS total backlog of $20,496 million at December 31, 2021 decreased by 1% from $20,632 million at December 31, 2020, primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.\n\n## Boeing Capital\n\n## Business Environment and Trends\n\nBCC's gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 totaled $1,734 million. A substantial portion of BCC's portfolio is composed of customers that have less than investment-grade credit. BCC's portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.\n\nBCC provided customer financing of $14 million during 2020 and none during 2021. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2021 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.\n\nAircraft  values  and  lease  rates  are  impacted  by  the  number  and  type  of  aircraft  that  are  currently  out  of  service. Approximately 5,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft (20.5% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2021, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, a larger portion are expected to be retired compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, which directly impacts the Company in terms of number of new aircraft deliveries and financing opportunities, the ability of existing customers to meet current payment obligations and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2020 and 2019, 29.4% and 8.5% of the western-built commercial jet  aircraft  were  parked. Aircraft  valuations  could decline  if  significant  numbers  of  additional  aircraft,  particularly  types  with  relatively  few  operators,  are  placed  out  of service.

      "question": "How does UPS's use of net asset value (NAV) to measure certain alternative investments align with the liquidity constraints and unfunded commitments associated with their private debt investments?",
      "answer": "UPS utilizes NAV as a practical expedient to value alternative investments like private debt, which reflects the most recent partnership audited financial reports and is adjusted for investment activity (page 94). This valuation approach is necessary due to the lack of readily determinable fair value for these assets. On page 93, UPS discloses that their private debt investments are part of limited partnerships with terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, and as of December 31, 2024, they have $2.7 billion in unfunded commitments expected to be contributed over the next three to six years. These liquidity constraints and long-term commitments highlight the practical limitations of valuing such investments through traditional fair value methods, reinforcing the rationale for using NAV. However, the lack of immediate liquidity and potential valuation discrepancies due to market opacity underscore the risks associated with relying on NAV for these private debt instruments.",

      "answer": "GE's structured settlement annuities, which include 27% impaired life underwriting, expose the company to significant longevity risk because these contracts involve life-contingent payments that may extend beyond current actuarial estimates. These contracts are reinsured through UFLIC, which has not accepted new business since 2004 and is part of GE\u2019s run-off insurance operations. Given UFLIC's closed status, GE cannot offset this risk by acquiring new, potentially more favorable policies. This creates a static risk profile for GE, where the long-term liabilities tied to these life-contingent contracts must be managed without the ability to diversify or expand the portfolio. The combination of impaired life underwriting and the inability to add new policies increases the potential for reserve volatility and financial exposure over time.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits.

The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "question": "How does FedEx's reliance on maintaining service commitments to customers, particularly in light of potential reductions in reliance by the USPS on its air network, interact with the competitive pressures from other U.S. delivery providers like the USPS itself, and what financial implications could this have given FedEx\u2019s long-lived asset strategy outlined in its 10-K?",
      "answer": "FedEx's ability to maintain service commitments is central to its brand value and customer trust, but this is threatened by potential strategic shifts by the USPS to reduce its reliance on FedEx Express\u2019s air network, which negatively impacted FedEx\u2019s 2022 results. The USPS is FedEx Express\u2019s largest customer, and any further reduction in volume or early termination of the contract\u2014set to expire in September 2024\u2014could significantly affect FedEx\u2019s profitability. At the same time, FedEx faces intense competition in the U.S. from entities like UPS, regional delivery firms, and the USPS itself, which could further strain its ability to meet service commitments if demand shifts or pricing pressure increases. Given that FedEx\u2019s business is capital-intensive (with 55% of owned assets in transportation and IT infrastructure), and that aircraft are depreciated over 15\u201330 years with little to no salvage value, any sustained reduction in volume\u2014such as from a major customer like the USPS\u2014could lead to underutilized assets, increased depreciation costs, and potential impairments. This combination of customer risk and competitive pressure introduces significant financial risk, especially as FedEx\u2019s asset utilization strategy depends on high network throughput to justify its capital investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [FDX](page_69) \u2192 [Service Commitments]: FedEx emphasizes the importance of maintaining service commitments, noting that aircraft are used interchangeably across routes and geographies to ensure delivery reliability, which is essential for customer satisfaction.",
        "Hop 2: [Service Commitments] \u2192 [USPS]: The USPS is FedEx Express\u2019s largest customer, and its strategic moves to reduce reliance on FedEx\u2019s air network have already negatively impacted FedEx\u2019s results, threatening the company\u2019s ability to maintain consistent service levels and profitability.",
        "Hop 3: [USPS] \u2190 [FDX](page_16): FedEx competes with the USPS in the U.S. express delivery market, and the USPS\u2019s dual role as both a major customer and a competitor introduces a complex dynamic where FedEx must balance service obligations with competitive exposure."

Our business is capital intensive, with approximately 55% of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures.\n\nThe depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. These evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment.\n\nFor our aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the useful lives and expected salvage values. We typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations (as described below). Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes, and other factors beyond our control.\n\nIMPAIRMENT. As of May 31, 2022, the FedEx Express global air network included a fleet of 696 aircraft (including approximately 300 supplemental aircraft) that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of U.S. and international shipping services. While certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas (U.S. versus international), we operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers. Because of the integrated nature of our global network, our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed.",

As technology, customer behavior, and market conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. If we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, our future financial results will suffer. For additional discussion, see 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Strategy.'\n\nWe may not be able to achieve our fiscal 2025 financial performance goals. In June 2022, we announced that FedEx is targeting certain financial performance goals for fiscal 2025. Our ability to achieve these goals is dependent on a number of factors, including the other risk factors described in this section. If we are not able to achieve these goals, the price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\n\nWe depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand. The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability, and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing and recruitment tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us; low service or safety levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; or our executive compensation practices could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers and team members. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\n\nChanges in the business or financial soundness of the USPS, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of FedEx Express, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The USPS is the largest customer of FedEx Express, which provides domestic air transportation services for the USPS's First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail and transportation and delivery for the USPS's international delivery service. See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under 'FedEx Express Segment' for more information.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations. The USPS is currently implementing strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air networks of FedEx Express and other transportation providers, which negatively impacted our results of operations in 2022. The difficulties discussed above or additional changes in the USPS's business, including its ability to access capital or any structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service commitments, or pricing, could have additional negative impacts on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, a decision by the USPS to terminate early or not renew its contract with FedEx Express for domestic services, which expires in September 2024, would negatively impact our profitability.\n\nWe face intense competition. The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report for additional information.",

Risk Factors' of this Annual Report, the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer's overall supply chain.\n\nCompetitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. ('UPS'), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. FedEx Express's principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France's La Poste's GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. FedEx Express also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of FedEx Express's international competitors are government-owned, controlled, or            -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express. For more information, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Employees\n\nDonald F. Colleran is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. Mr. Colleran will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer through August 31, 2022 and remain at FedEx Express as FedEx Express CEO Executive Advisor until his retirement on December 31, 2022. Richard W. Smith, who previously served as Regional President, The Americas and Executive Vice President, Global Support of FedEx Express, was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer-Elect of FedEx Express effective April 1, 2022, and will succeed Mr. Colleran as President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express effective September 1, 2022. As of May 31, 2022, FedEx Express employed approximately 191,000 permanent full-time and approximately 58,000 permanent part-time employees.\n\nThe pilots of FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International ('ALPA') and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021 and continues. In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, certain of FedEx Express's non-U.S. employees are unionized. In June 2022, the Transport Workers Union filed an application with the National Mediation Board requesting an election to represent approximately 130 Global Operations Control ('GOC') specialists who perform flight dispatching functions in FedEx Express's GOC center. FedEx Express has raised objections to the application in its response. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n## FedEx Custom Critical\n\nFedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited, time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Among its services are Surface Expedite, providing exclusive-use shipping and time-definite services; Air Expedite, offering an array of expedited air solutions to meet customers' critical delivery times; and White Glove Services, for shipments that require extra care in handling, temperature control, or specialized security.

      "answer": "GE faces potential future capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries, including UFLIC, due to statutory reserve testing that depends on assumptions like discount rates and morbidity trends. This risk is compounded by the fact that UFLIC holds $31,800 million in assets under reinsurance contracts in trust accounts, which are subject to withdrawal by ceding insurers under certain conditions. If ceding companies exercise investment control over these assets, it could reduce UFLIC\u2019s liquidity and increase GE\u2019s exposure to funding shortfalls, especially if statutory reserve requirements rise.

      "answer": "GE plans to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 to support its run-off insurance liabilities, which are managed under strict investment guidelines aimed at maintaining credit quality, yield, liquidity, and diversification. These assets, including traditional and non-traditional investments, are intended to support insurance obligations and are subject to regulatory and risk-based capital constraints. Meanwhile, approximately $31.0 billion of assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts, where investment decisions may be influenced by ceding companies under certain trust agreements. Some of these agreements allow ceding companies to withdraw trust assets and exercise investment control over them, which could affect the alignment between GE\u2019s planned asset strategy and the actual risk exposure of the trust assets backing reinsurance obligations. This dynamic introduces complexity in ensuring that the investment strategy aligns with the risk management framework across both owned and ceded reinsurance assets.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Statutory balances reflect recognition of the estimated remaining statutory increase in reserves of approximately $3.6 billion through 2023 under the permitted accounting practice discussed further below and in Note 11 .\n\nStructured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

          "chunk_text": "Our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either ERAC or UFLIC as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

      "question": "How does Boeing's disclosure of customer financing balances with embedded purchase options impact balance sheet quality when compared to its treatment of finance leases in property, plant and equipment, given both arrangements contain similar purchase option language?",
      "answer": "Boeing's customer financing arrangements (primarily in the BCC segment) include provisions allowing lessees to purchase underlying aircraft at specified prices, with balances totaling $390 million in accounts receivable and $186 million in other assets at December 31, 2021. These customer financing arrangements explicitly contain purchase options similar to those found in Boeing's internal finance leases. In the property & equipment section, Boeing states that assets under finance leases (primarily computer equipment) are included in Property, Plant and Equipment at cost, with related liabilities in debt categories. This creates a contrast in balance sheet treatment: customer financing receivables with purchase options remain off-BPE and are classified as receivables, while Boeing's own finance leases with similar option structures result in asset inclusion on the balance sheet. This differential treatment affects balance sheet quality metrics by keeping customer financing risks in receivables rather than capitalizing potential future asset returns or residual value exposures.",

The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years' digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line  method  over  the  term  of  the  hosting  arrangement,  which  is  typically  no  greater  than  10  years.  We  periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.\n\nLong-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.\n\nLeases We determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at the inception date. Operating leases are included in Other  assets,  with  the  related  liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under finance leases, which primarily represent computer equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the  related  liabilities  included  in  Short-term  debt  and  current  portion  of  long-term  debt  and  Long-term  debt  on  the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Variable components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have real property lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe  record  all  known  asset  retirement  obligations  for  which  the  liability's  fair  value  can  be  reasonably  estimated, including  certain  asbestos  removal,  asset  decommissioning  and  contractual  lease  restoration  obligations.  Recorded amounts are not material.\n\nWe  also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset decommissioning  activities  to  be  performed  in  the  future,  that  are  not  reasonably  estimable  due  to  insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the  liability's  fair  value.  In  addition,  there  may  be  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations  that  we  have  not  yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of",

      "answer": "Honeywell initially wrote down $509 million in receivables from Garrett in 2020 due to the uncertainty surrounding the enforceability of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement. Following Garrett's emergence from bankruptcy in April 2021, Honeywell received 834.8 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock as part of the settlement, which included mandatory redemption terms starting with $35 million in 2022 and $100 million annually from 2023 to 2030, subject to Garrett's EBITDA and liquidity conditions. By December 2021, the redemption schedule was accelerated and amended, reducing the present value of the Series B Preferred Stock to $207 million. The fair value of this investment, as disclosed on page 90, is based on the present value of these mandatory redemptions and is classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. This implies that Honeywell adjusted its recovery expectations downward from the original redemption schedule due to the increased risk of non-payment, reflected in both the write-down and the updated fair value estimate.",

An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, the  Company filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On December 7, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement (Settlement Agreement) and Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, which includes payment by Honeywell of $10 million to settle the claims in dispute. Honeywell continues to believe the claims lack merit and denies wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. The Settlement Agreement remains subject to final court approval and other conditions.\n\n## GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable.\n\nOn September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates  filed  voluntary  petitions  for  relief  under  Chapter  11  of  the  United  States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31,  2020,  the  Company  reviewed  the  aggregate  carrying  value  of  the  receivable  amounts  due  in  connection  with  the  Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements.\n\nOn April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett's amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on  April  30,  2021  (the  Effective  Date),  Garrett  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  On  the  Effective  Date,  and  in  accordance  with  the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending  legal  actions  related  to  the  Garrett  Indemnity  and  Tax  Matters  Agreement,  and  (iv)  all  pending  litigation  between  the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved.\n\nThe original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provides for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $35 million in 2022  and  $100  million  per  year  from  2023  to  2030  (inclusive)  at  the  anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  unless  (i)  Garrett's consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year is less than $425 million, or (ii) Garrett does not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due will accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also includes rights which allow (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions are met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions are met.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial  redemption.  The  First  Partial  Redemption  would  be  applied  to  the  latest  scheduled  redemption  dates,  beginning  with  the shares  to  be  redeemed  in  2030.  The Amendment  also  provides  that  the  Company  cannot  exercise  its  right  to  put  the  Series  B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption does not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation.\n\nOn December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerates the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allows Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before  March  31,  2022,  such  that  the  present  value  of  remaining  outstanding  shares  of  the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  will  be $207  million  (Second  Partial  Redemption).  The  Second  Partial  Redemption  is  subject  to  similar  terms  as  the  First  Partial Redemption, including that Garrett has funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption is also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How does MMM's retained equity interest in Solventum, which it intends to divest within five years, influence its ongoing exposure to PFAS-related liabilities that are specifically allocated to Solventum for actions taken after April 1, 2024, particularly in light of the company's retained obligations for legacy PFAS liabilities and its recent defense verdicts in respirator mask litigation?",
      "answer": "MMM retains an equity interest in Solventum following the spin-off and intends to divest it within five years, though the timing and proceeds from such a divestiture are uncertain. Despite this planned divestiture, MMM remains exposed to PFAS-related liabilities that are specifically allocated to Solventum for actions taken after April 1, 2024, if those actions involve failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid contamination. This retained exposure contrasts with MMM\u2019s broader strategy to reduce complexity and risk by spinning off Solventum. Meanwhile, MMM also retains direct liability for legacy PFAS contamination and product claims tied to pre-April 2024 activities, including those under a settlement agreement with U.S. public water systems. Despite recent defense verdicts in respirator mask litigation, which MMM cites as evidence of product efficacy, the company acknowledges that future claims\u2014particularly those involving serious injuries\u2014will be more costly to resolve. Thus, MMM\u2019s ongoing financial and legal exposure to PFAS liabilities is shaped not only by its historical operations but also by its continued partial ownership of Solventum during the transition period.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFollowing the separation, the Company is a smaller, less diversified company than it was prior to the separation, which could make the Company more vulnerable to factors impacting its performance, such as changing market conditions and market volatility. In addition, the Company may be unable to find suitable alternatives for goods and services that Solventum temporarily provides to the Company pursuant to the agreements noted above, or such alternative goods and services may be more expensive than provided by Solventum to the Company.\n\nThe Company retained an equity interest in Solventum in connection with the spin-off. The Company cannot predict the trading price of shares of Solventum's common stock and the market value of the Solventum shares is subject to market volatility and other factors outside of the Company's control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Solventum within five years from the spin-off, but there can be no assurance regarding the timing of, or timeframe over which, such divestiture or divestitures may occur, or the amount of proceeds received by the Company in connection with any such divestitures.\n\nIn addition, while it is intended that the transaction be tax -free to the Company's stockholders for U.S. federal income tax  purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off is ultimately determined to be tax able, the Company, Solventum, or the Company's stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nThe Company has processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. These processes are integrated into the Company's overall risk management systems, as overseen by the Company's board of directors, primarily through its audit committee. These processes also include overseeing and identifying risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers. The Company conducts security assessments of certain third-party providers before engagement and has established monitoring procedures in its effort to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third parties. The Company from time to time engages third-party consultants, legal advisors, and audit firms in evaluating and testing the Company's risk management systems and assessing and remediating certain cybersecurity incidents. The Company also continues to provide its employees with cybersecurity and data protection training to support its risk mitigation efforts.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe audit committee of the Company's board of directors oversees, among other things, the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal controls, including internal controls designed to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The audit committee is informed of material risks from cybersecurity threats pursuant to the escalation criteria as set forth in the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Further, at least once per quarter, the Company's Chief Information and Digital Officer ('CIDO'), and/or the Company's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), reports on cybersecurity matters, including material risks and threats, to the Company's audit committee, and the audit committee provides updates to the Company's board of directors at regular board meetings. The CIDO also provides updates annually or more frequently as appropriate to the Company's board of directors.\n\n## Management\n\nUnder the oversight of the audit committee of the Company's board of directors, and as directed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the CIDO and CISO are primarily responsible for the assessment and management of material cybersecurity risks. The CIDO has more than two decades of experience with global technology organizations across multiple industries. The CISO has over 25 years of experience in information security, risk management, and compliance, has served as the chief information security officer at other organizations and, among other things, is a certified information systems security professional. The CIDO and CISO are also supported by a Cybersecurity &amp; Privacy Executive Oversight Committee, which is comprised of certain members of senior management and is provides crossfunctional support for cybersecurity risk management and facilitates the response to any cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe Company's CISO oversees the Company's cybersecurity incident response plan and related processes that are designed to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO also coordinates with the Company's legal counsel and third parties, such as consultants and legal advisors, to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents pursuant to criteria set forth in the Company's incident response plan and related processes.",

The Company will retain liabilities related to site-based PFAS contamination at any real property owned, leased or operated by the Company and liabilities for site-based PFAS contamination arising from third-party claims at sites allocated to the Solventum group in the separation to the extent such liabilities relate to PFAS contamination existing at or prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum assumes PFAS liabilities from the Solventum sites to the extent resulting from an action taken by any member of the Solventum group following April 1, 2024, or from any failure by Solventum following April 1, 2024, to use commercially reasonable efforts that are consistent with then-current industry standards to avoid contamination. The Company will also retain PFAS liabilities for product claims (x) arising from the Company's products, (y) arising from Solventum's products sold prior to April 1, 2024, and (z) arising from certain products sold by Solventum at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to the ex ceptions described below).

Solventum will be responsible for the maintenance of certain PFAS containment measures at its properties after the effective time of the distribution. In addition, and consistent with the allocation described above, the Company will retain specifically identified PFAS-related liabilities, including those resulting from specified PFAS-related litigation matters and liabilities under the Company's settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States, as described below.\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance recoveries the Company has recorded relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation: As of December 31, 2024, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 3,500 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,042 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company's mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n\nThe Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, is expected to represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in nineteen of the twenty cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below) and, in the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended two respirator product liability trials. In February 2024, a jury in Kentucky delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M's 8710 and 8210 respirators that the plaintiff claimed to have used were not defective. In April 2024, another jury in Kentucky returned a defense verdict in 3M's favor and concluded that 3M's 8710 respirator that the plaintiff claimed to have used was not defective.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to litigate and resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it ex perienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.",

The development and use of artificial intelligence may present risks to the Company's business. Also, the rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment relating to artificial intelligence, in the United States and internationally, could impact the Company's implementation of artificial intelligence technology, and increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. While the Company will seek to develop and use artificial intelligence responsibly, and will attempt to identify and mitigate ethical, privacy, legal or other issues presented by its use, there can be no assurance that the Company will be fully successful in doing so, and may be subject to data breaches, allegations of unauthorized access to, or use of, third party data, information, or intellectual property rights, or other risks, which may lead to financial losses, legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage.\n\nThe failure to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations could result in significant civil fines and penalties or criminal sanctions against the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. These laws and regulations prohibit corrupt payments by the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents. The Company is also required to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls under the FCPA's accounting provisions. From time to time, the Company receives reports internally and externally, via various reporting channels deployed by its Ethics and Compliance function or otherwise (such as shareholder communications), about business and other activities that raise compliance or other legal or litigation issues. The Company has in the past, and in the future could be, required to investigate such reports and cooperate with U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities in such investigations, audit, monitor compliance or alter its practices as part of such investigations, and the Company has in the past and may in the future be required to pay fines or penalties related to its practices. While the Company maintains and implements U.S. and international compliance programs, including policies and procedures, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of noncompliance, the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents may violate such policies and procedures and engage in practices that contravene relevant laws and regulations.\n\nThe Company's results of operations could experience a material adverse effect if the costs to comply with these evolving treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are greater than projected by the Company. In addition, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are difficult to reliably predict, may differ from the Company's ex pectations, and have resulted and may in the future result in, one or more of the following: criminal or civil sanctions, including fines; limitations on the ex tent to which the Company can conduct business; employee and business partner terminations due to policy violations; and private rights of action that result in litigation ex posure, including ex penses and costs incurred in connection with settlement or court proceedings, for the Company. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of these acts is ex pensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance to mitigate monetary exposure, the amount of the liability that may result from certain of these risks is unlikely to be fully covered by applicable insurance, and to the ex tent covered, will ex ceed the applicable limits of such insurance. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows or its consolidated financial position. In addition, negative publicity related to the matters noted above or other matters involving the Company may negatively impact the Company's reputation. The Company also relies on patent and other intellectual property protection, and challenges to the Company's intellectual property rights, or claims that the Company's activities interfere with the intellectual property rights of a third party, could cause the Company to incur significant expenses to assert or defend against such claims, could result in reduced revenue, and could damage the Company's reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of those compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of those compounds by the end of 2008. The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter-chainlength PFAS compounds. These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company's policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3M's current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions with respect to PFAS: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M is progressing toward the exit of all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. The Company continues to discuss its PFAS manufacturing exit, and related issues involving the disposition of manufacturing assets, with customers, government authorities, and other stakeholders, and the Company remains focused on completing the exit in a timely and orderly fashion.\n\n3M is also working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025 and has made progress in eliminating the use of PFAS across its product portfolio in a variety of applications. With respect to PFAS-containing products not manufactured by 3M in the Company's supply chains, the Company continues to evaluate the availability and feasibility of third-party products that do not contain PFAS. Depending on the availability and feasibility of such thirdparty products not containing PFAS, the Company continues to evaluate circumstances in which the use of PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties and used in certain applications in 3M's product portfolios, such as lithium ion batteries, printed circuit boards and certain seals and gaskets, all widely used in commerce across a variety of industries, and in some cases required by regulatory or industry standards, may or are expected to, depending on applications, continue beyond 2025.

These activities include gathering of ex posure and use information, risk assessment activities, and increasingly stringent restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions and environmental media, in some cases moving towards presently non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulatory limits for PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are being set at increasingly low levels. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS, including PFAS compounds manufactured by 3M, used in current 3M products or generated as byproducts or degradation products from certain 3M production processes. Finally, in certain jurisdictions, legislation is being considered that, if enacted, might authorize the recovery from individuals or entities costs alleged to have been imposed on the jurisdiction's healthcare system, as well as related costs.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\")), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate (\"PFOA\"), perfluorooctane sulfonate (\"PFOS\"), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (\"PFHxS\"), perfluorobutane sulfonate (\"PFBS\"), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (\"HFPO-DA\") and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively, \"PFAS\").\n\nAs a result of a phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and their precursor compounds. The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of those compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of those compounds by the end of 2008. The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter-chainlength PFAS compounds. These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company's policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3M's current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions with respect to PFAS: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M is progressing toward the exit of all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. The Company continues to discuss its PFAS manufacturing exit, and related issues involving the disposition of manufacturing assets, with customers, government authorities, and other stakeholders, and the Company remains focused on completing the exit in a timely and orderly fashion.\n\n3M is also working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025 and has made progress in eliminating the use of PFAS across its product portfolio in a variety of applications. With respect to PFAS-containing products not manufactured by 3M in the Company's supply chains, the Company continues to evaluate the availability and feasibility of third-party products that do not contain PFAS. Depending on the availability and feasibility of such thirdparty products not containing PFAS, the Company continues to evaluate circumstances in which the use of PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties and used in certain applications in 3M's product portfolios, such as lithium ion batteries, printed circuit boards and certain seals and gaskets, all widely used in commerce across a variety of industries, and in some cases required by regulatory or industry standards, may or are expected to, depending on applications, continue beyond 2025. In other cases, sales of products manufactured before the end of 2025, regulatory approval, or customer re-certification or re-qualification of substitutes or replacements to eliminate the use of PFAS manufactured by third parties may not be completed, or, depending on circumstances, are not expected to be completed, by the end of 2025. With respect to PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties, the Company intends to continue to evaluate beyond the end of 2025 the adoption of third-party products that do not contain PFAS to the extent such products are available and such adoption is feasible.\n\n## PFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\n\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies.

      "answer": "Emerson's performance share expenses increased significantly from $89 million in fiscal 2022 to $165 million in fiscal 2023. This increase coincides with AspenTech's revenue contribution, which rose from $1 million in fiscal 2022 to $8 million in fiscal 2023. The connection between these figures is further supported by the disclosure that AspenTech has its own stock-based compensation plans, including performance shares, which are now included in Emerson's consolidated financial statements. This suggests that AspenTech's integration contributed to the rise in performance share expenses.",

These financial impacts reflect the acquisition's cost and integration expenses. Meanwhile, the Test & Measurement segment, which now includes National Instruments, is strategically positioned as a provider of software-connected automated test and measurement systems aimed at accelerating product development and reducing costs for enterprises.

      "answer": "FedEx's exposure to reductions in USPS service commitments\u2014specifically the strategic shift by USPS to reduce reliance on FedEx Express's air network\u2014poses a risk to FedEx's revenue and profitability as noted in the risk factors. This risk is directly tied to FedEx's asset strategy, where 55% of owned assets are invested in transportation infrastructure, including a global air fleet of 696 aircraft. FedEx's depreciation policy for aircraft, which assumes little to no salvage value due to cargo configuration wear, is sensitive to changes in business levels and utilization. Given that FedEx operates an integrated global network where aircraft are interchangeable to maintain service commitments, a reduction in USPS volume could force underutilization of aircraft, accelerating depreciation or impairments, and impacting the company's ability to align fleet size with demand while maintaining flexibility across geographies.",

Our business is capital intensive, with approximately 55% of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures.\n\nThe depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. These evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment.\n\nFor our aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the useful lives and expected salvage values. We typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations (as described below). Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes, and other factors beyond our control.\n\nIMPAIRMENT. As of May 31, 2022, the FedEx Express global air network included a fleet of 696 aircraft (including approximately 300 supplemental aircraft) that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of U.S. and international shipping services. While certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas (U.S. versus international), we operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers. Because of the integrated nature of our global network, our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed.",

The operational risk section highlights that product failures or execution issues can lead to warranty costs, reputational damage, and financial penalties.

      "answer": "Emerson reported in 2022 that AspenTech's earnings contribution dropped to $0 (page 59), which contrasts with the strategic positioning of AspenTech as a core provider of asset optimization software within Emerson\u2019s digital ecosystem. On page 76, AspenTech is described as a global leader in asset optimization software that enables industrial manufacturers to enhance performance through modeling, simulation, and optimization. This suggests that AspenTech was expected to be a strategic asset contributing to both operational efficiency and sustainability. However, the financial data indicates that AspenTech did not contribute earnings in 2022, raising questions about its integration or market performance relative to its stated strategic importance. This discrepancy highlights a potential misalignment between AspenTech\u2019s expected value proposition and its financial contribution during the period.",

      "answer": "Boeing's increasing reach-forward loss on the Commercial Crew program by $185 million in 2021, as detailed in the operational performance section, reflects the financial volatility inherent in fixed-price development contracts. This aligns with the broader risk profile outlined in the financial statement notes, which emphasize the uncertainty in cost estimation and the potential for material charges due to technical complexity and delays. The $402 million additional loss recorded on the KC-46A Tanker contract in the same year further illustrates the recurring financial exposure Boeing faces under such contracts, particularly when unforeseen disruptions like supply chain delays or evolving customer requirements occur. Together, these examples highlight how Boeing's financial performance is significantly impacted by the execution risks tied to fixed-price development programs.",

The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.\n\nBDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.\n\nBDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Backlog\n\nTotal backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  MQ-25,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  A  number  of  our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reachforward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  These  programs  are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  the  loss  of  satellite  in-orbit incentive payments or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.",

          "chunk_text": "## Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs more fully described in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin  at  completion.  The  process  of  estimating  margin  at  completion  involves  estimating  the  costs  to  complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Fixedprice development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reachforward losses.\n\nGiven  the  complexity  of  certain  of  the  Company's  fixed-price  development  contracts,  including  the  KC-46A  Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We  evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  used  in  developing  its estimates.\n- We  evaluated  the  reasonableness  of  judgments  made  and  significant  assumptions  used  by  management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the range and probability of reasonable outcomes, and the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates.\n- We performed inquiries of the Company's project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate  management's ability  to  achieve  the  key  cost  and  schedule  estimates,  as  well  as  evaluate  project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project.\n- We  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  key  data  used  in  developing  estimates.  We  developed independent  expectations  of  reasonable  outcomes  using,  in  part,  the  program's  data  and  compared  our expectations to management's estimates.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop  key  estimates,  including  controls  over  the  key  data  used  in  developing  the  estimates  and  the mathematical extrapolation of such data.\n- We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial  statement  impact,  including  the  appropriateness  of  the  timing  of  changes  to  key  estimates,  when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management's estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

      "answer": "MMM retains PFAS-related product liability claims for Solventum's products sold between April 1, 2024, and January 1, 2026, unless they fall under specific exceptions such as new products introduced by Solventum or modifications made after April 1, 2024. However, MMM\u2019s accounting policy states that it only records liabilities when the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding PFAS litigation, including the potential for indeterminate damages and long resolution timelines, MMM may not immediately recognize liabilities for these retained claims, even though they remain legally obligated. This creates a risk of future charges that could materially exceed current accruals, impacting MMM's financial position and results of operations.",

Solventum will retain liability for all PFAS-related liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of its business at or after April 1, 2024, other than liabilities from product claims alleging harm from the presence of PFAS in certain products of Solventum's business sold at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to ex ceptions described in further detail below). The Company will retain liabilities related to site-based PFAS contamination at any real property owned, leased or operated by the Company and liabilities for site-based PFAS contamination arising from third-party claims at sites allocated to the Solventum group in the separation to the extent such liabilities relate to PFAS contamination existing at or prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum assumes PFAS liabilities from the Solventum sites to the extent resulting from an action taken by any member of the Solventum group following April 1, 2024, or from any failure by Solventum following April 1, 2024, to use commercially reasonable efforts that are consistent with then-current industry standards to avoid contamination. The Company will also retain PFAS liabilities for product claims (x) arising from the Company's products, (y) arising from Solventum's products sold prior to April 1, 2024, and (z) arising from certain products sold by Solventum at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to the ex ceptions described below).

Solventum will be responsible for the maintenance of certain PFAS containment measures at its properties after the effective time of the distribution. In addition, and consistent with the allocation described above, the Company will retain specifically identified PFAS-related liabilities, including those resulting from specified PFAS-related litigation matters and liabilities under the Company's settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States, as described below.\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance recoveries the Company has recorded relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation: As of December 31, 2024, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 3,500 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,042 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company's mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n\nThe Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, is expected to represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in nineteen of the twenty cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below) and, in the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended two respirator product liability trials. In February 2024, a jury in Kentucky delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M's 8710 and 8210 respirators that the plaintiff claimed to have used were not defective. In April 2024, another jury in Kentucky returned a defense verdict in 3M's favor and concluded that 3M's 8710 respirator that the plaintiff claimed to have used was not defective.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to litigate and resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it ex perienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.",

The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on ex perience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably estimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings, and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\n\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in ex cess of presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters for which no accruals are currently recorded, because losses are not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages, or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions, that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages, but with which the Company may not agree. Such information may or may not lead the Company to determine that it is able to make a reasonable estimate as to a probable loss or range of loss in connection with a matter. However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, future adverse rulings or developments, or settlements in, one or more matters could result in future changes to determinations of probable and reasonably estimable losses in other matters.\n\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings: The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their ex clusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its ex perience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company's insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an ex pense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\n\nImpact of Solventum Spin-Off : On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its Health Care business as an independent company known as Solventum. Concurrent with the spin-off, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements, including transition agreements and a separation and distribution agreement that, among other things, identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, indemnification and defense obligations, and the contracts to be transferred to Solventum and 3M as part of the spin-off. In general, and except as noted below and as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, certain liabilities related to Solventum or the assets that are transferred to Solventum in connection with the spin-off will be retained by or transferred to Solventum. For example, potential liabilities associated with the matters previously described in prior filings under the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation sections of this Note 19 have been assumed by Solventum pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, and Solventum will indemnify and defend the Company in these actions.",

      "question": "How does Emerson's acquisition of National Instruments for $8.2 billion align with its broader portfolio transformation strategy, particularly considering the subsequent divestiture of its 40% stake in Copeland for $1.5 billion and a note receivable for $1.9 billion?",
      "answer": "Emerson's acquisition of National Instruments for $8.2 billion aligns with its broader portfolio transformation strategy by adding a high-growth, software-connected automated test and measurement systems business, which complements its industrial automation offerings. This move reflects Emerson's focus on building a cohesive, higher-growth industrial technology portfolio. However, the subsequent divestiture of its 40% stake in Copeland for $1.5 billion and the note receivable for $1.9 billion suggests a strategic rebalancing, where proceeds from asset sales like Copeland are being used to fund acquisitions like NI. This dynamic illustrates Emerson's intent to reallocate capital toward strategic, high-margin businesses while exiting non-core or partially owned ventures to streamline operations and enhance value creation.",

      "answer": "GE's increased allocation to growth assets, such as private equity and high-yield credit strategies, has led to a higher discount rate used in premium deficiency testing\u2014from 5.70% in 2020 to 6.15% in 2021. This increase contributed significantly to a larger premium deficiency testing margin, which reflects greater projected investment returns. However, this shift also introduces more earnings volatility due to the fair value accounting of these assets. The premium deficiency testing process, which evaluates the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, must now account for the uncertainty and variability in returns from these higher-risk investments. Despite favorable emerging morbidity experience, the testing continues to rely heavily on assumptions about future investment yields and reinsurance treaty structures, which are subject to change based on evolving market conditions and portfolio performance.",

Significant uncertainties exist in testing cash flow projections in the premium deficiency test for these insurance contracts, including consideration of a wide range of possible outcomes of future events over the life of the insurance contracts that can extend for long periods of time.\n\nGiven the significant judgments made by management in estimating the cash flow projections used in the premium deficiency test, including the determination of certain key assumptions, auditing the premium deficiency test required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists. Key assumptions impacting the cash flow projections that are sensitive and are more subjective requiring significant judgment by management are discount rate, rate of changes in morbidity, and future long-term care premium rate increases.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures, which included the involvement of our actuarial specialists, related to the premium deficiency analysis included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the premium deficiency test process, including controls over the development of key assumptions and management's judgments related to the development of the cash flow projections.\n- We tested the underlying data for completeness and accuracy, including historical cash flows and experience study data, that served as the basis for the actuarial estimates.\n- We evaluated the key assumptions by considering historical actual experience, sensitivity analyses, relevant industry data when available, and management's basis for changes or lack of change in key assumptions.\n- We performed recalculations to assess that the key assumptions were reflected in the cash flow projections.\n- We evaluated the impact of updated key assumptions to the projected cash flows and the overall conclusion for the premium deficiency test.\n\n## /s/ DELOITTE &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nFebruary 11, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2020.\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Electric Company\n\n## Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of General Electric Company and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

          "chunk_text": "Our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either ERAC or UFLIC as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

          "chunk_text": "The significant increase in the premium deficiency testing margin resulting from our 2021 premium deficiency testing was largely attributable to an increase in the overall discount rate to a weighted average rate of 6.15% compared to 5.70% in 2020 ($2.2 billion). This increase in the discount rate from 2020 reflects further progress of our previously communicated investment portfolio realignment strategy, that includes increased amounts allocated to growth assets, consisting of private equity, equity-like securities and select high yield credit strategies, from our previous target of approximately 8% up to approximately 15%. These amounts are expected to be funded over the next 5 to 7 years from the remaining projected capital contribution of approximately $5.5 billion through 2024 and regular portfolio cash flows while maintaining an overall A-rated fixed income portfolio. The 2021 discount rate assumptions also reflect a lower expected reinvestment rate on fixed-income investments versus that applied in 2020, due to lower prevailing benchmark interest rates in the U.S, grading to a lower expected long-term average investment yield over a shorter period and slightly lower actual yields on our fixed-income investment security portfolio. As a result of this increased allocation to higher-yielding assets, our run-off insurance operations may experience future earnings volatility due to investments carried at fair value with changes in fair values reported in earnings and changes in the allowance for credit losses, and temporary elevated amounts of unfunded investment commitments.\n\nWhile our observed long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some modest favorable emerging morbidity experience in the period since the 2017 reconstruction of our future claim cost projections, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. Based on the application of professional actuarial judgment to the factors discussed above, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, terminations, or long-term care insurance premium rate increases in 2021. As with all assumptions underlying our premium deficiency testing, we will continue to monitor these factors, which may result in future changes in our assumptions.\n\nSince our premium deficiency testing performed in 2020, we have implemented approximately $0.2 billion of previously approved long-term care insurance premium rate increase actions and made no substantial changes to the amount of projected future premium rate increase approvals. Our 2021 premium deficiency test includes approximately $1.7 billion of anticipated future premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, of which approximately $0.9 billion has been approved and not yet implemented. This represents a decrease of $0.2 billion from our 2020 premium deficiency test to account for actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030 and includes the effects of the higher discount rate mentioned above and longer anticipated timing to achieve and implement certain premium rate approvals.\n\nAs a result of exposure period cut-off dates to permit experience to develop and lags in ceding company data reporting from our ceding companies, the impact of COVID-19 was generally not reflected in the experience studies data used in our 2021 premium deficiency testing. However, we assessed certain scenarios to better understand potential impacts associated with COVID-19 and, due to the currently observed insignificance and perceived short-term nature of such uncertain future impacts, including the natural offsets from mortality in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products (i.e., for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments), concluded adjustments to our primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency testing were not warranted.\n\nWhen results of the premium deficiency testing indicate overall reserves are sufficient, we are also required to assess whether additional future policy benefit reserves are required to be accrued over time in the future. Such an accrual would be required if profits are projected in earlier future periods followed by losses projected in later future years (i.e., profits followed by losses). When this pattern of profits followed by losses is projected, we would be required to accrue a liability in the expected profitable years by the amount necessary to offset projected losses in later future years. We noted our projections as of third quarter 2021 indicate the present value of projected earnings in each future year to be positive, and therefore, no further adjustments to our future policy benefit reserves were required at this time.\n\nGAAP Reserve Sensitivities . The results of our premium deficiency testing are sensitive to the assumptions described above. Considering the results of the 2021 premium deficiency test which resulted in a margin, any future net adverse changes in our assumptions may reduce the margin or result in a premium deficiency requiring an increase to future policy benefit reserves. For example, hypothetical adverse changes in key assumptions related to our future policy benefits reserves, holding all other assumptions constant, would have the following estimated increase to the projected present value of future cash flows as presented in the table below. Any future net favorable changes to these assumptions could result in a lower projected present value of future cash flows and additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio, including higher investment income. The assumptions within our future policy benefit reserves are subject to significant uncertainties, including those inherent in the complex nature of our reinsurance treaties. Many of our assumptions are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities, the use of different factors or effect from converting to modeling future cash flow projections for our long-term insurance exposures to a \"first principles\" model based on more granular assumptions of expected future claim experience could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below.",

This fund is certified in the red zone, indicating it is less than 65% funded, and is subject to an implemented FIP. According to page 94, UPS\u2019s contributions satisfy the FIP requirements and do not require surcharges. However, the significant increase in contributions suggests that UPS, as a major contributor, remains heavily exposed to the fund\u2019s underfunded status.

      "question": "Given UPS's reliance on net asset value (NAV) to estimate the fair value of its U.S. pension plan investments, how does the company's exposure to private debt\u2014valued at $829 million as of December 31, 2022\u2014factor into the overall subjectivity and risk associated with NAV-based valuations for illiquid assets?",
      "answer": "UPS's U.S. pension plans held $9.9 billion in hedge fund, private debt, private equity, and real estate investments as of December 31, 2023, which were valued primarily using net asset value (NAV) from fund managers. Private debt, specifically, represented $829 million of the U.S. plan assets in 2022. These NAV-based valuations are inherently subjective due to the lack of readily determinable fair values and require management adjustments based on unaudited or audited reports received with a lag. Since private debt investments are illiquid and often lack active markets, their fair value estimates are particularly sensitive to assumptions and inputs used by fund managers. This subjectivity increases audit complexity and introduces valuation risk, especially given that unfunded commitments to such funds are expected to be contributed over the next 3\u20136 years, tying UPS to future capital obligations based on potentially uncertain valuations.",

        "Hop 1: [UPS](page_63) \u2192 [NAV]: UPS discloses that it estimates the value of U.S. pension plan investments in hedge funds, private debt, private equity, and real estate using NAV, which requires subjective adjustments and is based on unaudited or audited reports from fund managers.",
        "Hop 2: [NAV] \u2192 [Private Debt]: Private debt is one of the asset categories explicitly subject to NAV-based valuation due to the lack of a readily determinable fair value, and is included in the $9.9 billion total of NAV-dependent investments.",
        "Hop 3: [Private Debt] \u2190 [UPS](page_91): As of December 31, 2022, UPS reported $829 million in private debt investments within its U.S. pension plan, indicating a material exposure to this illiquid and subjectively valued asset class."

      "answer": "The cessation of future benefit accruals in the UPS Retirement Plan for non-union participants as of January 1, 2023, reflects a strategic shift away from defined benefit plans toward defined contribution plans, such as the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan. This shift aligns with the IRS-prescribed limits on tax-qualified plans, which constrain the maximum compensation and contributions that can be made on behalf of employees. In response, UPS transitioned non-union employees to a defined contribution model, where they now receive annual retirement contributions of 5% to 8% of eligible compensation based on years of service (up from 3% to 8% in 2023), subject to IRS limits. Additionally, UPS sponsors the UPS Restoration Savings Plan, a non-qualified plan that accommodates contributions exceeding IRS limits. This transition reflects both regulatory constraints and a broader strategic move to reduce long-term pension liabilities while maintaining competitive retirement benefits.",

We match, in cash, a portion of the participating employees' contributions.

Effective January 1, 2025, the UPS Retirement Plan contribution for certain non-union employees with an employment commencement date on or after January 1, 2025 is 3% of eligible compensation, regardless of years of vesting service. Retirement contributions charged to expense were $359, $380 and $83 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan provides for transition contributions to certain participants hired prior to 2008. The amounts charged to expense for transition contributions were $108 and $128 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no transition contributions in years prior to 2023.\n\nContributions under this plan are subject to maximum compensation and contribution limits for a tax-qualified defined contribution plan as prescribed by the IRS. The UPS Restoration Savings Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan for amounts that exceed these benefit limits.\n\nContributions are also made to defined contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were $135, $132 and $119 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nWe also sponsor certain international defined contribution plans, which are not individually material.\n\n## Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n\nInformation about net periodic benefit cost for the company-sponsored pension and postretirement defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\" (defined as \"AspenTech\" herein). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's prev ious name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' Due to the timing of the acquisition, the results for the first half of fiscal 2022 do not include the results of Heritage AspenTech.\n\nSee Notes 4, 5 and 8 and Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for further information on acquisitions and div estitures.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales for 2024 were $8,607, an increase of $869 compared with $7,738 in 2023, reflecting the impact of higher v olume and the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition. Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022. Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying v alue of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\n## GAIN ON SUBORDINATED INTEREST\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company receiv ed a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv  (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter of 2022, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share) and receiv ed the remaining $15 related to the pretax gain in the first quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Company receiv ed additional distributions totaling $161 ($122 after-tax, $0.21 per share) and in 2024, receiv ed its final distribution of $79 ($60 after-tax, $0.10 per share).\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $1,434 in 2024, an increase of $928 compared with 2023. The current year included intangibles amortization related to the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition of $560, while restructuring costs increased by $156 and acquisition/div estiture costs increased by $27. The Company also incurred div estiture losses of $48 ($50 after-tax, $0.09 per share).\n\nOther deductions, net were $506 in 2023, a decrease of $13 compared with 2022, and included higher intangibles amortization of $146 primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an unfav orable impact from foreign currency transactions of $112 reflecting losses in the current year compared to gains in the prior year.

      "answer": "The Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines segment, part of GE's Power business, saw a $2.1 billion (17%) organic revenue increase and a $1.0 billion (45%) improvement in segment losses for 2023, driven by cost reduction efforts and improved pricing. However, the broader Gas Turbines business, which includes Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines as a subset, faces significant operational execution risks that could threaten this progress. These risks include supply chain disruptions, quality control issues, and project delivery delays\u2014particularly on large-scale, complex projects with multiple subcontractors. The financial improvements in Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines may reflect progress in mitigating some of these risks, but the ongoing exposure in the broader Gas Turbines category suggests continued vulnerability to execution challenges, especially in international and consortium-based projects.",

      "answer": "GD reports $4,429 million in equity funds as part of its pension plan assets on page 96, with only $38 million of that amount measured using NAV as a practical expedient. This implies that the vast majority of equity fund valuations rely on observable market inputs (Level 1 and Level 2), which enhances transparency. However, the small NAV-measured portion, which typically involves less frequent and potentially less liquid valuations, could introduce some uncertainty in the overall valuation of equity funds. On page 97, equity funds under other post-retirement benefit plans are reported at $112 million with a clearer breakdown of fair value inputs, suggesting a higher degree of valuation transparency for that segment. This contrast highlights a potential difference in valuation reliability between the two reporting categories.",

        "Hop 2: Plan assets measured using NAV as a practical expedient \u2192 Equity funds: Equity funds represent a small portion of NAV-measured assets, which are typically used for less liquid or more complex investments that lack readily available market prices.",

      "question": "How does UPS's reliance on net asset value (NAV) estimates for its U.S. pension plan investments reconcile with the illiquidity and long-term nature of its real estate fund commitments totaling $3.3 billion?",
      "answer": "UPS utilizes estimated NAV to value its U.S. pension plan investments in hedge funds, private debt, private equity, and real estate, which totaled $9.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. These NAV-based valuations are derived from fund managers\u2019 financial reports and involve subjective adjustments due to the lack of active trading and readily determinable market values. This valuation approach introduces estimation risk, as the reported values may differ from what would be determined with more transparent market data. Meanwhile, the company has unfunded commitments of $3.3 billion to limited partnerships, including real estate funds, which are typically locked up for 10\u201315 years with limited redemption rights. The long-term, illiquid nature of these commitments contrasts with the NAV estimation process, which relies on periodic and potentially delayed financial reports. This creates a tension between the subjective, audit-intensive valuation methodology and the binding, long-duration investment profile of the real estate and private market assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(page_63) \u2192 NAV: Discloses that the U.S. pension and postretirement medical plans held $9.9 billion in hedge fund, private debt, private equity, and real estate investments, valued primarily based on estimated NAV derived from fund managers\u2019 financial reports with subjective adjustments.",
        "Hop 2: NAV \u2192 Real Estate Investments: NAV is used as a practical expedient to value real estate investments and other alternative assets that lack a readily determinable fair value, with values adjusted for investment activity between reporting periods.",

      "question": "What does EMR's increasing reported value of its AspenTech stake from $1 million in 2023 to $8 million in 2024 suggest about the strategic success of the 2022 business combination with Heritage AspenTech, particularly in relation to the $5.9 billion noncontrolling interest valuation recorded at the time of the transaction?",
      "answer": "EMR's increasing reported value of its AspenTech stake\u2014from $1 million in 2023 to $8 million in 2024\u2014suggests that the 2022 business combination with Heritage AspenTech has yielded positive strategic outcomes, at least in the context of stake valuation. This growth in value aligns with the broader goal of creating a stronger, more diversified industrial software entity. At the time of the transaction, EMR recorded a $5.9 billion noncontrolling interest for the 45% ownership stake held by former Heritage AspenTech stockholders, which was based on the fair value of AspenTech shares as of May 16, 2022. The subsequent increase in EMR\u2019s reported stake value implies that AspenTech's overall valuation or performance likely improved post-transaction, supporting the strategic rationale behind the combination. This increase may reflect successful integration of the Emerson Industrial Software Business or improved market positioning of AspenTech following the transaction.",

      "question": "How does Boeing's use of JPMorgan Chase Bank as syndication agent in its 364-Day Credit Agreement relate to the amendments made to the Five-Year Credit Agreement in August 2022, and what does this suggest about Boeing's short-term versus long-term financing strategy?",
      "answer": "Boeing's 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated August 24, 2023, names JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent, indicating the bank's role in structuring and managing this short-term financing instrument. Meanwhile, the Five-Year Credit Agreement, originally dated October 30, 2019, and subsequently amended on August 25, 2022, also lists JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the same capacity. The amendment to the longer-term agreement in August 2022 suggests that Boeing was actively revising its multi-year financing terms during a period of financial recalibration. The continued involvement of JPMorgan Chase Bank across both instruments implies a coordinated approach to liquidity management, with the 364-day agreement likely serving immediate operational needs while the amended five-year agreement supports longer-term capital structure stability. This dual engagement with the same syndication agent may reflect Boeing's effort to maintain consistent banking relationships while addressing different liquidity horizons.",

        "Hop 1: [BA](page_125) \u2192 [JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.]: JPMorgan is named as syndication agent in the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated August 24, 2023, indicating its role in short-term financing.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's EIP Plans, which purchased 78,000 shares in Q4 2023, represent a small but consistent component of the company's overall equity activity. These purchases are distinct from the broader $15.0 billion share repurchase program authorized in 2022, under which 19.5 million shares were repurchased during 2023. While the EIP Plans reflect ongoing employee participation in equity ownership, the repurchase program reflects strategic capital allocation decisions by the company. Together, they illustrate dual mechanisms influencing Caterpillar's equity base, with the EIP Plans contributing to employee engagement and the repurchase program aiming to enhance shareholder value.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of state and local income taxes on U.S. Government Contracts in the tax provision reconcile with the deferral of non-allocable contract costs under FAR, particularly in light of the $305 million in Other Contract Costs reported as deferred assets?",
      "answer": "The tax provision on page 66 indicates that state and local income taxes allocable to U.S. Government Contracts are included in operating costs rather than the tax provision, implying these taxes are directly tied to contract performance. Meanwhile, page 19 explains that U.S. Government Contracts are governed by FAR and CAS, which dictate cost allowability and allocation. Page 59 clarifies that certain costs, like workers' compensation and pension obligations, are deferred as Other Contract Costs until they can be allocated to contracts under FAR and CAS guidelines. The $305 million in deferred Other Contract Costs as of December 31, 2021, suggests that not all incurred costs are immediately recoverable under contract terms. This creates a nuanced relationship: while taxes are directly expensed on contracts, other costs must be deferred and recovered over time, subject to contract backlog and FAR compliance. The alignment hinges on how FAR governs cost recovery, which affects both tax treatment and deferred cost recognition.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

We  consider  securities  with  a maturity  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash  equivalents.  Our  cash  balances  are  invested  primarily  in  time deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investments in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We report our equity securities at fair value with subsequent changes in  fair  value  recognized  in  net  earnings.  We  report  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  at  fair  value  with unrealized  gains  and  losses  recognized  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. We had no trading or held-to-maturity debt securities on December 31, 2021 or 2020. See Note P for additional information regarding our investments in debt and equity securities.\n\nOther Contract Costs. Other contract costs represent amounts accrued under GAAP that are not currently allocable to U.S. government contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). These costs include workers' compensation, pension and other post-retirement benefits,  and  environmental  obligations.  We  defer  these  costs  in  other  current  assets  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet  until  they  can  be  allocated  to  contracts,  which  is  generally  after  they  are  paid.  We  expect  to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly  assess  the  probability  of  recovery  of  these  costs.  If  the  backlog  in  the  future  does  not  support  the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Other contract costs on December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $305 and $499, respectively.\n\nAcquisitions  and  Divestitures. In  the  last  three  years,  we  acquired  six  businesses  in  our  Aerospace segment,  two  businesses  in  our  Combat  Systems  segment  and  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment.  The operating results of these acquisitions have been included with our reported results since the respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\n\nIn  2020,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Aerospace  segment  and  two  businesses  in  our Technologies  segment,  one  of  which  was  classified  as  held  for  sale  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  on December  31,  2019.  In  2019,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment  that  was classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2018.\n\nLong-lived  Assets  and  Goodwill. We  review  long-lived  assets,  including  intangible  assets  subject  to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.",

      "answer": "MMM retains liability for PFAS-related product claims tied to Solventum's business sold prior to April 1, 2024, and certain claims from products sold between April 1, 2024, and January 1, 2026, even though Solventum now operates independently post-spin-off. At the same time, MMM still holds an equity interest in Solventum and intends to divest it within five years, though there is no assurance of timing or proceeds. This creates a dual exposure: MMM remains financially exposed to legacy PFAS liabilities from Solventum\u2019s products during the transition period, while also maintaining an ownership stake that is subject to market volatility and uncertain divestiture outcomes. The combination suggests that MMM\u2019s financial exposure to PFAS-related claims may persist alongside operational uncertainty regarding the eventual monetization of its Solventum stake.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFollowing the separation, the Company is a smaller, less diversified company than it was prior to the separation, which could make the Company more vulnerable to factors impacting its performance, such as changing market conditions and market volatility. In addition, the Company may be unable to find suitable alternatives for goods and services that Solventum temporarily provides to the Company pursuant to the agreements noted above, or such alternative goods and services may be more expensive than provided by Solventum to the Company.\n\nThe Company retained an equity interest in Solventum in connection with the spin-off. The Company cannot predict the trading price of shares of Solventum's common stock and the market value of the Solventum shares is subject to market volatility and other factors outside of the Company's control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Solventum within five years from the spin-off, but there can be no assurance regarding the timing of, or timeframe over which, such divestiture or divestitures may occur, or the amount of proceeds received by the Company in connection with any such divestitures.\n\nIn addition, while it is intended that the transaction be tax -free to the Company's stockholders for U.S. federal income tax  purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off is ultimately determined to be tax able, the Company, Solventum, or the Company's stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nThe Company has processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. These processes are integrated into the Company's overall risk management systems, as overseen by the Company's board of directors, primarily through its audit committee. These processes also include overseeing and identifying risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers. The Company conducts security assessments of certain third-party providers before engagement and has established monitoring procedures in its effort to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third parties. The Company from time to time engages third-party consultants, legal advisors, and audit firms in evaluating and testing the Company's risk management systems and assessing and remediating certain cybersecurity incidents. The Company also continues to provide its employees with cybersecurity and data protection training to support its risk mitigation efforts.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe audit committee of the Company's board of directors oversees, among other things, the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal controls, including internal controls designed to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The audit committee is informed of material risks from cybersecurity threats pursuant to the escalation criteria as set forth in the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Further, at least once per quarter, the Company's Chief Information and Digital Officer ('CIDO'), and/or the Company's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), reports on cybersecurity matters, including material risks and threats, to the Company's audit committee, and the audit committee provides updates to the Company's board of directors at regular board meetings. The CIDO also provides updates annually or more frequently as appropriate to the Company's board of directors.\n\n## Management\n\nUnder the oversight of the audit committee of the Company's board of directors, and as directed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the CIDO and CISO are primarily responsible for the assessment and management of material cybersecurity risks. The CIDO has more than two decades of experience with global technology organizations across multiple industries. The CISO has over 25 years of experience in information security, risk management, and compliance, has served as the chief information security officer at other organizations and, among other things, is a certified information systems security professional. The CIDO and CISO are also supported by a Cybersecurity &amp; Privacy Executive Oversight Committee, which is comprised of certain members of senior management and is provides crossfunctional support for cybersecurity risk management and facilitates the response to any cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe Company's CISO oversees the Company's cybersecurity incident response plan and related processes that are designed to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO also coordinates with the Company's legal counsel and third parties, such as consultants and legal advisors, to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents pursuant to criteria set forth in the Company's incident response plan and related processes.",

The Company will retain liabilities related to site-based PFAS contamination at any real property owned, leased or operated by the Company and liabilities for site-based PFAS contamination arising from third-party claims at sites allocated to the Solventum group in the separation to the extent such liabilities relate to PFAS contamination existing at or prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum assumes PFAS liabilities from the Solventum sites to the extent resulting from an action taken by any member of the Solventum group following April 1, 2024, or from any failure by Solventum following April 1, 2024, to use commercially reasonable efforts that are consistent with then-current industry standards to avoid contamination. The Company will also retain PFAS liabilities for product claims (x) arising from the Company's products, (y) arising from Solventum's products sold prior to April 1, 2024, and (z) arising from certain products sold by Solventum at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to the ex ceptions described below).

Solventum will be responsible for the maintenance of certain PFAS containment measures at its properties after the effective time of the distribution. In addition, and consistent with the allocation described above, the Company will retain specifically identified PFAS-related liabilities, including those resulting from specified PFAS-related litigation matters and liabilities under the Company's settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States, as described below.\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance recoveries the Company has recorded relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation: As of December 31, 2024, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 3,500 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,042 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company's mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n\nThe Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, is expected to represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in nineteen of the twenty cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below) and, in the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended two respirator product liability trials. In February 2024, a jury in Kentucky delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M's 8710 and 8210 respirators that the plaintiff claimed to have used were not defective. In April 2024, another jury in Kentucky returned a defense verdict in 3M's favor and concluded that 3M's 8710 respirator that the plaintiff claimed to have used was not defective.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to litigate and resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it ex perienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.",

An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, the  Company filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On December 7, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement (Settlement Agreement) and Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, which includes payment by Honeywell of $10 million to settle the claims in dispute. Honeywell continues to believe the claims lack merit and denies wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. The Settlement Agreement remains subject to final court approval and other conditions.\n\n## GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable.\n\nOn September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates  filed  voluntary  petitions  for  relief  under  Chapter  11  of  the  United  States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31,  2020,  the  Company  reviewed  the  aggregate  carrying  value  of  the  receivable  amounts  due  in  connection  with  the  Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements.\n\nOn April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett's amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on  April  30,  2021  (the  Effective  Date),  Garrett  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  On  the  Effective  Date,  and  in  accordance  with  the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending  legal  actions  related  to  the  Garrett  Indemnity  and  Tax  Matters  Agreement,  and  (iv)  all  pending  litigation  between  the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved.\n\nThe original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provides for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $35 million in 2022  and  $100  million  per  year  from  2023  to  2030  (inclusive)  at  the  anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  unless  (i)  Garrett's consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year is less than $425 million, or (ii) Garrett does not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due will accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also includes rights which allow (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions are met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions are met.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial  redemption.  The  First  Partial  Redemption  would  be  applied  to  the  latest  scheduled  redemption  dates,  beginning  with  the shares  to  be  redeemed  in  2030.  The Amendment  also  provides  that  the  Company  cannot  exercise  its  right  to  put  the  Series  B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption does not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation.\n\nOn December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerates the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allows Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before  March  31,  2022,  such  that  the  present  value  of  remaining  outstanding  shares  of  the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  will  be $207  million  (Second  Partial  Redemption).  The  Second  Partial  Redemption  is  subject  to  similar  terms  as  the  First  Partial Redemption, including that Garrett has funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption is also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How does Lockheed Martin's financial exposure to commercial customers relate to its equity earnings from ULA, and what does this imply about the relative contribution of commercial launch services to the Space segment's profitability?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin reports $665 million in receivables from commercial customers as of December 31, 2024, indicating a direct financial exposure to these entities. Through its 50% ownership in ULA \u2014 a company that provides expendable launch services to both the U.S. Government and commercial customers \u2014 LMT indirectly serves commercial launch demand. In 2024, equity earnings from ULA amounted to $45 million, representing 4% of the Space segment's operating profit. This suggests that while ULA serves commercial customers, the contribution from this channel to overall Space segment profitability remains relatively small. The modest equity earnings from ULA, despite the direct receivables from commercial customers, imply that the majority of LMT\u2019s commercial exposure in Space is likely tied to its own programs rather than through ULA's commercial launches.",

      "question": "How does the expected revenue increase from the G700 aircraft entry into service reconcile with the increased inventory costs tied to FAA certification delays mentioned in different sections of the 10-K?",
      "answer": "The Aerospace segment's operating margin increased by 50 basis points in 2023 to 13.7%, with expectations of reaching approximately 15% in 2024, driven by the anticipated entry into service of the G700 aircraft and an increase in new aircraft deliveries to approximately 160 (page 37). However, the ramp-up in production of new Gulfstream models, including the G700, led to an increase in total inventories in anticipation of FAA certification (page 71). This inventory buildup reflects the operational costs and financial risk associated with certification delays. Meanwhile, the company explicitly notes on page 5 that the G700 is expected to enter service following FAA certification in early 2024, indicating that the timing of certification directly impacts revenue realization. Therefore, the expected revenue growth hinges on timely FAA certification, while the increased inventory costs suggest that delays or uncertainties in certification could strain short-term financial performance.",

      "question": "How does the $829 million allocation to private debt in UPS's U.S. pension plans relate to the company's reliance on NAV estimates for auditing these illiquid investments?",
      "answer": "UPS allocated $829 million to private debt within its U.S. pension plans, which are valued using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient due to the lack of readily determinable fair values. These private debt investments are subject to subjective NAV estimations based on audited or unaudited financial reports from fund managers, with adjustments for investment activity between reporting periods. The audit process for these NAV-based valuations required significant auditor judgment and procedures to evaluate the reliability and completeness of inputs, including direct confirmation with fund managers and comparison of prior estimates to audited results. This creates a three-hop chain where the disclosed private debt amount (from the pension asset allocation table) is tied to NAV valuation practices and further to the audit scrutiny around those estimates, revealing both the strategic investment decision and the operational risk in reporting its value.",

      "answer": "GE's exposure to reinsurance contracts involving UFLIC, which hold $31.8 billion in trust assets, directly connects to the company's concern about future liquidity stress from adverse developments in its run-off insurance operations. These trust assets are subject to investment guidelines and may be withdrawn by ceding companies, potentially reducing UFLIC's control over these funds. This risk is compounded by GE's acknowledgment that solvency concerns about Genworth or its subsidiaries could lead to regulatory actions affecting UFLIC, thereby increasing the likelihood of liquidity stress or capital contributions. The quantitative scale of the trust assets ($31.8 billion) underscores the magnitude of exposure that could be impacted by adverse developments.",

      "answer": "UPS utilizes NAV as a practical expedient to value private equity fund investments due to the lack of readily determinable fair value, as disclosed in the notes on page 89. These investments are subject to limited redemption provisions, with unfunded commitments totaling approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, expected to be contributed over the next three to six years. Page 63 further emphasizes the subjectivity involved in NAV estimation and the audit challenges in validating these values, particularly for illiquid assets like private equity. This implies that UPS faces long-term liquidity risk, as the pension plan must fund these commitments without assurance of favorable market conditions or fund performance, while also relying on potentially uncertain NAV estimates for reporting.",

On page 75, the company discloses a $4 billion committed credit facility that supports these commercial paper issuances and serves general corporate purposes, with an expiration in March 2027. This timeline introduces a funding risk if the facility is not renewed or replaced, which contrasts with the company\u2019s stated confidence in maintaining a strong balance sheet and flexibility in capital deployment.

      "answer": "UPS's $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments to private equity funds indicates a strategic decision to maintain exposure to these illiquid assets despite the challenges in valuing them. The company relies on NAV as a practical expedient for valuing these investments due to the absence of a readily determinable fair value, which inherently introduces subjectivity and estimation uncertainty. These funds typically have long investment horizons (10\u201315 years) with limited redemption rights, locking in capital for extended periods. The significant unfunded commitment suggests UPS has confidence in the long-term performance and valuation reliability of these funds, even though the NAV-based approach may not fully capture market fluctuations or liquidity constraints.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(page_63) \u2192 NAV: UPS discloses its reliance on estimated NAV for valuing private equity and other alternative investments totaling $9.9 billion, noting the subjective nature of these valuations due to lack of active trading and reliance on fund manager inputs.",
        "Hop 2: NAV \u2192 Private Equity Funds: NAV is used as a practical expedient for valuing private equity funds, with adjustments made for investment activity between reporting periods, acknowledging that actual values may differ due to lack of market transparency.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's Space segment reported $45 million in equity earnings from its investment in ULA in 2024, which contributed to a 6% increase in the segment's operating profit. ULA, in which Lockheed holds a 50% stake, provides launch services to both the U.S. Government and commercial customers. On the other hand, Lockheed's receivables from commercial customers totaled $665 million as of December 31, 2024, indicating a significant financial exposure to this customer group. Since ULA serves commercial customers and Lockheed is financially tied to ULA through equity earnings, this creates a dual exposure: Lockheed benefits from ULA\u2019s commercial launch contracts while also directly extending credit to commercial customers. This dual relationship suggests that Lockheed's financial health is indirectly influenced by the success of ULA\u2019s commercial business and directly affected by the creditworthiness and payment behavior of commercial customers.",

This relationship is highlighted in the equity method investments section, where CFM International is described as a major related party with whom GE conducts substantial sales of parts and services. In 2024, this relationship directly influenced GE's working capital, as increased collections from CFM International contributed to a $0.9 billion impact on current receivables. Despite higher sales volume, the company experienced a decrease in overall working capital cash flow, indicating that the timing and volume of sales to CFM International play a critical role in GE's short-term liquidity position. This demonstrates how a strategic joint venture can have both operational and financial statement implications.",

Our share of the results of equity method investments is recognized within Other income (loss) in our Statement Earnings (Loss) since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with our operations. See Notes 9 and 26 for further information.\n\nWe enter into related party transactions with certain equity method investments, of which, the most significant are with CFM  International, a non-consolidated company jointly owned with Safran Aircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. We make substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International. Related party transactions with other equity method investees primarily consist of purchases of engine parts or maintenance services, which are not significant with any single related party.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVES. We receive grants and incentives from various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction which encourage investment, job creation and retention, and environmental objectives including emissions reductions. We recognize government grants as a reduction to the related expense or asset when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable. Government grants resulted in reductions of $117 million, $99 million and $100 million to research and development expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investment that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less, including debt securities and money market instruments unless classified as available-for-sale investment securities. Restricted cash primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters and amounted to an insignificant amount at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES. We report investments in available-for-sale debt securities and certain equity securities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded to earnings.\n\nAlthough we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio, we may sell debt securities prior to their maturities for a v ariety  of reasons, including div ersification, credit quality , y ield and liquidity  requirements and the funding of claims and obligations to policyholders.\n\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate qualitative criteria, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. We also evaluate quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to contain an expected credit loss, and we record the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings as an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security's recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security  or it is more likely  than not we will be required to sell the security  before recov ery  of its amortiz ed cost basis, the security  is considered impaired, and we recognize the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings. See Note 3 for further information.\n\nCURRENT RECEIVABLES. Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of equipment and services are recorded at the outstanding amount, less allowance for losses. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. When we record customer receivables and contract assets arising from revenue transactions, as well as commercial mortgage loans and reinsurance recoverables in our run-off insurance operations, financial guarantees and certain commitments, we record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses (CECL) inherent in the asset over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. We evaluate debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether any of the losses arise from concerns about the issuer's credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit losses, if required.\n\nWe estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.\n\nINVENTORIES. All inv entories are stated at lower of cost or realiz able v alues. Cost of inv entories is primarily  determined using the av erage cost method. See Note 5 for further information.\n\n44 2024 FORM  10-K",

          "chunk_text": "ABOUT GE AEROSPACE. General Electric Company operates as GE Aerospace (GE Aerospace or the Company). GE Aerospace is a global aerospace leader with the industry's largest and growing commercial propulsion fleet. The Company's installed base of approximately 45,000 commercial and 25,000 military engines drives our aftermarket services business, which represents approximately 70% of revenue, reflecting the strength of customer demand across our business. Through FLIGHT DECK, the Company's proprietary lean operating model, GE Aerospace is prioritizing safety, quality, delivery and cost, to drive focused execution and bridge strategy to results. We are focused on delivering against our strategic priorities for today (services and readiness), tomorrow (delivering the production and services ramp for new engines) and the future (inventing next generation flight technology for our commercial and defense customers). Our global team is building on more than a century of innovation and learning, as we invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the Company completed the separation of its healthcare business into an independent publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare), and on April 2, 2024, the Company completed the separation of its GE V ernova business into an independent publicly traded company, GE Vernova, Inc. (GE Vernova). In connection with these separations, the historical results of GE HealthCare and GE V ernova, and certain assets and liabilities included in the separations, are reported in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nWe serve customers in approximately 120 countries. M anufacturing and service operations are carried out at 67 facilities located in 22 states in the United States and Puerto Rico, of which 24 are owned, and at 67 facilities located in 24 other countries, of which 34 are owned.\n\nSEGMENTS. GE Aerospace operates through two reportable segments: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies.\n\nCOMMERCIAL ENGINES &amp; SERVICES. Commercial Engines &amp; Services (CES) designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines for commercial airframes, as well as business aviation and aeroderivative applications. Services include maintenance, repair and overhaul (M RO) of engines and the sale of spare parts, and we offer services under a variety of arrangements such as long-term service agreements or time and material contracts. CES was approximately 70% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 74% of total CES revenue.\n\nOur CES customers for equipment and services consist primarily of airframers and airlines, including both Boeing and A irbus, and third-party M RO shops, to whom we sell equipment and license M RO technology. CES engines power aircraft in all commercial categories-narrowbody, widebody and regional-and this includes engines sold by joint venture partners, the most significant of which is CFM  International, a 50-50 non-consolidated joint venture with Safran A ircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. Depending on the aircraft model, airline customers may have a choice between our engines and those of other manufacturers or, as in the case of some Boeing models, our engines may be the sole source engine for a particular aircraft.\n\nCommercial and financial dynamics for major engine platforms often play out over the course of many years, as new product development cycles are long and, after initial sale, commercial engines can operate for decades with services in the aftermarket. In the narrowbody aircraft segment, we are in the midst of a significant ramp in production of the LEA P engine, which entered into service in 2016 and is expected in the coming years to overtake the mature CFM 56 as the industry's most utilized narrowbody engine. This is expected to also drive a significant increase in shop visits and need for M RO capacity as LEA P engines come due for services. In the widebody aircraft segment, we have a range of engine platforms that are in different stages of their lifecycles. These include the more mature CF6 and GE90 engines, as well as the GEnx engine that entered into service in 2011 and the GE9X engine that will power the Boeing 777X  when that aircraft enters into serv ice. We also have engines that power regional and business aircraft.\n\nWe have been and remain committed to investing in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. Notably, CFM International's Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program is a suite of pioneering technologies including Open Fan, compact core and hybrid electric systems for compatibility with alternative fuels. We recently completed more than 250 tests on developing a full-scale Open Fan engine. This is one of several initiativ es underway to help invent the future of flight.\n\nDEFENSE &amp; PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES. Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies (DPT) is a leading provider of defense engines and critical aircraft systems, and it consists of our Defense &amp; Systems and Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technologies businesses. DPT was approximately 25% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 56% of total DPT revenue.\n\nDefense &amp; Systems - Defense &amp; Systems designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines and avionics and power systems for governments, militaries and commercial airframers. Services include M RO of engines and the sale of spare parts.\n\nOur product performance and dedication to innovation have earned long-standing relationships with airframers, shipyards, government agencies and other customers globally. We also regularly work with government customers on the development of classified and unclassified advanced products, including combat engines, hypersonics and unmanned applications. Recently, our team successfully demonstrated a hybrid electric propulsion system rated at one megawatt with the U.S. A rmy.\n\nOur defense engines power a wide variety of fighters, bombers, tankers, transport, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as aeroderivative engines for marine applications. Significant product platforms include the F110, F404 and F414 for combat engines, the T408, T700 and T901 for rotorcraft engines and the LM2500 for mobility and marine engines.",

      "question": "Given that UPS satisfies all implemented FIP requirements for its multiemployer pension plans, how does the company's contribution pattern to the I.A.M. National Pension Fund / National Pension Plan reflect the financial improvement obligations under the FIP, especially considering the plan's red zone status and the approaching 2024 expiration of its associated collective bargaining agreement?",
      "answer": "UPS satisfies all implemented FIP requirements for its multiemployer pension plans, including the I.A.M. National Pension Fund / National Pension Plan, which is in the red zone and subject to a FIP that has been implemented. UPS's contributions to this plan have increased steadily from $48 million in 2021 to $50 million in 2023, aligning with the financial improvement obligations under the FIP. This upward trend in contributions suggests UPS is actively meeting its commitments under the FIP to support the underfunded red zone plan. The associated collective bargaining agreement for this plan is set to expire in July 2024, which may necessitate renegotiation of these contribution levels in the near future, adding potential financial pressure on UPS as it seeks to maintain compliance with pension funding requirements while managing labor cost structures.",

      "question": "Given that UPS's contributions satisfy all implemented FIP requirements, how does the funding status of the Employer-Teamsters Local Nos. 175 & 505 Pension Trust Fund, which remains in the red zone, impact UPS's long-term pension liability exposure despite meeting current contribution obligations?",
      "answer": "UPS satisfies all implemented FIP requirements, and its contributions do not currently require surcharges or additional payments beyond contractual rates. The Employer-Teamsters Local Nos. 175 & 505 Pension Trust Fund is in the red zone for both 2022 and 2023, indicating severe underfunding. Despite UPS's compliance with current contribution obligations, the persistent red zone status of this pension fund suggests ongoing financial instability, which could lead to future funding obligations or increased contributions for UPS if additional financial improvement measures or rehabilitation plans are imposed.",

        "Hop 1: [UPS](page_94) \u2192 [FIP Requirements]: UPS satisfies all implemented FIP requirements and does not face surcharges or additional minimum contributions.",

      "answer": "The total value of equity funds included in GD's pension plan assets is $4,467 million, combining the $4,429 million reported in the fair value hierarchy and the $38 million measured using NAV as a practical expedient. The equity funds in the fair value hierarchy are primarily valued using significant other observable inputs (Level 2), amounting to $3,961 million, with a smaller portion based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) at $468 million. In contrast, the $38 million of equity funds measured using NAV as a practical expedient are not categorized into the fair value hierarchy levels, indicating a different valuation approach that relies on NAV rather than direct market or observable inputs.",

      "question": "What are the implications for transparency and reliability in UPS's reported $9.9 billion in alternative investments, given its use of NAV as a practical expedient for valuing real estate holdings and the $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments tied to these investments?",
      "answer": "UPS utilizes net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient to value its real estate and other alternative investments, such as private debt and private equity funds, due to the lack of readily determinable fair values. This approach introduces subjectivity and estimation uncertainty, as these valuations rely on audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, adjusted for investment activity up to year-end. The company reports $9.9 billion in such alternative investments as of December 31, 2023, but notes that the lack of active trading and reliance on subjective assumptions could result in reported values that differ from actual market values. Additionally, UPS has $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments tied to these investments, expected to be contributed over the next 3 to 6 years. These commitments further complicate transparency, as future contributions are contingent on fund needs and not fully predictable. Together, these factors raise concerns about the reliability of the $9.9 billion figure and the overall transparency of UPS's exposure to alternative investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [UPS](page_89) \u2192 [Real Estate Investments]: UPS reports its real estate investments as part of a broader category of alternative investments valued using NAV due to the absence of a readily determinable fair value.",
        "Hop 2: [Real Estate Investments] \u2192 [NAV]: These investments are subject to valuation using NAV as a practical expedient, which introduces estimation uncertainty and is not classified in the standard fair value hierarchy.",
        "Hop 3: [NAV] \u2190 [UPS](page_63): UPS discloses that its U.S. pension and postretirement medical benefit plans held $9.9 billion in alternative investments, including real estate, hedge funds, private debt, and private equity, all valued using NAV and subject to audit scrutiny due to their subjective nature."

      "answer": "In 2023, Aeroderivatives accounted for 36.3% of GE Gas Turbines unit sales (33 out of 91 total units), down from 47.5% in 2022 (48 out of 101 total units). This decline indicates a strategic shift in GE\u2019s Gas Turbines business mix, with a reduced emphasis on Aeroderivatives and a relative increase in focus on other gas turbine categories such as Heavy-Duty and HA-Turbines.

This repeated engagement indicates a strategic reliance on JPMorgan Chase for structuring and managing Boeing\u2019s credit facilities. The syndication role implies that JPMorgan Chase plays a key part in coordinating lender groups and ensuring Boeing has access to sufficient liquidity.

      "question": "How does the $305 million deferral of contract costs under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines reconcile with the immediate recognition of state and local taxes allocable to U.S. government contracts in GD's financial reporting?",
      "answer": "The $305 million in deferred contract costs on December 31, 2021, represents expenses such as workers' compensation, pensions, and environmental obligations that GD cannot currently allocate to U.S. government contracts under FAR and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). These costs are deferred until they can be allocated to contracts through existing backlog or future follow-on contracts. In contrast, state and local income taxes allocable to U.S. government contracts are recognized immediately in operating costs and expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This dual treatment reveals a regulatory distinction: certain costs are deferred under FAR\u2019s cost allowability and allocation rules, while others like state and local taxes are directly charged to earnings. This creates a timing mismatch in how contract-related expenses are recognized, which could affect the reported profitability of GD\u2019s government contracts in different reporting periods.",

        "Hop 1: GD(page_59) \u2192 FAR: GD defers $305 million in contract costs under FAR and CAS guidelines because they are not currently allocable to U.S. government contracts.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSee Note K for information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates.\n\nCash and Equivalents and Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We  consider  securities  with  a maturity  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash  equivalents.  Our  cash  balances  are  invested  primarily  in  time deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investments in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We report our equity securities at fair value with subsequent changes in  fair  value  recognized  in  net  earnings.  We  report  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  at  fair  value  with unrealized  gains  and  losses  recognized  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. We had no trading or held-to-maturity debt securities on December 31, 2021 or 2020. See Note P for additional information regarding our investments in debt and equity securities.\n\nOther Contract Costs. Other contract costs represent amounts accrued under GAAP that are not currently allocable to U.S. government contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). These costs include workers' compensation, pension and other post-retirement benefits,  and  environmental  obligations.  We  defer  these  costs  in  other  current  assets  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet  until  they  can  be  allocated  to  contracts,  which  is  generally  after  they  are  paid.  We  expect  to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly  assess  the  probability  of  recovery  of  these  costs.  If  the  backlog  in  the  future  does  not  support  the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Other contract costs on December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $305 and $499, respectively.\n\nAcquisitions  and  Divestitures. In  the  last  three  years,  we  acquired  six  businesses  in  our  Aerospace segment,  two  businesses  in  our  Combat  Systems  segment  and  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment.  The operating results of these acquisitions have been included with our reported results since the respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\n\nIn  2020,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Aerospace  segment  and  two  businesses  in  our Technologies  segment,  one  of  which  was  classified  as  held  for  sale  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  on December  31,  2019.  In  2019,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment  that  was classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2018.\n\nLong-lived  Assets  and  Goodwill. We  review  long-lived  assets,  including  intangible  assets  subject  to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

      "answer": "MMM retains PFAS-related liabilities for product claims arising from Solventum's products sold at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026, unless those products fall under specific exceptions such as new PFAS-enabled products or modifications made post-spinoff. This ongoing exposure is reflected in MMM's contingent liability disclosures on page 84, where the company emphasizes its process for estimating and recording liabilities related to legal proceedings under ASC 450, including adjustments based on developments in litigation and settlement negotiations. Despite the spin-off of Solventum, MMM must continue to account for and disclose these retained PFAS liabilities, which introduces a layer of financial and reputational risk that is not fully transferred to Solventum. This creates a need for MMM to maintain robust risk management practices, including monitoring litigation trends, estimating potential losses, and evaluating insurance recoveries related to these claims.",

The Company will retain all PFASrelated liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of (x ) the Company's business (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement) and (y) Solventum's business (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement) prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum will retain liability for all PFAS-related liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of its business at or after April 1, 2024, other than liabilities from product claims alleging harm from the presence of PFAS in certain products of Solventum's business sold at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to ex ceptions described in further detail below). The Company will retain liabilities related to site-based PFAS contamination at any real property owned, leased or operated by the Company and liabilities for site-based PFAS contamination arising from third-party claims at sites allocated to the Solventum group in the separation to the extent such liabilities relate to PFAS contamination existing at or prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum assumes PFAS liabilities from the Solventum sites to the extent resulting from an action taken by any member of the Solventum group following April 1, 2024, or from any failure by Solventum following April 1, 2024, to use commercially reasonable efforts that are consistent with then-current industry standards to avoid contamination. The Company will also retain PFAS liabilities for product claims (x) arising from the Company's products, (y) arising from Solventum's products sold prior to April 1, 2024, and (z) arising from certain products sold by Solventum at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to the ex ceptions described below). Clause (z) in the immediately preceding sentence will not ex tend to PFAS liabilities for product claims resulting from (i) new products introduced by Solventum following April 1, 2024, that contain or are enabled by PFAS that is not supplied by the Company, (ii) products that are modified by Solventum after April 1, 2024, to add, contain or become enabled by PFAS that is not supplied by the Company, or with respect to which any modification made after April 1, 2024, in the formulation or production of the product that changes the amount or type of PFAS contained in the product or the amount or type of PFAS enabling the product, in each case from and after the date of such modification, (iii) PFAS that is added to a Solventum product after it is sold by Solventum and (iv) PFAS that has accumulated in or on a Solventum product as a result of the use of the product (whether or not the product is being used as directed), including through filtration, purification or similar application. Solventum will be responsible for the maintenance of certain PFAS containment measures at its properties after the effective time of the distribution. In addition, and consistent with the allocation described above, the Company will retain specifically identified PFAS-related liabilities, including those resulting from specified PFAS-related litigation matters and liabilities under the Company's settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States, as described below.\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance recoveries the Company has recorded relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation: As of December 31, 2024, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 3,500 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,042 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company's mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n\nThe Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, is expected to represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in nineteen of the twenty cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below) and, in the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended two respirator product liability trials. In February 2024, a jury in Kentucky delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M's 8710 and 8210 respirators that the plaintiff claimed to have used were not defective. In April 2024, another jury in Kentucky returned a defense verdict in 3M's favor and concluded that 3M's 8710 respirator that the plaintiff claimed to have used was not defective.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to litigate and resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it ex perienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.",

Solventum will be responsible for the maintenance of certain PFAS containment measures at its properties after the effective time of the distribution. In addition, and consistent with the allocation described above, the Company will retain specifically identified PFAS-related liabilities, including those resulting from specified PFAS-related litigation matters and liabilities under the Company's settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States, as described below.\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance recoveries the Company has recorded relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation: As of December 31, 2024, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 3,500 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,042 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company's mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n\nThe Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, is expected to represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in nineteen of the twenty cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below) and, in the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended two respirator product liability trials. In February 2024, a jury in Kentucky delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M's 8710 and 8210 respirators that the plaintiff claimed to have used were not defective. In April 2024, another jury in Kentucky returned a defense verdict in 3M's favor and concluded that 3M's 8710 respirator that the plaintiff claimed to have used was not defective.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to litigate and resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it ex perienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on ex perience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably estimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings, and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\n\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in ex cess of presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters for which no accruals are currently recorded, because losses are not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages, or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions, that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages, but with which the Company may not agree. Such information may or may not lead the Company to determine that it is able to make a reasonable estimate as to a probable loss or range of loss in connection with a matter. However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, future adverse rulings or developments, or settlements in, one or more matters could result in future changes to determinations of probable and reasonably estimable losses in other matters.\n\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings: The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their ex clusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its ex perience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company's insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an ex pense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\n\nImpact of Solventum Spin-Off : On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its Health Care business as an independent company known as Solventum. Concurrent with the spin-off, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements, including transition agreements and a separation and distribution agreement that, among other things, identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, indemnification and defense obligations, and the contracts to be transferred to Solventum and 3M as part of the spin-off. In general, and except as noted below and as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, certain liabilities related to Solventum or the assets that are transferred to Solventum in connection with the spin-off will be retained by or transferred to Solventum. For example, potential liabilities associated with the matters previously described in prior filings under the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation sections of this Note 19 have been assumed by Solventum pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, and Solventum will indemnify and defend the Company in these actions.",

      "question": "How does UPS's $50 million contribution to the I.A.M. National Pension Fund in 2023 align with its broader approach to multiemployer pension obligations, particularly given the fund's red zone status and implemented FIP requirements?",
      "answer": "UPS contributed $50 million to the I.A.M. National Pension Fund in 2023, which is part of a broader pattern of contributions totaling $2,953 million across all multiemployer pension plans for that year. The I.A.M. fund is in the red zone under the Pension Protection Act and has an implemented Financial Improvement Plan (FIP), which UPS satisfies through its collectively bargained contributions. Notably, UPS states that these contributions meet all implemented FIP and RP requirements without triggering surcharges, indicating a strategy of compliance through existing negotiated agreements rather than additional payments. This approach aligns with UPS\u2019s overall pension strategy of meeting obligations without incurring extra costs, even for underfunded plans like the I.A.M. National Pension Fund.",

      "question": "What does Boeing's continued use of JPMorgan Chase as syndication agent in both its 364-Day and Five-Year Credit Agreements suggest about its credit strategy, particularly after the 2022 amendment to the latter?",
      "answer": "Boeing\u2019s continued engagement of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent across multiple credit agreements\u2014including the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated August 24, 2023, and the Five-Year Credit Agreement originally dated October 30, 2019, and subsequently amended on August 25, 2022\u2014suggests a strategic preference for maintaining a stable and trusted relationship with key financial partners. The 2022 amendment to the Five-Year Credit Agreement indicates an ongoing effort to adapt financial arrangements to evolving market or operational conditions, while preserving the core syndication structure led by JPMorgan. This continuity implies that Boeing views JPMorgan\u2019s role as integral to managing liquidity, credit access, and lender coordination, especially during periods of financial restructuring or uncertainty.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [BA](page_125) \u2192 [JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.]: JPMorgan is named as syndication agent and joint lead arranger in both the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated August 24, 2023, showing its active and repeated involvement in Boeing\u2019s financing structure.",
        "Hop 2: [JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.] \u2192 [Five Year Credit Agreement]: JPMorgan serves in a key coordinating role (syndication agent and joint lead arranger) in the Five-Year Credit Agreement, a role reaffirmed in the 2022 amendment, indicating its importance in managing lender relationships.",
        "Hop 3: [Five Year Credit Agreement] \u2190 [BA](page_126): The original Five-Year Credit Agreement (2019) and its 2022 amendment are both listed in the exhibits, showing Boeing\u2019s ongoing reliance on this facility and the continued involvement of JPMorgan despite modifications."

      "answer": "The MD-80 Aircraft valuation declined by $25M from 2020 ($167M) to 2021 ($142M), indicating a significant drop in fair value. According to the valuation methodology on page 81, Boeing determines fair value using aircraft-specific data, market conditions, and third-party valuations. This decline would trigger an impairment review under the stated process that evaluates assets when expected undiscounted cash flows may fall below carrying values. Given that sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables with allowances established for losses, this valuation drop would directly increase the allowance for losses on receivables, as differences between carrying values and fair values are considered in determining these allowances.",

Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but  are  not  limited  to,  the  resale  market,  which  could  potentially  include  the  cost  of  long-term  storage;  the  leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer's requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly  basis,  we  update  our  valuation  analysis  based  on  the  actual  activities  associated  with  placing  each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.\n\nUsed aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing.\n\nCustomer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset.\n\nWe  assess  the  fair  value  of  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateral underlying receivables to determine if their  fair  values  are  less  than  the  related  customer  financing  assets'  carrying values.  Differences  between  carrying  values  and  fair  values  of  sales-type/finance  leases  and  notes  and  other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables.\n\nWe use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on  the  type  and  age  of  the  aircraft  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  aircraft.  Under  certain  circumstances,  we  apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications.\n\nImpairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining",

      "question": "Given HA Turbines' 27% year-over-year sales increase, how significant was this product line's contribution to the Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines segment's $2.1 billion revenue growth in GE's Power business, and how does this align with GE's positioning of gas turbines as part of its energy transition strategy toward lower carbon solutions?",
      "answer": "HA Turbines saw a 27% year-over-year increase in unit sales, rising from 11 units in 2022 to 14 units in 2023. As a subset of Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines, which totaled 58 units sold in 2023 (up from 53 in 2022), HA Turbines contributed approximately 21% of the segment's unit growth. This growth occurred within the broader context of GE's Power segment, which reported a $2.1 billion (17%) organic revenue increase driven by equipment revenue growth across several business lines. Notably, the Gas Power business, which includes Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines, is positioned by GE as part of its energy transition strategy toward lower carbon solutions, with gas turbines serving as a bridge technology that enables reliable power generation while supporting decarbonization efforts. The HA Turbines' growth therefore appears aligned with GE's strategic narrative around gas turbines playing a transitional role in the energy mix.",

        "Hop 1: GE(page_12) \u2192 HA Turbines: HA Turbine unit sales increased 27% year-over-year from 11 units (2022) to 14 units (2023), representing a notable growth within the Gas Turbines product family.",
        "Hop 2: HA Turbines \u2192 Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines: HA Turbines are explicitly described as a subset of Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines, creating a direct hierarchical relationship between the two product lines.",
