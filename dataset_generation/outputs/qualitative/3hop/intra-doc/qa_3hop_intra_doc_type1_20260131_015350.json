      "question": "How did the tax legislation enacted by Alabama in February 2021 impact Southern Power's net income, and what does this reveal about the financial implications of state-level regulatory changes on Southern Company's operations in specific jurisdictions?",
      "answer": "The tax legislation enacted by Alabama in February 2021 changed the state's apportionment methodology, resulting in a tax benefit that contributed to Southern Power's $28 million increase in net income for 2021. This benefit was reported in the MD&A section on page 81 and was significant enough to offset rising operational costs. The connection to Alabama is established through Southern Company's operational presence there via Alabama Power, as noted in the financial statement footnotes on page 194. This illustrates how state-level regulatory changes can directly affect the financial performance of Southern Company's subsidiaries, particularly in jurisdictions where they have substantial operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

However, despite this regulatory treatment, Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes in natural gas markets, which can materially affect results of operations (page 318).

See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.\n\nEnergy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:\n\n- Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.\n- Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.\n- Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.\n\nSome energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's reliance on cost recovery mechanisms for environmental remediation align with the $233 million in environmental remediation liabilities reported specifically by Southern Company Gas in 2024?",
      "answer": "Southern Company Gas reports $233 million in environmental remediation liabilities on page 178, indicating a significant financial obligation tied to past environmental impacts. This liability is covered under broader cost recovery mechanisms described on page 280, which allow the company to recover certain costs\u2014including those related to environmental remediation\u2014through regulated rate adjustments. However, the presence of this specific liability suggests that not all environmental remediation costs have yet been recovered, highlighting a gap between incurred obligations and actual cost recovery execution. This dynamic underscores the regulatory and financial risk associated with environmental remediation, despite the availability of recovery mechanisms.",

S outhern Company Gas amortizes the fair value adjustments over the remaining lives of the respective bonds, the latest being through 2043.\n\nThe fair values are determined using Level 2 measurements and are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates available to the Registrants.\n\n## 14. DERIVATIVES\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency ex change rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these ex posures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis. See Note 13 for additional fair value information. In the statements of cash flows, any cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with the classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively. See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe Subsidiary Registrants enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to costbased rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-ex change-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-ex change-traded contracts are reflected in natural gas revenues.",

Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC.\n\nIn addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms.\n\n## Integrated Resource Planning\n\nEach of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix  of resources to meet the ex isting and future demand requirements of its customers. In addition, each year the Southern Company system engages in a scenario planning process, developing scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In 2024, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO prices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of CO  emitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 7 herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies, as well as a discussion of the Southern Company system's continued generating fleet transition. 2 2\n\n## Alabama Power\n\nTriennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet ex pected customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs any new generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business. Alabama Power provided its most recent IRP to the Alabama PSC during 2022. On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nTriennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. In 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the G eorgia PSC, and certain intervenors. On January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP with the G eorgia PSC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" and \" - Rate Plans\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's use of intra-contract netting in derivative agreements affect its exposure to events of default, particularly in light of the $106 million in cash collateral posted by Southern Power and the potential for collateral requirements triggered by credit downgrades?",
      "answer": "Southern Company utilizes intra-contract netting in derivative agreements to offset receivables and payables, including those arising from events of default, which helps mitigate counterparty credit risk. This netting is reflected in the fair value presentation of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. However, the company remains exposed to events of default as certain agreements may require collateral posting, particularly if a subsidiary's credit rating drops below investment grade. Southern Power had $106 million in cash collateral posted under PPAs that could require additional collateral upon a credit downgrade, even though accelerated payment is not mandated.

      "answer": "The divestiture of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities in February 2023 likely reduces Duke Energy's direct exposure to FERC cybersecurity compliance risks associated with operating interstate natural gas infrastructure, as KO Transmission is no longer an active subsidiary. However, since Duke Energy remains subject to FERC regulations through other entities like Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio's remaining operations, the company still faces cybersecurity compliance obligations under FERC-enforced standards such as those from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The risk factors section highlights that cybersecurity breaches could lead to operational disruption, financial loss, and regulatory penalties, which remain relevant even after the divestiture due to Duke Energy\u2019s continued regulated operations under FERC oversight.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(page_24) \u2192 KO Transmission: KO Transmission was a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio engaged in interstate natural gas transportation and sold all pipeline facilities on February 1, 2023.",

      "answer": "NEE has noncontrolling investments in limited partnerships totaling $3,315 million as of December 31, 2024, with commitments to invest an additional $175 million. These limited partnerships are part of broader investment vehicles used across NEE's subsidiaries. The NEE pension plan, which aims to achieve a high rate of total return with prudent risk, includes limited partnerships as part of its convertible securities allocation, which makes up 5% of the pension fund\u2019s target asset allocation. This indicates that NEE leverages limited partnerships not only as a direct investment vehicle but also as a component of its pension fund's diversified investment strategy, particularly in convertible securities, to enhance returns while managing risk.",

A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these V IEs consisted primarily of property , plant and equipment and accounts payable.\n\nOther - A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $5,848 million ($4,506 million at FPL) and $4,962 million ($3,899 million at FPL), respectively , which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not inv olv ed in the initial design of these entities and do not hav e a controlling financial interest in these entities.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in X PLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered V IEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE's investment in these entities totaled approximately $3,315 million and $3,913 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . A t December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $175 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 - Commitments and - Contracts, respectively.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to three land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to 34 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $372 million and $387 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $396 million and $412 million. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases totaled approximately $826 million and $840 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $440 million and $444 million. NEE's lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.83% and 3.96%, respectively , for operating leases and 4.92% and 4.32%, respectively , for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 44 years and 44 years, respectively , for operating leases and 33 years and 32 years, respectively , for finance leases. A t December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $2.6 billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. A t December 31, 2024, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2026 to 2044 and NEE expects to receive approximately $3.9 billion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the  power  sales  agreements  with  no  one  year  being  material.  Operating  and  sales-type  lease-related  amounts  were  not  material  to  NEE's  consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n\n## 11. Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset  retirement  costs  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  method  the  regulator  allows  for  recovery  in  rates.  See  Note  1  -  Rate  Regulation  and  Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's ability to receive dividends from Nicor Gas, which contributed a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses passed through to customers, relate to the $1.3 billion in restricted retained earnings mentioned in the dividend restrictions section?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's ability to receive dividends from Nicor Gas is constrained by regulatory requirements that limit dividend payments to the amount of Nicor Gas' retained earnings, which totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021. Nicor Gas contributed to a $15 million increase in Southern Company Gas' revenue tax expenses in 2021, indicating that despite this operational cost being passed through to customers, the regulatory dividend restriction remains a key financial constraint. This means that while Nicor Gas may generate revenue and contribute to operational expenses, its ability to transfer retained earnings to Southern Company is capped by its restricted retained earnings balance, limiting Southern Company's access to that capital for its own purposes such as dividend distributions to shareholders.",

At December 31, 2021, consolidated retained earnings included $4.4 billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.\n\nSee Note 7 under \"Southern Power\" for information regarding the distribution requirements for certain Southern Power subsidiaries.\n\nBy regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2021, the amount of Southern Company Gas' subsidiary retained earnings restricted for dividend payment totaled $1.3 billion.\n\n## Structural Considerations\n\nSince Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies, the right of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas and, hence, the right of creditors of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas to participate in any distribution of the assets of any respective subsidiary of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas, whether upon liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of such subsidiary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' 100%-owned subsidiary, Southern Company Gas Capital, was established to provide for certain of Southern Company Gas' ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt, hybrid securities, and other financing arrangements. Southern Company Gas fully and unconditionally guarantees all debt issued by Southern Company Gas Capital. Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern Company Gas Capital for its financing needs.\n\nSouthern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loan, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangement are unsecured senior indebtedness, which rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Company. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under any of these unsecured senior debt arrangements, which are effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of creditors of Southern Power's subsidiaries.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020.

      "question": "How does Southern Company's financial dependency on SCS for power pool services relate to its equity earnings from SNG, given SCS's role in arranging natural gas transportation through SNG?",
      "answer": "Southern Company (SO) relies on SCS to arrange natural gas transportation services from SNG, which is a key input for power generation. In 2024, SO incurred significant costs through SCS for these services, which are included in operations and maintenance expenses or capitalized. SCS, acting as an agent for SO's subsidiaries, manages long-term agreements with SNG for gas transportation, which are essential for fulfilling energy production needs. Meanwhile, Southern Company Gas, a subsidiary of SO, earns equity method income from its investment in SNG, totaling $146 million in 2024. This creates a dual relationship where SO indirectly supports SNG through contracted transportation fees (via SCS), while also benefiting financially from SNG\u2019s performance through equity earnings. The interplay highlights a strategic alignment in SO\u2019s upstream and downstream operations, balancing cost obligations with investment returns within the same value chain.",

      "answer": "Southern Power has $106 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements that could increase if its credit rating is downgraded. These PPAs require credit assurances without specifying a rating, but the collateral amount depends on actual losses from a downgrade. This exposure is connected to intra-contract netting provisions in derivative agreements that allow for netting of receivables and payables, including during events of default. These netting provisions, which apply across product lines and against cash collateral, help mitigate counterparty credit risk. The relevance of this connection has been heightened by recent credit rating actions: S&P revised its outlook to positive from stable on August 2, 2023, and Fitch upgraded Georgia Power's debt rating to A- from BBB+ on September 1, 2023, potentially affecting both the likelihood of collateral calls and the effectiveness of netting arrangements.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress issued $237 million and $770 million, respectively, in storm recovery bonds in November 2021, forming a total of $1.007 billion in financing to recover storm costs from 2018 and 2019. These bonds are secured by storm recovery property, which includes the right to impose non-bypassable charges on retail customers until the bonds are fully paid. The bond issuance is linked to restricted cash balances reported on page 127, which are specifically tied to VIEs (Variable Interest Entities) formed for storm recovery bonds. This implies that the financial structure of storm cost recovery is asset-backed and ring-fenced through special-purpose entities, with restricted cash serving as collateral to ensure bondholder security without recourse to the parent companies.",

        "Hop 2: Storm Recovery Property \u2192 Storm Recovery Bonds: The storm recovery property is directly tied to the bonds, as it serves as collateral and provides the cash flow mechanism through customer charges to repay the debt.",

SNG is developing a $3 billion pipeline project, with Southern Company Gas responsible for 50% of the costs, or $1.5 billion. Given that the project is not expected to be completed until 2029, Southern Company faces a multi-year capital commitment that could strain liquidity and financial flexibility, especially considering the existing $1.245 billion exposure already recorded.

At December 31, 2024, consolidated retained earnings included $6.5 billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.\n\nSee Note 7 under \"Southern Power\" for information regarding the distribution requirements for certain Southern Power subsidiaries.\n\nBy regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, up to its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2024, the amount of Southern Company Gas' subsidiary retained earnings available for dividend payment totaled $1.6 billion.\n\n## Structural Considerations\n\nSince Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies, the right of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas and, hence, the right of creditors of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas to participate in any distribution of the assets of any respective subsidiary of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas, whether upon liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of such subsidiary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas Capital was established to provide for certain of Southern Company Gas' ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt, hybrid securities, and other financing arrangements. Southern Company Gas fully and unconditionally guarantees all debt issued by Southern Company Gas Capital. Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern Company Gas Capital for its financing needs.\n\nSouthern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loan, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangement are unsecured senior indebtedness, which rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Company. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under any of these unsecured senior debt arrangements, which are effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of creditors of Southern Power's subsidiaries.\n\n## 9.

At December 31, 2024, consolidated retained earnings included $6.5 billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.\n\nSee Note 7 under \"Southern Power\" for information regarding the distribution requirements for certain Southern Power subsidiaries.\n\nBy regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, up to its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2024, the amount of Southern Company Gas' subsidiary retained earnings available for dividend payment totaled $1.6 billion.\n\n## Structural Considerations\n\nSince Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies, the right of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas and, hence, the right of creditors of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas to participate in any distribution of the assets of any respective subsidiary of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas, whether upon liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of such subsidiary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas Capital was established to provide for certain of Southern Company Gas' ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt, hybrid securities, and other financing arrangements. Southern Company Gas fully and unconditionally guarantees all debt issued by Southern Company Gas Capital. Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern Company Gas Capital for its financing needs.\n\nSouthern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loan, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangement are unsecured senior indebtedness, which rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Company. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under any of these unsecured senior debt arrangements, which are effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of creditors of Southern Power's subsidiaries.\n\n## 9. LEASES\n\n## Lessee\n\nThe Registrants recognize leases with a term of greater than 12 months on the balance sheet as lease obligations, representing the discounted future fixed payments due, along with ROU assets that will be amortized over the term of each lease.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "question": "How does the renaming of FPL Group Capital Inc to NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc in 2010 reconcile with the continued use of the FPL Group Capital name in debt instruments filed as exhibits in 2021 and 2022?",
      "answer": "The renaming of FPL Group Capital Inc to NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc occurred in 2010, yet the FPL Group Capital name continues to appear in legal filings and debt instruments dated as late as 2021 and 2022. This indicates that while the corporate name was officially changed over a decade ago, legacy naming conventions persist in legal and financial documentation, particularly in indentures and officer certificates related to long-term subordinated debt securities. This dual usage reflects the importance of maintaining continuity in legal agreements and financial instruments that span multiple corporate branding transitions.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's use of regulatory hedges for energy-related derivatives, including $2.0 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at the parent entity, align with the immaterial pre-tax effects and collateral requirements disclosed for these derivatives in the financial statement footnotes?",
      "answer": "Southern Company uses regulatory hedges to manage energy-related derivative exposures, particularly for fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities and later recognized in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used. This includes $2.0 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at the parent entity. These energy-related derivatives are accounted for under different methods, including regulatory hedges, which defer the income statement impact to align with cost recovery mechanisms. However, the financial statement footnotes disclose that the pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were immaterial for all years, and any potential collateral requirements related to credit-risk features were also deemed immaterial at year-end 2021. This suggests that while regulatory hedges are used extensively to manage exposure and stabilize costs, the derivatives not designated under this method have minimal financial impact, indicating a controlled exposure in non-hedged derivative activities.",

See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.\n\nEnergy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:\n\n- Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.\n- Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.\n- Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.\n\nSome energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.",

There was no weather derivatives impact for 2021.\n\nThe pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were immaterial for all other Registrants for all years presented.\n\n## Contingent Features\n\nSouthern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor the applicable Registrants, the fair value of interest rate and energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2021. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Following the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy, Gulf Power has continued participating in the Southern Company power pool; however, on December 21, 2021, NextEra Energy provided a 180-day notice of its intention to cease such participation.\n\nGenerally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. If collateral is required, fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2021, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial.

      "answer": "Southern Company acknowledges in its risk factors that cyber intrusions pose a material threat to the operation of nuclear power plants, which could lead to regulatory fines, operational shutdowns, or increased compliance costs. These risks are particularly relevant to Alabama Power and Georgia Power, which together operate six nuclear units. On the operational side, the document notes that nuclear units managed by Southern Nuclear accounted for 28% of Georgia Power's total KWH generation in 2021, underscoring their strategic and material role in the company\u2019s electricity production. This dual context highlights a tension: while nuclear power plants are a critical asset contributing significantly to the company's energy output, they are also exposed to high-impact risks like cyber threats that could disrupt operations, increase costs, or trigger regulatory scrutiny. The interplay between these perspectives suggests that Southern Company must balance the strategic value of nuclear generation with the growing complexity and cost of securing these facilities against evolving cyber threats.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's short-term debt structure for Nicor Gas in 2024 compare with the broader credit arrangement commitments outlined in the liquidity and capital resources section, particularly regarding the $700 million restricted credit facility expiring in 2029?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's Nicor Gas subsidiary had $172 million in notes payable outstanding as of December 31, 2024, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%, reflecting its portion of short-term debt within the broader Southern Company Gas segment. This short-term debt is part of a larger liquidity framework where Nicor Gas is the borrower under a $700 million credit arrangement expiring in 2029, specifically restricted for its working capital needs. This arrangement is nested within a $2.45 billion combined credit facility shared with Southern Power, which allows for flexible sublimits between entities. The $172 million in notes payable represents a portion of Nicor Gas\u2019s access to this $700 million allocation, highlighting how Southern Company structures its liquidity to support both operational and working capital requirements across subsidiaries while maintaining compliance with debt covenants limiting total leverage to 70% of capitalization.",

        "Hop 1: SO(page_224) \u2192 Total Notes Payable: Discloses $172 million in notes payable for Nicor Gas with a 4.6% weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2024.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "question": "How does Georgia Power's request to extend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 through at least December 31, 2035, relate to FP&L's 25% ownership stake in the unit, and what implications does this have for Southern Company's long-term asset management strategy as outlined in the joint ownership agreements?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power has requested to extend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 through at least December 31, 2035, as part of its 2025 Integrated Resource Plan filing with the Georgia PSC. This request indicates a strategic decision to maintain and potentially upgrade the unit for long-term reliability and compliance. FP&L holds a 25% ownership stake in Plant Scherer Unit 3, which aligns with Southern Company's broader joint ownership model where Georgia Power operates the plant on behalf of co-owners, including FP&L. This shared ownership structure, detailed in the joint facility agreements, implies that Georgia Power's operational decisions\u2014such as extending the life of the unit\u2014will impact all stakeholders, including FP&L. The long-term asset management strategy of Southern Company, therefore, must account for both regulatory approvals and the coordination of capital investments across co-owned assets to ensure alignment with compliance requirements and stakeholder interests.",

See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2023 IRP Update\" for additional information.\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034.\n\nThe 2025 IRP requests approval to pursue installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n\nAdditionally, the 2025 IRP requests upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033. Also, the 2025 IRP requests upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n\nThe 2025 IRP requests approval of investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n\nThe 2025 IRP also includes requests for RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n\nA decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2025 IRP is expected in July 2025. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2025 IRP\" for additional information.\n\n## Mississippi Power\n\nOn April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC did not note any deficiencies within the prescribed 120-day review period; therefore, the filing is concluded. The 2024 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs based on 50% ownership), all by the end of 2028, which is consistent with the completion of Mississippi Power's affiliate PPA with Georgia Power. On January 9, 2025, Mississippi Power notified the Mississippi PSC of its intent to extend the retirement date of Plant Daniel Unit 2 and potentially ex tend the retirement dates of other fossil steam units beyond their current 2028 retirement dates in order to serve recently signed economic development loads of approximately 600 MWs.\n\nOn November 8, 2024, Mississippi Power entered into an agreement with FP&amp;L to acquire FP&amp;L's 50% ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2. This acquisition will include a payment by FP&amp;L to Mississippi Power of between $35 million and $38 million, which represents an estimate of the incremental cost to Mississippi Power to assume ownership of FP&amp;L's interest, based on the timing of the completion of the transaction. On January 7, 2025, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's request for (i) the inclusion of the acquired assets and the associated costs at Plant Daniel in Mississippi Power's retail rate base, upon completion of the transaction, (ii) the establishment of a new regulatory liability account in which all of the proceeds to be paid by FP&amp;L will be recorded, and (iii) Mississippi Power's ability to amortize that regulatory liability by charging certain ex penditures against it. The completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, approval by the Florida PSC.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, Mississippi Power submitted its annual ECO Plan filing to the Mississippi PSC, which requested a $6 million annual increase in revenues.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting Mississippi Power's request for an $8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the MRA tariff, effective May 29, 2024, subject to refund. On December 23, 2024, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy filed a settlement agreement with the FERC. The settlement agreement provides for (i) a $1 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues and a refund to customers of approximately $4 million, (ii) a rate escalation of 2.5% on an annual basis in periods subsequent to December 31, 2024 and continuing through the end of the Shared Services Agreement (SSA) on December 31, 2035, and (iii) a waiver of rights by Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy to file for any changes in non-fuel rates through the end of the term of the SSA. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the FERC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

      "question": "How does the $177 million in storm recovery bonds issued by Duke Energy Progress in April 2024 relate to the formation and consolidation of DEPNC SF, and what does this imply about Duke Energy Progress' strategy for financing long-term storm-related regulatory assets?",
      "answer": "The $177 million in storm recovery bonds issued by Duke Energy Progress in April 2024 was facilitated through its special-purpose subsidiary, DEPSC SF, which is part of a broader structure that includes DEPNC SF. DEPNC SF was formed in 2021 and is consolidated by Duke Energy Progress as a VIE, due to its insufficient equity capitalization and Duke's control over its operations. This structure allows Duke Energy Progress to finance long-term storm-related regulatory assets\u2014specifically, those incurred from 2014 through 2022\u2014by securitizing them and collecting non-bypassable charges from retail customers over time. The use of VIEs like DEPNC SF and DEPSC SF enables Duke Energy Progress to isolate these assets and liabilities from its broader balance sheet, securing debt financing without recourse to the parent company. This reflects a strategic approach to managing regulatory assets and aligning storm cost recovery with long-term customer-funded mechanisms.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(page_152) \u2192 Storm Recovery Bonds: Duke Energy Progress filed a petition in May 2023 and issued $177 million in storm recovery bonds in April 2024 to finance storm-related costs from 2014\u20132022.",

The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

      "answer": "Southern Company's credit arrangement for Nicor Gas, detailed on page 223, includes a $700 million allocation under a multi-year credit facility expiring in 2029, specifically restricted for Nicor Gas's working capital needs. This facility allows for flexible adjustments in allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. The financial data on page 224 shows a significant decrease in Nicor Gas's short-term notes payable from $392 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024, with a corresponding weighted average interest rate drop from 5.5% to 4.6%. This suggests that Nicor Gas likely utilized the flexible credit facility to refinance or reduce its higher-cost short-term debt.

Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's use of storm recovery bonds to finance $1 billion in unrecovered storm costs relate to the company's strategic alignment with North Carolina House Bill 951, particularly in terms of balancing customer affordability with infrastructure modernization and clean energy transition goals?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy formed two special purpose entities (DECNCSF and DEPNCSF) in 2021 to issue $1.007 billion in storm recovery bonds, using the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property tied to costs from 2018 and 2019 storms. This property allows Duke to collect non-bypassable charges from retail customers to repay the bonds, creating a dedicated revenue stream without recourse to the parent company. This financial mechanism supports the company's broader capital investment strategy, as outlined in the context of North Carolina House Bill 951, which establishes modernized recovery mechanisms like multiyear rate plans to align infrastructure investments with clean energy goals. The legislation also sets a target of 70% carbon reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, while emphasizing affordability and reliability. By leveraging storm recovery bonds, Duke Energy can manage legacy storm costs in a way that preserves financial flexibility, enabling it to pursue its $63 billion capital plan focused on grid modernization, renewables expansion, and coal plant retirements\u2014all of which are consistent with the clean energy framework and recovery mechanisms introduced by the 2021 legislation.",

(DECNCSF) and Duke Energy Progress NC Storm Funding, LLC. (DEPNCSF) are bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\n\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $237 million and $770 million of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.

See 'Results of Operations' below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy's reportable business segments, as well as Other.\n\n## 2021 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments\n\nClean Energy Transformation . Our industry has been undergoing an incredible transformation and 2021 was a watershed year for our company where we executed on strategic priorities and delivered on our vision.\n\n## Coal Ash Settlement\n\nIn January 2021, we reached an agreement with the North Carolina Attorney General, the North Carolina Public Staff, and the Sierra Club on costs related to coal ash management and safe basin closure, resolving the last remaining major issues on coal ash management in North Carolina. This settlement is significant as it resolves pending issues in the multiyear coal ash basin closure debate in North Carolina, which is critical for paving the way toward our clean energy future. The agreement brought financial clarity to approximately $9 billion of mitigation costs, supporting coal ash cost recovery in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with a rate of return for the company. We agreed to reduce North Carolina customers' costs by approximately $1 billion, while maintaining our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals and our transition to cleaner energy. The settlement agreement resolved all coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues in connection with the 2019 rate cases filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with the NCUC, as well as the equitable sharing issue on remand from the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases.\n\n## Minority Interest Investment in Duke Energy Indiana\n\nIn a significant move to support the company's path to net-zero strategy, in September 2021 we completed the first phase of the investment of a 19.9% minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana by an affiliate of GIC, transferring 11.05% ownership interest in exchange for approximately $1.025 billion. The proceeds from the two-phase $2.05 billion investment are expected to partially fund the company's $63 billion capital and investment expenditure plan. This plan includes grid improvement, investments in clean energy and an improved customer experience - keys to our strategy to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation to net-zero by 2050.\n\n## North Carolina Energy Legislation\n\nIn October 2021, North Carolina House Bill 951 was signed into law after legislative leaders announced bipartisan support for and the General Assembly passed this new legislation. House Bill 951 reflects new state policy that would accelerate a clean energy transition for generation serving customers in the Carolinas, including providing a framework for a goal of 70% carbon reduction in electric generation in the state from 2005 levels by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for our customers, who are located in North Carolina and South Carolina. The legislation establishes a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO  emission reductions through the use of least cost planning, including stakeholder involvement, and also introduces modernized recovery mechanisms, including multiyear rate plans, that promote more efficient recovery of investments and align incentives between the company and the state's energy policy objectives. 2\n\n## Generating Cleaner Energy\n\nWe're targeting energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% by 2030 and a full exit by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals. We've made strong progress to date in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation (a 44% reduction from 2005) and have committed to do more (at least 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050). We've filed and refined comprehensive IRPs consistent with this strategy in multiple jurisdictions and updated the enterprise capital plan through 2026 to increase planned investments to $63 billion with over 80% of this capital plan funding investments in the grid and clean energy transition. The increased capital plan will allow us to accelerate coal plant retirements, make needed grid investments to enable renewables and energy storage, increase resiliency, and allow for dynamic power flows.\n\nOur commitment for 2030 includes retiring higher-emitting plants, operating our existing carbon-free resources and investing in renewables, our energy delivery system, and natural gas infrastructure. In 2021, we passed the milestone of 10,000 MW of solar and wind resources and plan to own or purchase 16,000 MW of renewables by 2025 and 24,000 MW by 2030. In June, we filed an application with the NRC to renew Oconee Nuclear Station's operating licenses for an additional 20 years and we intend to seek 20-year extensions and renewal of operating licenses for all 11 reactors. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development and deployment of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. That includes longer-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels.\n\n## Modernizing the Power Grid and Natural Gas Infrastructure\n\nOur grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding, helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for customers. We continue to expand our self-optimizing grid capabilities, and in 2021, smart, self-healing technologies helped to avoid more than 700,000 extended customer outages across our six-state electric service area, saving customers more than 1.2 million hours of lost outage time. We added 60 new self-healing networks in 2021 across our six-state service area and upgraded many existing systems to improve their smart capabilities and self-healing efficiency. Additionally, we expect to invest $100 million in electric vehicle charging over the next three years. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity into the business and we continue to leverage new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's financial obligation for coal ash basin closures under the 2024 CCR Rule relate to the expanded regulatory scope compared to the 2015 CCR Rule, and what does this imply about the long-term cost trajectory for managing previously unregulated coal ash sources?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy recorded asset retirement obligations (AROs) on its balance sheet for coal ash basin closures due to the 2024 CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by regulating inactive surface impoundments at retired facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources. The 2015 CCR Rule applied to active landfills and impoundments receiving coal combustion residuals (CCRs), but the 2024 Rule now includes legacy impoundments and other CCR management units that were previously unregulated. This expansion increases Duke Energy's compliance burden, as it now must address groundwater monitoring, corrective action, and potential closure for these newly regulated units. The company estimates that the total cost to permanently close all coal ash basins in North and South Carolina is between $8 billion and $9 billion, with approximately $4.4 billion already spent through 2024, and the majority of the remaining spend expected over the next 10 years. This implies a significant long-term cost trajectory driven by the expanded regulatory framework under the 2024 CCR Rule.",

In April 2024, the E P A issued the 2024 C C R  R ule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 C C R  R ule by establishing regulatory requirem ents for inactive surface im poundm ents at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. AR O s recorded on the D uke E nergy R egistrants' C onsolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these regulations and agreem ents.\n\nFor further inform ation, see N otes 4, 5 and 10 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters,\" \"C om m itm ents and C ontingencies\" and \"Asset R etirem ent O bligations.\"\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nDuke E nergy calculated an estim ated im pairm ent on the disposition of its C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups as of D ecem ber 31, 2022. T he im pairm ent was recorded to writedown the carrying am ount to fair value, less cost to sell. T he fair value was prim arily determ ined from  the incom e approach using discounted cash flows, but also considered m arket inform ation obtained through the bidding process. E stim ated future cash flows under the incom e approach were based on D uke E nergy's forecast, which was inform ed by existing power purchase agreem ents with offtakers and forward m erchant curves. Significant assum ptions used in the incom e approach include forward m erchant curves and discount rates. T he discount rates considered both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. D uke E nergy m onitored the sales of the C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups and recorded adjustm ents to the im pairm ents as warranted by progression in the disposition process and changes in m arket inform ation.\n\nThe actual losses for the C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups could differ from  the estim ated losses recorded as of D ecem ber 31, 2024, as the disposition process is finalized, but any differences are not expected to be m aterial.\n\nFor further inform ation, see N ote 2 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"D ispositions.\"\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RE SOURCE S\n\n## Sources and Uses of Cash\n\nDuke E nergy relies prim arily upon cash flows from  operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirem ents. D uke Energy's capital requirem ents arise prim arily from  capital and investm ent expenditures, repaying long-term  debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Additionally, due to its existing tax attributes and projected tax credits to be generated relating to the IR A, D uke E nergy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpayer until around 2030. In 2024, D uke Energy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress began recording nuclear P T C  deferred tax assets related to the IR A and began m onetizing the P T C s in the transferability m arkets established by the IR A beginning in O ctober 2024. D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress are working with the state utility com m issions on the appropriate regulatory process to pass the net realizable value back to custom ers over tim e. See N ote 24 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"Incom e T axes,\" for m ore inform ation.\n\nFrom  August through October 2024, a series of m ajor storm  events occurred that resulted in significant dam age to utility infrastructure within our service territories and prim arily im pacted D uke E nergy C arolinas', D uke E nergy P rogress' and D uke E nergy F lorida's electric utility operations. As discussed in N ote 4, to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"Regulatory M atters,\" hurricanes D ebby, H elene and M ilton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented dam age to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western N orth C arolina and upstate South C arolina. F unding restoration activities and, in som e cases, the com plete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this m agnitude has resulted in increm ental financing needs until cost recovery occurs.

T he federal regulation classifies C C R  as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of C C R  with som e restrictions. T he regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface im poundm ents receiving C C R  and existing surface im poundm ents located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving C C R  but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. T he rule established requirem ents regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater m onitoring and corrective action, closure requirem ents and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirem ents to ensure the safe disposal and m anagem ent of C C R .\n\nI n April 2024, the E P A issued the 2024 C C R  R ule which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 C C R  R ule by establishing regulatory requirem ents for inactive surface im poundm ents at retired generating facilities (Legacy C C R  Surface Im poundm ents). T he final rule also im poses a subset of the 2015 C C R  R ule's requirem ents, including groundwater monitoring, corrective action (where necessary), and in certain cases, closure, and post-closure care requirem ents, on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR M anagem ent U nits). C C R  M anagem ent U nits m ay include surface im poundm ents and landfills that closed prior to the effective date of the 2015 C C R  R ule, inactive C C R  landfills, and other areas where C C R  is m anaged directly on the land at D uke E nergy facilities. D uke E nergy, as part of a group of sim ilarly affected electric utilities, filed a petition to challenge the 2024 C C R  R ule in the U .S. C ourt of Appeals for the D istrict of C olum bia C ircuit (the C ourt) on August 6, 2024. O n F ebruary 13, 2025, the E P A requested the C ourt to withhold issuing an opinion and place the case in a 120-day abeyance to allow tim e for new E P A leadership to review the issues and the 2024 C C R  R ule and determ ine how they wish to proceed. On that sam e day, the C ourt granted E P A's m otion to hold the case in abeyance pending further order of the C ourt.\n\nI n addition to the requirem ents of the federal C C R  rules, C C R  landfills and surface im poundm ents will continue to be regulated by the states. C ost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the norm al ratem aking process with federal and state utility com m issions and via wholesale contracts, which perm it recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with D uke E nergy's regulated operations. F or m ore inform ation, see N otes 4 and 10 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters\" and \"Asset R etirem ent O bligations,\" respectively.\n\n## Coal Ash Act\n\nAROs recorded on the D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress C onsolidated Balance Sheets at D ecem ber 31, 2024, and D ecem ber 31, 2023, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the C oal Ash Act, the federal C C R  rules and other agreem ents. T he C oal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for com pliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the m anagem ent of C C R  and C C R  surface im poundm ents and prohibits cost recovery in custom er rates for unlawful discharge of ash im poundm ent waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The C oal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determ inations related to closure of ash im poundm ents to the norm al ratem aking processes before utility regulatory com m issions.\n\nOn Decem ber 31, 2019, D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress entered into a settlem ent agreem ent with N C D E Q  and certain com m unity groups under which D uke E nergy Carolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress agreed to excavate six of the nine rem aining coal ash basins with ash m oved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at M ayo, one at Roxboro, and two at R ogers. At the three rem aining basins at Belews C reek, M arshall and R oxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and m oved to lined landfills. T hose portions of the basins at Belews C reek, M arshall and R oxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which perm itted facilities were constructed, will be addressed as required under the 2024 C C R  R ule and state regulations.\n\nThe estim ated total cost to perm anently close all coal ash basins in N orth C arolina and South C arolina is estim ated to be approxim ately $8 billion to $9 billion of which approxim ately $4.4 billion has been spent through 2024. T he m ajority of the rem aining spend is prim arily expected to occur over the next 10 years. D uke E nergy has com pleted excavation of all coal ash at the R iverbend, D an R iver, Asheville and Sutton plants.\n\nFor further inform ation on coal ash basins and recovery, see N otes 4 and 10 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters\" and 'Asset R etirem ent O bligations,' respectively.\n\n## Other Environmental Regulations\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environm ental matters. D uke E nergy continues to com ply with enacted environm ental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants cannot predict the outcom e of these m atters.\n\n## Global Climate Change and R egulation of GH G E missions\n\nOn January 20, 2025, the new presidential adm inistration signed an executive order directing the U nited States to again withdraw from  the P aris Agreem ent and signed a letter to the United N ations notifying the world body of the planned withdrawal from  the P aris Agreem ent. T he withdrawal from  the P aris Agreem ent will becom e official one year after the subm ission of the letter. I n 2021, the previous presidential adm inistration had recom m itted to the P aris Agreem ent and announced a target of 50% to 52% reduction in econom ywide net GH G em issions from  2005 levels by 2030. T he U .S. subm ittal to support this P aris target included a goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. T hese actions were supplem ented by a num ber of executive orders and a num ber of proposed and final rules from  federal regulatory agencies, including the E P A, that would have im posed additional regulations on C O  and m ethane em issions which could im pact D uke E nergy. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants are m onitoring these m atters and any potential changes in com m itm ents, regulations or additional executive actions as a result of the new presidential adm inistration and cannot predict the outcom e, however, there could be a m aterial im pact on our energy transition. 2\n\n## EU&amp;I CO  Emissions Reductions 2\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' direct G H G  em issions consist prim arily of C O  that results prim arily from  operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants to serve its custom ers reliably and affordably. D uke E nergy is targeting at least a 50% reduction in carbon em issions from  2005 levels from  electric generation by 2030, an 80% reduction by 2040, and net-zero carbon em issions by 2050. In February 2022, Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 em issions, including em issions from  upstream  purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream  custom er use of natural gas, were added to our 2050 net-zero goal with an interim  goal of reducing these em issions by 50% below 2021 levels by 2035. 2",

T he rule established requirem ents regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater m onitoring and corrective action, closure requirem ents and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirem ents to ensure the safe disposal and m anagem ent of C C R .\n\nI n April 2024, the E P A issued the 2024 C C R  R ule which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 C C R  R ule by establishing regulatory requirem ents for inactive surface im poundm ents at retired generating facilities (Legacy C C R  Surface Im poundm ents). T he final rule also im poses a subset of the 2015 C C R  R ule's requirem ents, including groundwater monitoring, corrective action (where necessary), and in certain cases, closure, and post-closure care requirem ents, on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR M anagem ent U nits). C C R  M anagem ent U nits m ay include surface im poundm ents and landfills that closed prior to the effective date of the 2015 C C R  R ule, inactive C C R  landfills, and other areas where C C R  is m anaged directly on the land at D uke E nergy facilities. D uke E nergy, as part of a group of sim ilarly affected electric utilities, filed a petition to challenge the 2024 C C R  R ule in the U .S. C ourt of Appeals for the D istrict of C olum bia C ircuit (the C ourt) on August 6, 2024. O n F ebruary 13, 2025, the E P A requested the C ourt to withhold issuing an opinion and place the case in a 120-day abeyance to allow tim e for new E P A leadership to review the issues and the 2024 C C R  R ule and determ ine how they wish to proceed. On that sam e day, the C ourt granted E P A's m otion to hold the case in abeyance pending further order of the C ourt.\n\nI n addition to the requirem ents of the federal C C R  rules, C C R  landfills and surface im poundm ents will continue to be regulated by the states. C ost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the norm al ratem aking process with federal and state utility com m issions and via wholesale contracts, which perm it recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with D uke E nergy's regulated operations. F or m ore inform ation, see N otes 4 and 10 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters\" and \"Asset R etirem ent O bligations,\" respectively.\n\n## Coal Ash Act\n\nAROs recorded on the D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress C onsolidated Balance Sheets at D ecem ber 31, 2024, and D ecem ber 31, 2023, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the C oal Ash Act, the federal C C R  rules and other agreem ents. T he C oal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for com pliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the m anagem ent of C C R  and C C R  surface im poundm ents and prohibits cost recovery in custom er rates for unlawful discharge of ash im poundm ent waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The C oal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determ inations related to closure of ash im poundm ents to the norm al ratem aking processes before utility regulatory com m issions.\n\nOn Decem ber 31, 2019, D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress entered into a settlem ent agreem ent with N C D E Q  and certain com m unity groups under which D uke E nergy Carolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress agreed to excavate six of the nine rem aining coal ash basins with ash m oved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at M ayo, one at Roxboro, and two at R ogers. At the three rem aining basins at Belews C reek, M arshall and R oxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and m oved to lined landfills. T hose portions of the basins at Belews C reek, M arshall and R oxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which perm itted facilities were constructed, will be addressed as required under the 2024 C C R  R ule and state regulations.\n\nThe estim ated total cost to perm anently close all coal ash basins in N orth C arolina and South C arolina is estim ated to be approxim ately $8 billion to $9 billion of which approxim ately $4.4 billion has been spent through 2024. T he m ajority of the rem aining spend is prim arily expected to occur over the next 10 years. D uke E nergy has com pleted excavation of all coal ash at the R iverbend, D an R iver, Asheville and Sutton plants.\n\nFor further inform ation on coal ash basins and recovery, see N otes 4 and 10 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters\" and 'Asset R etirem ent O bligations,' respectively.\n\n## Other Environmental Regulations\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environm ental matters. D uke E nergy continues to com ply with enacted environm ental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants cannot predict the outcom e of these m atters.\n\n## Global Climate Change and R egulation of GH G E missions\n\nOn January 20, 2025, the new presidential adm inistration signed an executive order directing the U nited States to again withdraw from  the P aris Agreem ent and signed a letter to the United N ations notifying the world body of the planned withdrawal from  the P aris Agreem ent. T he withdrawal from  the P aris Agreem ent will becom e official one year after the subm ission of the letter. I n 2021, the previous presidential adm inistration had recom m itted to the P aris Agreem ent and announced a target of 50% to 52% reduction in econom ywide net GH G em issions from  2005 levels by 2030. T he U .S. subm ittal to support this P aris target included a goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. T hese actions were supplem ented by a num ber of executive orders and a num ber of proposed and final rules from  federal regulatory agencies, including the E P A, that would have im posed additional regulations on C O  and m ethane em issions which could im pact D uke E nergy. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants are m onitoring these m atters and any potential changes in com m itm ents, regulations or additional executive actions as a result of the new presidential adm inistration and cannot predict the outcom e, however, there could be a m aterial im pact on our energy transition. 2\n\n## EU&amp;I CO  Emissions Reductions 2\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' direct G H G  em issions consist prim arily of C O  that results prim arily from  operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants to serve its custom ers reliably and affordably. D uke E nergy is targeting at least a 50% reduction in carbon em issions from  2005 levels from  electric generation by 2030, an 80% reduction by 2040, and net-zero carbon em issions by 2050. In February 2022, Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 em issions, including em issions from  upstream  purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream  custom er use of natural gas, were added to our 2050 net-zero goal with an interim  goal of reducing these em issions by 50% below 2021 levels by 2035. 2",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's strategic request to extend the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond 2028, as outlined in the 2025 Integrated Resource Plan, align with SEGCO's current ownership structure and financial obligations, particularly regarding capacity payments and equity income distribution?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's 2025 IRP filing includes a request to extend the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034, despite SEGCO's current expectation of retiring these units by 2028. SEGCO, which is equally owned by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, operates these units and sells their capacity equally to both parent companies. In 2024, each company paid $118 million and $115 million respectively in capacity payments to SEGCO, which also distributed $20 million in dividends (50% to each owner). This strategic move to extend Plant Gaston's life suggests a shift in long-term resource planning, which must be reconciled with SEGCO's existing financial commitments and ownership dynamics, including ongoing operating cost allocations and return on equity expectations.",

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

Effective May 1, 2024, as approved under the Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is $8 million for Plant V ogtle Unit 4. See Note 2 under \"G eorgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters\" for additional information.\n\n## 7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a V IE. If a venture is a V IE for which a Registrant is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.\n\nFor entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $128 million and $126 million, respectively, primarily related to investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings/losses from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Retirement of SEGCO's generating units is currently expected to occur by December 31, 2028. However, Alabama Power, in conjunction with Georgia Power, is evaluating extending the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the indicated retirement date. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2025 IRP\" for additional information. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and an ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $115 million in 2024, $112 million in 2023, and $124 million in 2022 for Alabama Power and $118 million in 2024, $115 million in 2023, and $127 million in 2022 for G eorgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $20 million in 2024, $25 million in 2023, and $14 million in 2022, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the V IEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb ex pected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nSP Solar is owned by Southern Power and a limited partner. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest, and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns a 66% ownership interest. The",

      "question": "How does the legislative mandate from HB 951 requiring a 70% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions by 2030 in North Carolina influence Duke Energy's long-term generation planning strategy as outlined in their 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan filing, particularly in light of the state's economic development-driven load forecast increases?",
      "answer": "HB 951, passed by North Carolina, mandates a 70% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions from Duke Energy's generation in the state by 2030, with a path to carbon neutrality by 2050. This legislative requirement directly shapes Duke Energy's long-term planning process, culminating in the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan filing with the NCUC and PSCSC. In response, Duke Energy proposed Portfolio 3 as the most prudent path forward, aligning with the law by aiming to exit coal by 2035 and leveraging nuclear and energy storage extensions to maintain reliability during the transition. However, the filing also notes a 'substantially increased load forecast' due to economic development growth since the plan was prepared, indicating that the company must now seek additional resources beyond those initially identified. This dynamic underscores how HB 951\u2019s emissions targets are being operationalized through Duke Energy\u2019s strategic planning, even as evolving demand conditions in North Carolina\u2014where the company operates\u2014introduce complexity in meeting both reliability and regulatory mandates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(page_69) \u2192 HB 951: The legislation mandates a 70% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, with the NCUC required to develop a carbon plan and implement performance-based regulation.",
        "Hop 2: HB 951 \u2192 North Carolina: The state passed HB 951, which directly impacts Duke Energy\u2019s planning process by requiring alignment of its Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) with the emissions targets, leading to the development of the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy classifies debt investments as AFS (Available-for-Sale), which means unrealized gains and losses are generally recorded in other comprehensive income until realized, at which point they flow into net income. This policy, outlined in the broader Duke Energy investments section, applies to Duke Energy Indiana, which specifically reports its debt investments under this AFS classification. As a result, Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s portfolio is subject to this accounting treatment, deferring unrealized gains and losses to other comprehensive income, aligning with the company\u2019s consolidated reporting approach and regulatory deferral practices.",

      "answer": "The Reading wind project has a nameplate capacity of 200 MW and is operating under a 12-year PPA contract, which is significantly shorter than Southern Power's typical wind facility lifespan of up to 30 years. This discrepancy suggests that while the project contributes to near-term revenue, its limited contract duration may not fully capitalize on the long-term operational potential of wind assets, potentially affecting revenue sustainability beyond the 12-year term.",

The commercial paper program at Nicor Gas is structured to support its working capital requirements, as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates.

Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "question": "How does PowerSecure's $120 million revenue increase from distributed infrastructure projects reflect Southern Company's strategic emphasis on microgrid deployment across its diversified energy offerings?",
      "answer": "PowerSecure's $120 million revenue increase from distributed infrastructure projects (as reported in SO's 2024 financial results) directly supports Southern Company's strategic emphasis on deploying microgrids, which are explicitly called out as a core component of PowerSecure's business model. This alignment indicates that Southern Company is leveraging PowerSecure to advance its broader energy transition strategy by scaling distributed energy and resilience solutions. The consolidated financial statement notes further reinforce that microgrids are a central offering within PowerSecure\u2019s portfolio, suggesting that the significant revenue growth is not only a reflection of current market demand but also a deliberate execution of Southern Company\u2019s long-term diversification into modernized energy infrastructure.",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

However, in the segment reporting, distributed energy solutions are categorized under the 'All Other' column as a below-threshold segment, indicating that while the business activity is strategically recognized, it does not yet represent a major financial contributor relative to the core electricity and natural gas segments.

The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information.

      "answer": "NEE has provided guarantees totaling approximately $2.3 billion on behalf of NEP's subsidiaries, primarily related to project performance obligations and financing agreements. NEP, in which NEE holds a significant stake, owns or has partial ownership in a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets, including solar projects totaling approximately 10,118 MW of energy project capacity. NEE\u2019s planned capital expenditures include approximately $6,134 MW of new solar projects (including solar plus battery storage), indicating a strategic emphasis on expanding solar capacity. The guarantees highlight NEE\u2019s financial exposure and support for NEP\u2019s solar initiatives, aligning with NEE\u2019s broader capital allocation strategy focused on solar development.",

      "question": "How does the $24 million earnings impact from regulatory disallowances at Nicor Gas disclosed in the MD&A section reconcile with the $96 million pre-tax charge specifically attributed to Nicor Gas in the footnote disclosures?",
      "answer": "The $24 million figure mentioned in the MD&A section refers to the approximate earnings impact related to regulatory disallowances at Nicor Gas, reflecting a net effect after considering other factors. This aligns with the more detailed $96 million pre-tax charge disclosed in the footnotes under Nicor Gas operations, which represents the gross disallowance of certain capital investments. The difference between the two figures suggests that the $96 million charge was partially offset by other earnings drivers or tax adjustments, as implied by the MD&A's characterization of the disallowance as a partial offset to increased earnings. This synthesis across sections reveals a nuanced financial impact where the headline earnings effect is netted against other operational and regulatory developments.",

      "answer": "Southern Company acknowledges the critical role of nuclear power plants in its generation mix, with these facilities contributing 26% and 28% of total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power in 2021. Given this operational emphasis, the company also explicitly identifies physical attacks as a material risk to its nuclear facilities, citing the potential for environmental, safety, regulatory, and financial consequences. In response, Southern Company discloses that it implements robust security measures at these sites, though it concedes that all assets remain potentially vulnerable. The company further notes that physical attacks could lead to operational shutdowns, regulatory penalties, and costs exceeding insurance coverage, highlighting the tension between the strategic importance of nuclear generation and the growing threat landscape. This synthesis reveals that while nuclear power is central to the company\u2019s energy portfolio, it also represents a high-risk, high-value asset class requiring significant risk mitigation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Physical attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the Subsidiary Registrants to operate.\n\nThe Subsidiary Registrants face the risk of physical attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation and storage facilities and the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport energy, which could negatively impact their ability to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities, or, with respect to Southern Company Gas, its ability to distribute or store natural gas, or otherwise operate its facilities, in the most efficient manner or at all. In addition, physical attacks against third-party providers could have a similar effect on the Southern Company system.\n\nDespite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical attacks. If assets were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner, the affected Subsidiary Registrant may be unable to fulfill critical business functions. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses.\n\n## An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of, or inability to remotely access, one or more key technology systems, networks, or processes could impact the ability of the Registrants to operate.\n\nThe Subsidiary Registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of interconnected systems. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure and the technology systems' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, denial of service, ransomware, acts of war or terrorism, or other types of data security breaches, the Southern Company system faces a heightened risk of cyberattack. Cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments, have attacked and threatened to attack energy infrastructure. Various regulators have increasingly stressed that these attacks, including ransomware attacks, and attacks targeting utility systems and other critical infrastructure, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency.\n\nThe Registrants and their third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the Southern Company system, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks. However, the Registrants cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.\n\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, Southern Company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information about customers, employees, and stockholders, and other confidential information. In some cases, administration of certain functions may be outsourced to third-party service providers. Malicious actors may target these providers to disrupt the services they provide to the Registrants, or to use those third parties to attack the Registrants. The Registrants' third-party service providers could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to their systems.\n\nInternal or external cyber attacks may inhibit the affected Registrant's ability to fulfill critical business functions, including energy delivery service failures, compromise sensitive and other data, violate privacy laws, and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Any cyber breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the affected Registrant to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses. Additionally, the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing system protection measures are significant, and they could materially increase to address ever changing intense, complex, and sophisticated cyber risks.\n\n## The Southern Company system may not be able to obtain adequate natural gas, fuel supplies, and other resources required to operate the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's electric generating plants or serve Southern Company Gas' natural gas customers.\n\nSCS, on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, purchases fuel for the Southern Company system's generation fleet from a diverse set of suppliers. Southern Company Gas' primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Natural gas is delivered daily from different regions of the country. This daily supply is complemented by natural gas supplies stored in both company-owned and third party storage locations. To deliver this daily supply and stored natural gas, the Southern Company system has firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate pipelines. Disruption in the supply and/or delivery of fuel as a result of matters such as transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting fuel suppliers could limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs, and the ability of Southern Company Gas to serve its natural gas customers.\n\nThe Southern Company system is dependent upon natural gas as a fuel source for its power generation needs, which not only has the potential to impact the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's costs of generation but the costs",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

          "chunk_text": "\nIn 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $87 million, or 20.5%, as compared to 2023. The decrease primarily reflects a 30.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended in May 2023.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nIn 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $79 million, or 131.7%, as compared to 2023. The revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of 165.5% in the volume of KWH sales due to affiliated company energy needs.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC.",

The traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. In 2022, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) began service. SEEM, whose members include the traditional electric operating companies and many of the other electric service providers in the Southeast, is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. In July 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated certain FERC orders related to SEEM and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\nThe utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the max imum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions with third parties.\n\nSouthern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. See \"Regulation - Nuclear Regulation\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nSouthern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fix ed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with investorowned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW - \"Business Activities\" in Item 7 herein.\n\nSouthern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue power generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2024, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners, totaled 12,648 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,268 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries). See \"Traditional Electric Operating Companies\" herein for additional information on the Southern Company power pool.\n\nA majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling partner and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the partnerships. At December 31, 2024, Southern Power had eight tax equity partnership arrangements where the tax equity",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's net operating loss (NOL) carryforward benefit in Mississippi relate to its investment in SNG, and what does this imply about the strategic alignment between tax optimization and natural gas infrastructure exposure?",
      "answer": "Southern Company reports a $183 million net state income tax benefit from NOL carryforwards in Mississippi, where it has significant operations through Southern Power and Southern Company Gas. Southern Power operates in Mississippi and generates electricity from natural gas under long-term PPAs, while Southern Company Gas holds a 50% interest in SNG\u2014a major natural gas pipeline spanning 7,000 miles across multiple states including Mississippi. The NOL benefit in Mississippi directly supports the company's tax efficiency in a state where it maintains both power generation and gas infrastructure assets. This tax benefit aligns with Southern Company\u2019s strategic investment in SNG, which enhances natural gas supply diversification and supports long-term contracted energy services. The combination of tax optimization through NOLs and infrastructure investment through SNG illustrates a coordinated approach to managing both financial and operational exposure in the natural gas value chain.",

I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's use of tax-exempt bonds in Ohio relate to its pension cost obligations in that jurisdiction, and what does this imply about the company's capital structure and long-term liability management strategy?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy has $77 million in tax-exempt bonds outstanding under Duke Energy Ohio as of December 31, 2023, as disclosed in the long-term debt table. These bonds carry a favorable interest rate of 3.89%, which is lower than other debt instruments, indicating a strategic use of tax-exempt financing to reduce borrowing costs. Further, the company shows a $5 million service cost and a $13 million interest cost on projected benefit obligations in Ohio within its pension disclosures. This implies that while Duke Energy is leveraging tax-exempt bonds to finance operations, it is also managing significant pension liabilities in the same jurisdiction. The combination suggests a capital structure strategy that balances lower-cost debt with long-term employee benefit obligations, requiring careful liability management to maintain financial stability.",

      "question": "How does the $700 million working capital restriction in Southern Company Gas' credit arrangement with Nicor Gas relate to the 9.2% increase in taxes other than income taxes reported by Nicor Gas, particularly considering the covenant limitations on debt levels?",
      "answer": "The $700 million portion of Southern Company Gas' credit arrangement restricted for Nicor Gas' working capital needs is directly tied to its operational liquidity, including managing liabilities such as taxes. Nicor Gas reported a 9.2% increase in taxes other than income taxes in 2021, driven by higher natural gas revenues. However, the credit arrangement restricts this $700 million to working capital, which includes covering such tax expenses. The arrangement also imposes a debt covenant limiting Nicor Gas' debt to 70% of total capitalization, which could constrain its ability to take on additional debt to manage rising tax liabilities. Therefore, the working capital facility serves as a key liquidity source within the bounds of strict debt covenants, directly shaping Nicor Gas' capacity to address increased tax obligations without breaching its credit agreement.",

        "Hop 1: [SO](page_258) \u2192 [Credit Arrangement]: Southern Company Gas has a committed credit arrangement expiring in 2026, of which $700 million is specifically allocated to Nicor Gas for working capital needs.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's 2030 CO\u2082 emissions goal align with the North Carolina-mandated 70% reduction target under HB 951, given the prior rejection of Duke's accelerated coal retirement scenario by the PSCSC?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy has an internal 2030 CO\u2082 emissions reduction goal that aligns with the 70% reduction target mandated by North Carolina through HB 951. However, in 2021, the PSCSC rejected Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress' preferred accelerated coal retirement IRP scenario, instead favoring a base-case scenario without a CO\u2082 price. This regulatory pushback highlights the challenge of aligning corporate climate goals with state-mandated timelines, especially when regulators question the cost-effectiveness or feasibility of proposed strategies. Despite this, HB 951 required the NCUC to develop a carbon reduction plan by the end of 2022, which ultimately incorporated elements from Duke's IRP and informed the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan, particularly Portfolio 3, which outlines a path to exit coal by 2035 while balancing reliability and cost.",

      "question": "How does Georgia Power's 50% ownership and associated financial commitments to SEGCO influence its decision to seek an extension of Plant Gaston units through 2034 as part of the 2025 IRP?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power's 50% ownership in SEGCO, which operates Plant Gaston, comes with significant financial obligations, including equal shares of operating expenses, taxes, interest, and a return on equity. SEGCO's generating units at Plant Gaston have a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, with an initial expected retirement date of December 31, 2028. However, Georgia Power, alongside Alabama Power, is evaluating the extension of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond this date. In the 2025 IRP filing, Georgia Power specifically requested approval to operate Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. This extension request indicates a strategic alignment with SEGCO's long-term viability despite the shared financial burden. The decision likely reflects a cost-benefit analysis weighing the capital investment required to extend Plant Gaston's life against alternatives like new renewable or gas-fired generation proposed in the IRP. Without SEGCO's operational and financial structure, Georgia Power may have pursued different resource mix strategies.",

Effective May 1, 2024, as approved under the Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is $8 million for Plant V ogtle Unit 4. See Note 2 under \"G eorgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters\" for additional information.\n\n## 7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a V IE. If a venture is a V IE for which a Registrant is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.\n\nFor entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $128 million and $126 million, respectively, primarily related to investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings/losses from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Retirement of SEGCO's generating units is currently expected to occur by December 31, 2028. However, Alabama Power, in conjunction with Georgia Power, is evaluating extending the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the indicated retirement date. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2025 IRP\" for additional information. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and an ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $115 million in 2024, $112 million in 2023, and $124 million in 2022 for Alabama Power and $118 million in 2024, $115 million in 2023, and $127 million in 2022 for G eorgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $20 million in 2024, $25 million in 2023, and $14 million in 2022, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the V IEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb ex pected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nSP Solar is owned by Southern Power and a limited partner. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest, and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns a 66% ownership interest. The",

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy consistently classifies debt investments as AFS (Available-for-Sale) across both Duke Energy Carolinas (page 192) and Duke Energy Progress (page 194). This uniform accounting treatment means that unrealized gains and losses on these investments are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income, affecting how market risk is reflected in the financial statements. The fair value disclosures on page 192 show that both debt and equity investments are categorized using this classification framework, which allows for comparability between segments. However, since AFS classification delays the recognition of market fluctuations into earnings, analysts must look beyond the income statement to assess the true market risk exposure embedded in these portfolios. This consistent policy across segments simplifies cross-segment analysis but may obscure the immediate impact of market volatility on earnings.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy acknowledges the increasing risk of severe weather events linked to climate change and states its intent to continue seeking recovery of storm costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms (page 72). These mechanisms are further defined in the financial statements as part of alternative revenue programs, which include periodic adjustments for over or under-collection of related revenues (page 199 and 200). This indicates that the company's ability to recover unexpected storm-related expenses is partially contingent on the regulatory frameworks in place, which are designed to balance revenue discrepancies over time. Therefore, the alignment lies in the structured use of regulatory mechanisms as part of broader alternative revenue programs that provide a financial buffer and adjustment capability in response to unpredictable climate-related events.",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

The increase was primarily due to a net increase in revenues associated with new PPAs and a tax benefit due to changes in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in February 2021, partially offset by an increase in other operations and maintenance expenses primarily associated with scheduled outages and maintenance and a gain recorded in 2020 associated with the Roserock solar facility litigation.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

This local infrastructure is complemented by Southern Company Gas\u2019 50% ownership in SNG, a pipeline system that spans 7,000 miles and connects natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets including Tennessee. While the Tennessee operations reflect a localized distribution footprint, SNG provides upstream connectivity and supply diversification, ensuring reliable sourcing for end-use customers in Tennessee and other southeastern states.

      "answer": "Duke Energy Indiana holds $352 million in tax-exempt bonds, which typically offer lower interest rates due to their favorable tax treatment, reducing the company's overall cost of capital. This financing structure is particularly relevant in Indiana, which supplies coal with sulfur content between 0.5% and 4.0% for Duke Energy Indiana's operations. The sulfur content of the coal has direct implications for sulfur dioxide emissions, requiring the company to manage environmental controls and compliance with emission limitations. The use of tax-exempt bonds may help offset capital-intensive compliance costs and support the continued use of Indiana-sourced coal, which is essential for meeting regional generation needs while balancing environmental obligations. This alignment of financing and operational characteristics suggests a strategic approach to managing both cost and regulatory risk in a key fuel-sourcing region.",

This project, aimed at increasing pipeline capacity by 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, is subject to multiple regulatory conditions and is not expected to be completed until 2029. The need for FERC approval introduces uncertainty, as seen in Alabama Power's Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition, which also requires FERC approval and is subject to similar regulatory conditions. Given Southern Company Gas' 50% share of the SNG pipeline costs and the lengthy timelines often associated with regulatory approvals, Southern Company faces material execution risk that could delay capital deployment and impact future cash flows.",

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power.\n\n## Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity\n\nOn October 24, 2024, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. for a total purchase price of approximately $622 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. owns and operates the Lindsay Hill Generating Station, an approximately 855-MW combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Alabama Power will assume an existing power sales agreement under which the full output of the generating facility remains committed to a third party through April 2027. Upon expiration of the power sales agreement, Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with the Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC, as well as the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Renewable Generation Certificate\n\nThrough the issuance of a Renewable Generation Certificate (RGC), Alabama Power is authorized by the Alabama PSC to procure renewable capacity and energy and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. Under the original RGC, Alabama was authorized to procure up to 500 MWs of renewable capacity and energy. In June 2023, the Alabama PSC issued an order approving modifications to Alabama Power's RGC. The modifications authorized Alabama Power to procure an additional 2,400 MWs of renewable capacity and energy by June 14, 2029 and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. The modifications also increased the size of allowable renewable projects from 80 MWs to 200 MWs and increased the annual approval limit from 160 MWs to 400 MWs. Through December 31, 2024, Alabama Power has procured solar capacity totaling approximately 498 MWs under the RGC.\n\n## Rate RSE\n\nThe Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an \"A\" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey.\n\nAlabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 53.9% and 52.3%, respectively.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company structure PPA contracts for wind projects like Skookumchuck relative to the assets' expected useful life, and what might this indicate about their long-term asset management approach compared to other energy resources?",
      "answer": "Southern Company structures the PPA contract for the Skookumchuck wind project over a 20-year term, which is notably shorter than the 30-year useful life typically attributed to wind facilities. This suggests a potential misalignment between the contractual revenue horizon and the full operational lifespan of the asset, possibly indicating a strategy to secure long-term cash flow stability while retaining flexibility in later years. In contrast, Southern Company's gas facilities have a useful life of up to 50 years and solar up to 35 years, yet no contract durations for those resources are disclosed, implying potentially different management and monetization strategies for non-wind assets.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Mississippi Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Mississippi Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nMississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets - asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Mississippi Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's accounting treatment of unrealized losses on AFS debt investments differ between the Investment Trusts and other AFS securities, and what impact does this have on the recognition of these losses in earnings?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy treats unrealized losses on AFS debt investments differently depending on whether they are held in Investment Trusts or classified as other AFS securities. In the case of Investment Trusts, all unrealized losses on debt securities are recognized immediately in earnings due to the limited oversight Duke Energy has over the day-to-day management of these investments. In contrast, for other AFS securities, unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income until realized, unless a credit loss is identified, in which case the credit-related portion is recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, there were no material credit losses on other AFS securities, meaning those unrealized losses remained outside of earnings. This distinction highlights how the level of control over investment decisions directly affects the timing and recognition of unrealized losses in the income statement.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's consolidated financial reporting treatment of Southern Linc align with the dual role of Southern Linc in providing both internal digital wireless communications and external fiber optics services, particularly in light of affiliate transaction accounting policies?",
      "answer": "Southern Company accounts for Southern Linc under consolidated reporting, as stated on page 164, where it is listed as one of the direct and indirect subsidiaries whose financials are consolidated. Southern Linc is described as providing digital wireless communications for internal use by the Southern Company system and also marketing these services to the public, including fiber optics services within the Southeast. According to affiliate transaction policies outlined on page 164, services provided by Southern Linc to other subsidiaries are rendered at direct or allocated cost. This cost-based pricing reflects how Southern Linc serves both internal and external markets, with its internal role governed by formal accounting policies that ensure transactions are conducted at cost. This dual role suggests that while Southern Linc generates revenue from external customers through fiber optics services (as noted on page 64), its internal operations are tightly integrated into the broader Southern Company financial framework, with transactions governed by cost-based allocations rather than market pricing. This alignment ensures consistency in consolidated financial reporting while allowing Southern Linc to maintain a commercial presence in the fiber optics market.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How does NEE's capital expenditure commitment for solar projects, including solar plus battery storage totaling approximately 6,134 MW, relate to its financial guarantees and liabilities tied to NEP, given that NEE guarantees or provides indemnifications totaling approximately $2.3 billion on behalf of NEP's subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "NEE has committed significant capital expenditures for new solar projects, including solar plus battery storage projects totaling approximately 6,134 MW (page 108), indicating a strategic push into renewable energy infrastructure. These projects are likely connected to NEP, which is described as owning a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets including wind, solar, and battery storage projects with total energy project capacity of approximately 10,118 MW (page 11). NEE, through its subsidiaries, guarantees or provides indemnifications totaling approximately $2.3 billion on behalf of NEP\u2019s subsidiaries (page 96), which suggests that NEE is financially backing NEP\u2019s development and operation of these assets. This creates a direct link between NEE\u2019s capital investment in solar infrastructure and its exposure to NEP\u2019s financial obligations, particularly as NEP\u2019s portfolio includes projects that NEE has developed or constructed. Therefore, NEE\u2019s capital deployment in solar projects is closely tied to its contingent liabilities through guarantees supporting NEP\u2019s operations.",

These regulatory bodies influence the company's financial reporting by determining the rates Georgia Power can charge customers, which are based on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable return on invested capital. The company expects to recover these costs and investments through regulated rates; however, there is a risk that regulators may not approve full recovery, directly impacting financial line items such as regulatory assets and liabilities. This material consideration is detailed in Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements, which is referenced on page II-129 of the financial statement schedule, and forms part of the basis for the auditor's opinion on the financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

      "question": "Given the risks associated with microgrids highlighted in Southern Company's risk factors, how does the company's continued stake in PowerSecure align with its strategy to manage competitive and technological threats to its traditional electric business model?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's risk section on page 30 notes that microgrids, along with other distributed energy resources, pose a competitive threat by potentially reducing customer reliance on centralized power generation and altering cost recovery methods. Despite this risk, PowerSecure \u2014 a subsidiary that develops and deploys microgrids \u2014 was found to have a fair value exceeding its carrying amount during the 2023 impairment test, indicating that Southern Company maintains a strategic interest in this technology. This suggests that rather than viewing microgrids solely as a threat, Southern Company is positioning itself to capitalize on distributed energy trends by leveraging PowerSecure\u2019s capabilities, thereby transforming a potential disruption into a strategic opportunity.",

        "Hop 1: SO(page_30) \u2192 Microgrids: Microgrids are identified as a competitive and technological risk that could erode market share and reduce the value of traditional generation assets.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's contractual obligations with Dalton, as a co-owner of the Vogtle expansion project, create financial exposure to fluctuations in electricity sales performance that are influenced by customer usage and weather-adjusted KWH trends?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's contractual obligations with Dalton, as a co-owner of the Vogtle expansion project (evidenced by the Plant Vogtle Additional Units Ownership Participation Agreement and its amendments referenced on page 322), create financial exposure through shared capital investment and cost allocation tied to the facility's operation. This exposure is directly linked to electricity sales performance because Dalton relies on electricity generated by these jointly-owned facilities (as noted in hop2_evidence), and Southern Company's financials are sensitive to variations in electricity demand. Weather-adjusted KWH sales trends, such as the 0.7% increase in residential usage and 7.1% increase in commercial usage in 2023 (from page 78), directly influence the utilization and revenue generation of these facilities. If customer usage or weather patterns deviate from projections, it could affect the expected return on investment for the Vogtle expansion, thereby impacting Southern Company's financial performance due to its contractual obligations with Dalton and other co-owners.",

        "Hop 1: [SO](page_322) \u2192 [Dalton]: SO has contractual agreements with Dalton, including the Plant Alvin W. Vogtle Additional Units Ownership Participation Agreement and multiple amendments, indicating Dalton's co-ownership in key generation assets.",
        "Hop 2: [Dalton] \u2192 [Electricity]: Dalton relies on self-owned generation facilities, some jointly-owned with Georgia Power (a Southern Company subsidiary), for its electricity supply, making it dependent on these facilities' operational and financial performance.",
        "Hop 3: [Electricity] \u2190 [SO](page_78): SO's financial performance is directly influenced by electricity sales trends, including weather-adjusted KWH sales which increased across residential and commercial sectors in 2023, and these trends impact the revenue potential of jointly-owned generation facilities like Vogtle."

      "answer": "Southern Company's nuclear power plants, which are operated by Southern Nuclear, account for approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power respectively. These plants are subject to a range of operational risks, including cyber intrusions, which are explicitly called out in the Operational Risks section. Cyber intrusions could lead to increased compliance costs, potential fines, or even shutdowns of nuclear units by the NRC if security standards are not met. The financial impact of such events could be significant, especially since damages or decommissioning costs could exceed available insurance or decommissioning trusts. This creates a direct link between cybersecurity threats and the financial and operational viability of the nuclear power plants, which are critical to Southern Company\u2019s electricity generation portfolio.",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "The 131.7% increase in wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies in 2024 was primarily due to a 165.5% increase in the volume of KWH sales, driven by higher energy demand from affiliated companies. This revenue shift aligns with the IIC framework, which governs how power pool transactions are managed across Southern Company\u2019s integrated system. Under the IIC, SCS administers the coordinated operation of electric facilities, including centralized economic dispatch and the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues from power pool transactions. This structured coordination facilitates the internal reallocation of energy resources, directly influencing the volume and value of intercompany sales, and ensures that costs and revenues are shared according to predefined mechanisms. Therefore, the significant increase in affiliate revenues reflects both operational dynamics and the structured cost and revenue allocation under the IIC, as executed by SCS.",

The traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. In 2022, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) began service. SEEM, whose members include the traditional electric operating companies and many of the other electric service providers in the Southeast, is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. In July 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated certain FERC orders related to SEEM and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\nThe utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the max imum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions with third parties.\n\nSouthern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. See \"Regulation - Nuclear Regulation\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nSouthern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fix ed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with investorowned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW - \"Business Activities\" in Item 7 herein.\n\nSouthern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue power generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2024, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners, totaled 12,648 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,268 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries). See \"Traditional Electric Operating Companies\" herein for additional information on the Southern Company power pool.\n\nA majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling partner and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the partnerships. At December 31, 2024, Southern Power had eight tax equity partnership arrangements where the tax equity",

      "question": "How does Mississippi Power Company's status as a separate registrant in SO's 2024 10-K filing relate to its use of the reduced disclosure format, and what implications does this have for the transparency of its financial and governance reporting relative to The Southern Company's consolidated disclosures?",
      "answer": "Mississippi Power Company, as a separate registrant within The Southern Company's 2024 10-K filing, is subject to the reduced disclosure format specified in General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K, which allows it to provide less detailed reporting than would otherwise be required. This format applies because Mississippi Power meets the conditions outlined in General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b), and thus files separately but with reduced content. As a result, the company does not prepare or file an annual report or proxy statement with the SEC, nor does it send such materials to its sole shareholder, The Southern Company. This selective disclosure approach contrasts with the broader, consolidated reporting of The Southern Company, which includes more comprehensive financial and governance details. Consequently, while Mississippi Power remains a distinct reporting entity, its transparency is limited by the reduced disclosure format, potentially affecting stakeholders' ability to fully assess its financial health and governance structure independently.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(page_324) \u2192 Mississippi Power Company: Mississippi Power is a separate registrant that signs its own Form 10-K and does not prepare or file an annual report or proxy statement with the SEC, as it is not required to do so for its sole shareholder, The Southern Company.",
        "Hop 2: Mississippi Power Company \u2192 Reduced Disclosure Format: Mississippi Power qualifies under General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K and thus is permitted to file using the reduced disclosure format specified in General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d).",
        "Hop 3: Reduced Disclosure Format \u2190 SO(page_3): The reduced disclosure format is applied to multiple subsidiaries including Mississippi Power, and the combined 10-K filing is made separately by each registrant, with no cross-representations between them."

      "answer": "Southern Company explicitly highlights Southern Linc's provision of digital wireless communications as a key business activity on page 11, describing its role in serving both internal and public markets across the Southeast. However, in the MD&A section on page 65, Southern Company only broadly categorizes Southern Linc under 'Other Business Activities' without disclosing specific financial metrics such as revenue, EBITDA, or capital expenditures. This contrasts with the detailed financial performance data provided for other subsidiaries like Southern Company Gas, which includes specific figures for depreciation, impairment charges, and regulatory disallowances, and PowerSecure, which is mentioned in the context of distributed energy solutions. The lack of granular financial disclosure for Southern Linc raises questions about the transparency of its financial performance despite its strategic positioning in the company\u2019s business overview.",

      "answer": "SEGCO, jointly owned by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, operates under credit arrangements that include debt level covenants limiting debt to 65% of total capitalization. As of December 31, 2024, SEGCO was in compliance with these covenants, which is a prerequisite for maintaining access to liquidity under its credit facilities. A portion of SEGCO\u2019s unused credit capacity is allocated to provide liquidity support to the commercial paper programs of Southern Company\u2019s traditional electric operating companies. Therefore, SEGCO\u2019s continued compliance with its debt covenants ensures that this liquidity support remains intact, directly contributing to the financial flexibility of Alabama Power and Georgia Power in managing their short-term funding needs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(page_223) \u2192 Debt Level Covenants: Southern Company\u2019s subsidiaries, including SEGCO, are subject to credit arrangements that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, and SEGCO was in compliance as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Debt Level Covenants \u2192 SEGCO: SEGCO\u2019s compliance with these covenants ensures continued access to credit arrangements and liquidity support.",

The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries.

          "chunk_text": "claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO and other emissions, CCR, releases of regulated substances, alleged exposure to regulated substances, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 2\n\nCompliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Southern Company system. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, operational changes, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated and could adversely affect the Registrants if such costs cannot continue to be recovered on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas.\n\n## The Southern Company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals.\n\nConcern and activism about climate change continue to increase and, as a result, demand for energy conservation and sustainable assets could further increase. Additionally, costs associated with GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be significant.\n\nThe Southern Company system has robust processes for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks, including a scenario planning process that is used to inform resource planning decisions in the states in which the traditional electric operating companies operate. This process relies on information from internal and external sources, which may or may not be accurate in predicting future outcomes. Each year, the Southern Company system develops scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In 2021, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO  prices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of CO  emitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon. 2 2\n\nAdditional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG emitting economy. However, the ultimate impact will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, natural gas prices, the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies, the ability to recover costs through existing ratemaking provisions, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.\n\nBecause natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels, future carbon constraints, including, but not limited to, the imposition of a carbon tax, may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. However, such demand may be tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain situations, such as new construction. Additionally, efforts to electrify the transportation and building sectors may result in higher electric demand and negatively impact natural gas demand. Future GHG constraints, including those related to methane emissions, designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs to the Southern Company system and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas.\n\nSouthern Company has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continuing to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.\n\nSee MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters Global Climate Issues\" in Item 7 herein for additional information.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "Southern Company reports a $10 million approximate net state income tax benefit from NOL carryforwards in Florida, where it operates through Southern Power and Southern Company Gas. This tax benefit is part of a broader strategy that includes infrastructure investments such as its 50% interest in SNG, a major natural gas pipeline connecting supply basins to markets across several states, including Florida. The investment in SNG supports long-term contracted revenue streams and enables diverse natural gas supply access, which aligns with Southern Company\u2019s strategic use of tax benefits to optimize financial performance while expanding its gas distribution infrastructure. This implies a coordinated approach between tax planning and capital deployment in core operational states.",

      "answer": "Southern Company estimates the useful life of its wind facilities at up to 30 years, as stated in the asset overview on page 244. However, the Reading wind facility, located in Kansas and with a nameplate capacity of 200 MW, has a PPA contract duration of only 12 years, as disclosed on page 330. This mismatch between the asset's expected operational life and the length of the contracted revenue period raises questions about the long-term financial viability and revenue strategy for the Reading facility beyond the initial PPA term.",

This uniform treatment suggests a centralized financial reporting policy that applies consistent accounting standards across business segments, regardless of their specific operational contexts.

In contrast, the $96 million pre-tax charges disclosed on page 302 represent the gross financial impact of disallowed capital investments at Nicor Gas, before any offsetting factors are considered.

This arrangement provides Nicor Gas with access to flexible liquidity, which directly influences its ability to manage short-term obligations. Looking at Total Notes Payable, Nicor Gas reported $172 million in outstanding commercial paper at the end of 2024, down from $392 million in 2023, reflecting a significant reduction in short-term borrowings.

Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power).

      "answer": "Southern Company's $1,245 million investment in SNG (as disclosed on page 217) reflects its financial stake in the entity that provides critical natural gas transportation services to Southern Company subsidiaries through SCS. SCS, acting as an agent for entities like Georgia Power, relies on long-term interstate natural gas transportation agreements with SNG governed by FERC-regulated tariffs (as detailed on page 165). These agreements directly contributed to $203 million in transportation costs for Georgia Power and other subsidiaries in 2024. This shows that Southern Company\u2019s significant equity investment in SNG is functionally tied to essential infrastructure services that flow through SCS and directly impact the company\u2019s operating expenses via regulated cost structures.",

      "answer": "SEGCO, owned equally by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, and its retirement is expected by December 31, 2028, though there is an evaluation to extend operations. Southern Company consolidates SEGCO, and the decline in the reported value of electric generating units from $760 million in 2022 to $670 million in 2023 may reflect the impending retirement of these units or reduced valuation due to potential decommissioning liabilities. This decline aligns with SEGCO's uncertain future operations and the broader asset retirement planning reflected in the financial disclosures.",

      "answer": "The $96 million pre-tax charge from disallowed capital investments at Nicor Gas, disclosed on page 302, directly reduces Nicor Gas' retained earnings. According to page 107, Nicor Gas is restricted up to its retained earnings balance in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates, and it cannot make money pool loans to affiliates. This restriction, combined with the charge, limits Nicor Gas' ability to support affiliated entities financially. Furthermore, as disclosed in the financing note (II-178), Nicor Gas must obtain financing separately without credit support from affiliates, which increases its reliance on external capital markets. Therefore, the charge likely heightens Nicor Gas' need for external financing while constraining internal financial flexibility, creating a dual pressure on its capital structure.",

      "answer": "Southern Company provides liquidity support through committed bank credit arrangements for commercial paper programs used by its subsidiaries, including Nicor Gas, which had a $700 million allocation under the 2029 credit facility specifically for working capital needs. Nicor Gas, in turn, relies on this facility as it is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates for its short-term funding needs. At the same time, Nicor Gas has long-term communication tower leases with terms up to 16 years, some of which include renewal periods that extend the expected lease term. These lease obligations create ongoing financial commitments that must be managed within Nicor Gas' working capital framework, which is directly supported by the 2029 credit facility. Thus, the liquidity support for the commercial paper program indirectly underpins Nicor Gas' ability to manage its long-term lease liabilities and other operational expenses.",

Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

S ee \"Contracts that Contain a Lease\" herein for additional information.\n\nReal estate/land leases primarily consist of commercial real estate leases at Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Southern Company Gas and various land leases primarily associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power. The commercial real estate leases have remaining terms of up to 20 years while the land leases have remaining terms of up to 44 years, including renewal periods.\n\nCommunication towers are leased for the installation of equipment to provide cellular phone service to customers and to support the automated meter infrastructure programs at the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas. Communication tower leases have remaining terms of up to 16 years.\n\nRenewal options exist in many of the leases. The expected term used in calculating the lease obligation generally reflects only the noncancelable period of the lease unless it is considered reasonably certain that the lease will be ex tended. Land leases associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power and communication tower leases for automated meter infrastructure at Nicor Gas include renewal periods reasonably certain of exercise resulting in an expected lease term at least equal to the ex pected life of the renewable energy facilities and the automated meter infrastructure, respectively.\n\n## Contracts that Contain a Lease\n\nWhile not specifically structured as a lease, some of the PPAs at Alabama Power and Georgia Power are deemed to represent a lease of the underlying electric generating units when the terms of the PPA convey the right to control the use of the underlying assets. Amounts recorded for leases of electric generating units are generally based on the amount of scheduled capacity payments due over the remaining term of the PPA, which varies between three and 15 years. Georgia Power has several PPAs with Southern Power that Georgia Power accounts for as leases with a lease obligation of $893 million and $416 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amount paid for energy under these affiliate PPAs reflects a price that would be paid in an arm's-length transaction as reviewed and approved by both the Georgia PSC and the FERC. Amounts related to the affiliate PPAs are eliminated in consolidation for Southern Company.\n\n## Short-term Leases\n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Registrants generally recognize lease expense for these leases on a straightline basis over the lease term.",

      "question": "How does Mississippi Power Company's regulatory accounting treatment for rate regulation impact Southern Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures regarding regulatory assets and liabilities across its traditional electric operating companies?",
      "answer": "Mississippi Power Company, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, is subject to rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. This regulatory framework influences its financial reporting through the application of specialized accounting rules for rate regulation, which affects line items such as property, plant, and equipment, regulatory assets, and liabilities. Southern Company, in its consolidated financial statements, reflects these regulatory effects in accordance with GAAP, particularly for its traditional electric operating companies like Mississippi Power. The consolidated disclosures indicate that these entities are subject to regulation by state public service commissions and FERC, and their financial statements incorporate the impacts of rate regulation, including under and over-recovered revenues and deferred charges. This shows that Southern Company's consolidated disclosures are shaped by the regulatory accounting treatments of its subsidiaries, including Mississippi Power, which must align with both state and federal regulatory requirements.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Mississippi Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Mississippi Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nMississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets - asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Mississippi Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "question": "How does NEE's disclosure of collateral posting requirements tied to credit ratings downgrades reconcile with the treatment of nuclear decommissioning reserve funds as part of special use funds, particularly in terms of financial flexibility and risk exposure?",
      "answer": "NEE discloses that if its subsidiaries' credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, they could be required to post up to $2.4 billion in additional collateral (as of December 31, 2023), which could significantly constrain financial flexibility. These collateral requirements apply to derivative contracts and are tied to credit ratings, with certain protections already in place via credit facilities. Meanwhile, the nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are a component of special use funds, hold restricted assets for future decommissioning liabilities at Seabrook, Duane Arnold, and Point Bech. These funds are primarily invested in marketable securities and are marked to fair value, directly impacting other comprehensive income. The connection lies in the fact that both collateral obligations and decommissioning reserves are held within the broader category of 'special use funds' on NEE\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. However, while decommissioning funds are restricted for a specific long-term liability, collateral postings are contingent and variable based on credit conditions. This distinction reveals a dual-layered risk profile: one operational and market-linked (collateral), the other regulatory and long-term (decommissioning), both of which affect NEE\u2019s liquidity and financial flexibility in different ways.",

        "Hop 1: [NEE](page_86) \u2192 [Special Use Funds]: NEE discloses that special use funds include restricted cash and investments, such as nuclear decommissioning reserves, and are subject to fair value accounting, with derivative-related collateral posting requirements potentially reaching $2.4 billion in a ratings downgrade.",
        "Hop 2: [Special Use Funds] \u2192 [Nuclear Decommissioning Reserve Funds]: Nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are a subset of special use funds, holding restricted assets for future decommissioning liabilities and primarily invested in marketable securities marked to fair value.",
        "Hop 3: [Nuclear Decommissioning Reserve Funds] \u2190 [NEE](page_73): NEE reports that these funds are subject to regulatory oversight and are used to meet future decommissioning costs, with market adjustments flowing through other comprehensive income, highlighting long-term liability management."

This co-ownership model aligns with Duke\u2019s broader pattern of joint ownership arrangements involving NCEMC, as seen in other assets listed on Page 178. However, while Roxboro CC is positioned as a replacement for retiring coal units (also on Page 152), the Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) section notes that long-lived assets like Roxboro CC may carry indeterminate retirement obligations, which could complicate future liability recognition and cost recovery strategies tied to this new facility.",

      "answer": "The Chattanooga Gas pipeline replacement program, with an estimated total cost of $118 million, is being recovered through annual base rate reviews rather than through a dedicated rider mechanism like other Southern Company gas utilities. This is reflected in the relatively small regulatory asset balance of $4 million for Chattanooga Gas at the end of 2021, compared to $47 million for Atlanta Gas Light and $10 million for Virginia Natural Gas. The smaller balance suggests that Chattanooga Gas' recovery mechanism, tied to base rate reviews, results in more timely or proportionally consistent cost recovery relative to expenditures, unlike the rider-based mechanisms that may defer larger balances before adjustment. This aligns with the stated recovery approach for Chattanooga Gas and contrasts with the rider-based recovery seen in other utilities where larger balances accumulate before rate adjustments occur.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAtlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC.\n\nSee \"Rate Proceedings - Atlanta Gas Light\" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 18, 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024.\n\n## Chattanooga Gas\n\nIn June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.\n\n## Natural Gas Cost Recovery\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, the over recovered balance was $88 million, which was included in other regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.\n\n## Rate Proceedings\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.\n\nIn July 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of $37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.",

      "answer": "Southern Power reports a useful life of wind assets as up to 30 years, suggesting a long-term operational outlook for such facilities. However, the Glass Sands wind project, completed in November 2021, operates under a PPA with a contract period of only 12 years. This shorter-term agreement appears inconsistent with the asset's expected longevity, potentially signaling a strategic decision to prioritize near-to-mid-term revenue stability over long-term contractual commitments in certain markets.",

The Registrants also elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASC 842 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, the Registrants applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed.\n\n## Lessee\n\nAs lessee, the Registrants lease certain electric generating units (including renewable energy facilities), real estate/land, communication towers, railcars, and other equipment and vehicles.

Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $75 million in 2021, $67 million in 2020, and $93 million in 2019 for Alabama Power and $77 million in 2021, $69 million in 2020, and $95 million in 2019 for Georgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $14 million in 2021, $12 million in 2020, and $14 million in 2019, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nIn 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% limited partnership interest in SP Solar to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic). A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest in SP Solar and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns the remaining 66% ownership in SP Solar. SP Solar qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited partnership and the 33% limited partner does not have substantive kick-out rights against the general partner.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, SP Solar had total assets of $6.1 billion, total liabilities of $408 million and $387 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33% to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.\n\nIn 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind to three financial investors. Southern Power owns 100% of the Class B membership interests and the three financial investors own 100% of the Class A membership interests. SP Wind qualifies as a VIE since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not have substantive kick-out rights against Southern Power.",

      "answer": "Southern Power's investment in battery energy storage, including the Garland Solar Storage facility in Kern County, CA, with 88 MW nameplate capacity and a 20-year PPA, is part of a broader strategy to leverage federal tax credits such as ITCs and PTCs. These investments are structured to maximize tax equity partnerships, where partners take the majority of federal tax benefits, allowing Southern Power to monetize these incentives while reducing its own capital exposure. This aligns with the company's approach to managing operational risk under long-term PPAs, where fixed and variable costs are often passed through to customers via energy charges, and where the integration of storage enhances dispatchability and reliability of renewable energy output. Garland Solar Storage, as a co-located battery facility, supports this model by enabling better utilization of solar generation and optimizing revenue under long-term contracts.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "answer": "Mississippi Power qualifies for the reduced disclosure format under General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K because it meets the conditions specified in those instructions. This reduced format is available to subsidiaries that are not required to file annual reports with the SEC or provide annual reports to their sole shareholder. As noted in its signature section, Mississippi Power does not send an annual report or proxy statement to its parent company, Southern Company, and does not prepare such reports after filing its Form 10-K. This aligns with the governance structure where Mississippi Power operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary with limited standalone reporting obligations, reflecting a streamlined regulatory compliance model that supports its integrated role within the Southern Company system.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's legal challenge of the 2024 CCR Rule relate to the audit firm's assessment of revised coal ash remediation cash flow estimates, given the expansion of regulatory obligations from the 2015 CCR Rule?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy's legal challenge of the 2024 CCR Rule, filed in August 2024, reflects the company's attempt to resist the expanded regulatory obligations that apply to previously unregulated coal ash sources, such as inactive landfills and legacy surface impoundments. This expansion builds upon the 2015 CCR Rule, which already imposed requirements on active CCR units. The audit firm, Deloitte, identified revisions in coal ash remediation cash flow estimates resulting from the 2024 CCR Rule as a critical audit matter due to the significant management judgments and assumptions involved. The audit procedures specifically addressed the reasonableness of Duke Energy's interpretation of the 2024 CCR Rule\u2019s applicability and its impact on asset retirement obligations, which are expected to cost between $8 billion and $9 billion in total for coal ash basin closures, with $4.4 billion already spent by 2024. Thus, the legal challenge and audit scrutiny are connected through the financial and regulatory implications of the expanded rule.",

T he federal regulation classifies C C R  as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of C C R  with som e restrictions. T he regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface im poundm ents receiving C C R  and existing surface im poundm ents located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving C C R  but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. T he rule established requirem ents regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater m onitoring and corrective action, closure requirem ents and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirem ents to ensure the safe disposal and m anagem ent of C C R .\n\nI n April 2024, the E P A issued the 2024 C C R  R ule which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 C C R  R ule by establishing regulatory requirem ents for inactive surface im poundm ents at retired generating facilities (Legacy C C R  Surface Im poundm ents). T he final rule also im poses a subset of the 2015 C C R  R ule's requirem ents, including groundwater monitoring, corrective action (where necessary), and in certain cases, closure, and post-closure care requirem ents, on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR M anagem ent U nits). C C R  M anagem ent U nits m ay include surface im poundm ents and landfills that closed prior to the effective date of the 2015 C C R  R ule, inactive C C R  landfills, and other areas where C C R  is m anaged directly on the land at D uke E nergy facilities. D uke E nergy, as part of a group of sim ilarly affected electric utilities, filed a petition to challenge the 2024 C C R  R ule in the U .S. C ourt of Appeals for the D istrict of C olum bia C ircuit (the C ourt) on August 6, 2024. O n F ebruary 13, 2025, the E P A requested the C ourt to withhold issuing an opinion and place the case in a 120-day abeyance to allow tim e for new E P A leadership to review the issues and the 2024 C C R  R ule and determ ine how they wish to proceed. On that sam e day, the C ourt granted E P A's m otion to hold the case in abeyance pending further order of the C ourt.\n\nI n addition to the requirem ents of the federal C C R  rules, C C R  landfills and surface im poundm ents will continue to be regulated by the states. C ost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the norm al ratem aking process with federal and state utility com m issions and via wholesale contracts, which perm it recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with D uke E nergy's regulated operations.

T he C oal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for com pliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the m anagem ent of C C R  and C C R  surface im poundm ents and prohibits cost recovery in custom er rates for unlawful discharge of ash im poundm ent waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The C oal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determ inations related to closure of ash im poundm ents to the norm al ratem aking processes before utility regulatory com m issions.\n\nOn Decem ber 31, 2019, D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress entered into a settlem ent agreem ent with N C D E Q  and certain com m unity groups under which D uke E nergy Carolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress agreed to excavate six of the nine rem aining coal ash basins with ash m oved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at M ayo, one at Roxboro, and two at R ogers. At the three rem aining basins at Belews C reek, M arshall and R oxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and m oved to lined landfills. T hose portions of the basins at Belews C reek, M arshall and R oxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which perm itted facilities were constructed, will be addressed as required under the 2024 C C R  R ule and state regulations.\n\nThe estim ated total cost to perm anently close all coal ash basins in N orth C arolina and South C arolina is estim ated to be approxim ately $8 billion to $9 billion of which approxim ately $4.4 billion has been spent through 2024. T he m ajority of the rem aining spend is prim arily expected to occur over the next 10 years.

D uke E nergy continues to com ply with enacted environm ental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants cannot predict the outcom e of these m atters.\n\n## Global Climate Change and R egulation of GH G E missions\n\nOn January 20, 2025, the new presidential adm inistration signed an executive order directing the U nited States to again withdraw from  the P aris Agreem ent and signed a letter to the United N ations notifying the world body of the planned withdrawal from  the P aris Agreem ent. T he withdrawal from  the P aris Agreem ent will becom e official one year after the subm ission of the letter.

D uke E nergy is targeting at least a 50% reduction in carbon em issions from  2005 levels from  electric generation by 2030, an 80% reduction by 2040, and net-zero carbon em issions by 2050. In February 2022, Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 em issions, including em issions from  upstream  purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream  custom er use of natural gas, were added to our 2050 net-zero goal with an interim  goal of reducing these em issions by 50% below 2021 levels by 2035. 2",

      "answer": "SEGCO, being a Southern Company subsidiary subject to bank credit arrangements, must comply with debt level covenants that restrict its debt to 65% of total capitalization. This is a stricter threshold than that of Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Company Gas, and Nicor Gas, which are allowed to maintain debt up to 70% of total capitalization. The lower debt threshold for SEGCO limits its financial flexibility in leveraging capital for new power generation projects compared to other subsidiaries with higher debt thresholds. Additionally, SEGCO\u2019s compliance with these covenants and lack of recourse to Southern Power\u2019s project debt further constrain its ability to independently raise capital, making its project financing strategy more conservative and reliant on equity or non-recourse debt structures.",

      "answer": "The 20.0% increase in operating revenues at PowerSecure, primarily driven by distributed infrastructure projects, indicates strong top-line growth in this business area. However, despite this growth, Southern Company's segment reporting notes that the 'All Other' category\u2014which includes distributed energy and resilience solutions\u2014does not allocate operating expenses to business segments, and therefore, there is no detailed expense tracking at the segment level for these activities. This lack of expense transparency creates a challenge in assessing the profitability and efficiency of the distributed energy solutions that contributed significantly to the revenue growth at PowerSecure. The disconnect between the quantitative revenue performance and the qualitative lack of expense visibility suggests a potential gap in financial reporting granularity for evaluating the full financial impact of distributed energy solutions on Southern Company's operations.",

The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's segment reporting highlights distributed energy and resilience solutions as part of its 'All Other' category, indicating a strategic focus on deploying microgrids and energy solutions for commercial and utility customers. This strategic emphasis is directly reflected in PowerSecure's financial performance, as disclosed in the 'Other Business Activities' section, where operating revenues increased by $111 million (20.0%) in 2024, with $120 million of that increase attributed to distributed infrastructure projects. However, this growth came with a significant cost increase\u2014$82 million (15.8%) in cost of other sales\u2014also tied to those same projects.

The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's classification of debt investments as AFS securities reconcile with their treatment of unrealized losses on these investments, particularly given their reporting of fair value estimates for debt securities at Duke Energy Indiana?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy classifies debt investments, such as those held by Duke Energy Indiana, as AFS (Available-for-Sale) securities, which means unrealized gains and losses are generally recorded in other comprehensive income until realized. However, for AFS securities held within Investment Trusts, where the company lacks control over day-to-day management, unrealized losses are immediately recognized in earnings and deferred to regulatory accounts. This is in contrast to other AFS securities, where unrealized losses are only recognized in earnings if a credit loss is identified. Duke Energy Indiana specifically reports the fair value of its debt investments under the AFS classification, aligning with the broader accounting policy framework outlined in the document. This dual treatment reflects both regulatory alignment and the operational constraints Duke Energy faces regarding trust-held investments.",

      "answer": "The 0.4% decrease in weather-adjusted residential KWH sales in 2023 indicates that, after removing the influence of abnormal weather conditions using statistical models, there was a decline in actual customer electricity usage. This aligns with the discussion of how weather conditions influence customer consumption patterns, as Southern Company Gas notes that customer demand is largely a function of weather, especially during heating seasons. However, the company employs weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments to limit exposure to typical weather fluctuations. Despite these strategies, the decrease in weather-adjusted sales suggests that changes in customer behavior or economic factors still impacted consumption, revealing that while weather risk mitigation tools reduce variability, they do not fully offset shifts in underlying usage trends.",

      "answer": "The $121 million gain from the sale of Sequent reflects a significant financial benefit to Southern Company Gas from divesting the entity. Despite this sale, Chattanooga Gas continues to rely on Sequent for natural gas procurement through an asset management agreement that remains in place until 2025. This ongoing contractual relationship indicates that, although Sequent is no longer owned by Southern Company, it still plays a critical operational role in serving Chattanooga Gas\u2019s energy needs. The relatively small equity stake of $4 million that Chattanooga Gas holds in Sequent further underscores that the relationship is primarily transactional and contractually mandated rather than ownership-based, highlighting a strategic separation of financial ownership from operational dependency.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATION - \"Southern Company - Electricity Business - Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses\" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATION under \"Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses\" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2020 and 2021.\n\nSCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2022, SCS has contracted for 517 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 12 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their 2022 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications, emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plan\" and \"Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 13 years. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units. Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nChanges in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See \"Rate Matters - Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans\" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nAdvances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and lower prices for natural gas, which fluctuate over time. Demand increases in 2021 resulted in price increases and high volatility; however, absent unforeseen developments, forward prices are expected to decline over the next several years. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, from Sequent, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Despite the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, the Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas asset management agreements with Sequent remain in place and will expire on March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2025, respectively. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas",

      "question": "How does the 118 MW wind capacity from the Glass Sands project completed in November 2021 align with Southern Power's stated useful life of up to 35 years for wind assets, and what implications does this have for long-term capacity planning under the 12-year PPA contract period?",
      "answer": "The Glass Sands project, completed in November 2021, has a nameplate capacity of 118 MW and is contracted under a 12-year PPA. This project is part of Southern Power\u2019s broader wind energy portfolio, which the company reports has a useful life of up to 35 years. The discrepancy between the 12-year PPA term and the 35-year asset lifespan suggests that Southern Power may plan to extend or renegotiate the PPA beyond the initial term or seek alternative revenue streams for the remaining useful life of the asset. This dynamic highlights strategic considerations in long-term capacity planning and contract structuring for wind energy projects.",

This classification is consistent across business segments, as shown on page 194, where Duke Energy Progress also reports its debt investments under AFS with similar fair value disclosures. However, the specific fair value amounts and unrealized gains or losses may vary by segment, reflecting different investment portfolios and risk exposures.

      "answer": "Duke Energy's joint ownership of the Roxboro CC facility with NCEMC, where Duke owns approximately 1,135 MW and NCEMC owns 225 MW, directly affects its asset retirement obligations (AROs) and long-term cost recovery planning. Since the Roxboro CC project allows for the retirement of Roxboro's coal-fired units 1 and 4, Duke Energy must account for the AROs associated with these retired assets. However, because certain assets like transmission and distribution facilities have indeterminate lives, their AROs cannot yet be reasonably estimated, delaying liability recognition. Meanwhile, Duke Energy Progress has already pursued cost recovery for the Roxboro CC construction through a future rate case, estimating a $98 million 2029 retail revenue requirement in North Carolina, which implies a strategic alignment between asset retirement and new asset cost recovery through regulated rate mechanisms.",

      "answer": "Southern Company Gas operates in Illinois through its gas marketing services segment via SouthStar, which targets end-use customers in the state. Nicor Gas, also operating in Illinois, experienced a $96 million pre-tax charge due to the disallowance of certain capital investments. This financial impact suggests that regulatory decisions in Illinois, a key market for Southern Company Gas, can significantly affect profitability. The coexistence of both gas marketing (SouthStar) and distribution (Nicor Gas) operations in Illinois highlights the company's concentrated exposure to regulatory risk in this state, which could influence future investment and compliance strategies.",

This financing independence is further emphasized in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis section, where it is noted that Nicor Gas maintains its own commercial paper program and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. On page 302, Nicor Gas is shown to have incurred $96 million in pre-tax charges due to the disallowance of certain capital investments, which directly impacts its retained earnings. Since retained earnings are the cap on affiliate transfers, this charge reduces Nicor Gas' ability to support Southern Company Gas financially, thereby increasing the subsidiary's relative financial risk exposure. This chain reveals a structural financial constraint that limits internal liquidity support within the Southern Company Gas group.",

      "answer": "Southern Power's Skookumchuck Wind project operates under a 20-year PPA contract (page_330), while the company's wind assets are reported to have a useful life of up to 30 years (page_244). This creates a 10-year gap beyond the PPA term during which the project may continue to operate but without guaranteed revenue. This mismatch introduces uncertainty in long-term cash flow projections for the Skookumchuck project, as revenue stability is assured only through the PPA period but the asset itself is expected to remain operational for a longer duration.

SEGCO's output is split equally between these subsidiaries and supports their generation capacity needs. Meanwhile, Southern Company also leases other electric generating units, including renewable energy facilities, as part of its broader asset strategy.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nFor entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $75 million in 2021, $67 million in 2020, and $93 million in 2019 for Alabama Power and $77 million in 2021, $69 million in 2020, and $95 million in 2019 for Georgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $14 million in 2021, $12 million in 2020, and $14 million in 2019, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nIn 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% limited partnership interest in SP Solar to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic). A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest in SP Solar and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns the remaining 66% ownership in SP Solar. SP Solar qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited partnership and the 33% limited partner does not have substantive kick-out rights against the general partner.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, SP Solar had total assets of $6.1 billion, total liabilities of $408 million and $387 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33% to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.\n\nIn 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind to three financial investors. Southern Power owns 100% of the Class B membership interests and the three financial investors own 100% of the Class A membership interests. SP Wind qualifies as a VIE since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not have substantive kick-out rights against Southern Power.",

The Registrants also elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASC 842 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, the Registrants applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed.\n\n## Lessee\n\nAs lessee, the Registrants lease certain electric generating units (including renewable energy facilities), real estate/land, communication towers, railcars, and other equipment and vehicles.

      "answer": "The $96 million pre-tax charge associated with regulatory disallowances at Nicor Gas, disclosed on page 302, reflects the total financial impact of disallowed capital investments. However, in the management discussion and analysis section, the earnings impact is noted to be approximately $24 million, indicating that only a portion of the disallowance directly affected current earnings, likely due to timing, regulatory recovery mechanisms, or adjustments in tax implications. This difference highlights how the financial statements report the gross charge, while the MD&A contextualizes its net impact on earnings, offering a more nuanced view of how regulatory disallowances affect both reported results and forward-looking earnings performance.",

In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 46% were with BBB+ to BBBor equivalent rated counterparties, and 6% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fix ed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 78,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. G as distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. SNG is developing a proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, which the operator of the joint venture anticipates will be completed by 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

      "answer": "Georgia Power Company is included in Southern Company's consolidated disclosures, where it accounts for $17 million of the total intrinsic value of stock options, indicating its material role in the consolidated entity's compensation structure. Despite this materiality, Georgia Power Company itself qualifies for the reduced disclosure format under General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K, which allows certain majority-owned subsidiaries to omit certain disclosures otherwise required of registrants. This reconciliation is possible because the reduced disclosure Format applies at the individual registrant level, and Georgia Power Company meets the conditions outlined in General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b). Therefore, while Georgia Power\u2019s stock option data is material enough to be included in the consolidated Southern Company disclosures, it is not required to provide the same depth of standalone disclosure due to its status as a qualifying subsidiary. This reflects a regulatory design that permits scaled-back reporting for subsidiaries whose financials are fully incorporated into a parent company\u2019s filings.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's reliance on SCS for centralized power pool coordination relate to the IIC's role in affiliate energy sales, particularly given the $77 million increase in wholesale affiliate revenues in 2021?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies participate in a coordinated power pool under the IIC, which is administered by SCS. The IIC facilitates affiliate energy sales based on marginal cost, and in 2021, wholesale revenues from these affiliate sales increased by $77 million, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. SCS provides centralized coordination and various administrative and operational services to Southern Company subsidiaries, including those involved in IIC transactions. This administrative and operational dependency on SCS enables the IIC-based energy sharing model, which directly contributed to the significant year-over-year increase in affiliate energy revenues. Thus, the $77 million increase in affiliate revenues is a result of both market conditions and the coordinated dispatch and administrative structure enabled by SCS under the IIC framework.",

Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to nonaffiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $77 million, or 69.4%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an $86 million increase associated with higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a $10 million decrease associated with lower KWH sales.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.\n\n## Energy Sales\n\nChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year.

          "chunk_text": "the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. In February 2021, Southern Company joined a filing at the FERC proposing a Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) that included many of the other electric service providers in the Southeast. In October 2021, the proposal became effective by operation of law following a tie vote by the FERC, subject to certain rehearing requests. A petition for appeal has been filed regarding the FERC's orders. SEEM is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants will use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. SEEM is expected to begin service in mid-2022. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\nThe utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions with third parties. In connection with the sale of former subsidiary Gulf Power in January 2019, an appendix was added to the IIC setting forth terms and conditions governing Gulf Power's continued participation in the IIC for a defined transition period. On December 21, 2021, NextEra Energy provided a 180-day notice of its intention to leave the Southern Company power pool.\n\nSouthern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See \"Regulation - Nuclear Regulation\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nSouthern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW - \"Business Activities\" in Item 7 herein.\n\nSouthern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue natural gas and renewable generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2021, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners, totaled 12,446 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,066 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries).

During  the  preparation  of  NEE's  December  31,  2024  financial statements, it was determined that NextEra Energy Resources' investment in XPLR was OTTI as a result of a significant decline in trading price of XPLR's common units. The impairment reflected NEE's fair value analysis using the market approach and the observable trading price of XPLR's common units at December 31, 2024 of $17.80. When making the OTTI determination, NEE considered, among other things, the extent to which the publicly traded unit price was less than cost. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately $2.6 billion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately $1.8 billion, resulting in an impairment charge of $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax), which is recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024. In January 2025, XPLR announced a strategic repositioning, including suspension of the distribution to common unitholders for an indefinite period. This has resulted in the trading price of X PLR's common units to trade below the December 31, 2024 trading price. Should NEE determine, based on future analysis which includes the current and future trading prices of XPLR's common units, that an additional impairment is other-than-temporary , an impairment loss would be recorded, which would impact NEE's consolidated statement of income.\n\nDuring the preparation of NEE's September 30, 2023 financial statements, it was determined that NextEra Energy Resources' investment in X PLR was OTTI as a result of a significant decline in trading price of X PLR's common units during the final three trading days of the third quarter of 2023 following the announcement of a decrease in XPLR's distribution growth rate expectations. The impairment reflected NEE's fair value analysis using the market approach and the observable trading price of X PLR's common units at September 30, 2023 of $29.70. When making the OTTI determination, NEE considered, among other things, the extent to which the publicly traded unit price was less than cost. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately $4.2 billion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately $3.0 billion, resulting in an impairment charge of $1.2 billion ($0.9 billion after tax), which is recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, NextEra Energy Resources recorded an impairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax) related to an investment in M ountain V alley Pipeline, LLC (M ountain V alley Pipeline), which is reflected in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impairment reflected NextEra Energy Resources' fair value analysis based on the market approach and considered legal and regulatory challenges to the completion of construction and the resulting economic outlook for the pipeline. This impairment charge resulted in the complete write off of NextEra Energy Resources' equity method investment carrying",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

These compliance costs, which include expenditures related to air quality, CCR facilities, and potential GHG regulations, are expected to rise as the company works toward its 2030 GHG reduction target of a 50% decrease from 2007 levels and its long-term net-zero goal by 2050. The financial impact on commercial customers is twofold: first, regulated rate recoveries may lead to higher prices, reducing demand; second, commercial customers themselves face similar environmental pressures, which may further constrain their energy usage. This dual pressure could negatively affect Southern Company\u2019s revenue stability from this segment unless offset by strategic adjustments in pricing, service offerings, or demand-side management.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's accounting treatment of Alternative Revenue Programs align with its reliance on Regulatory Mechanisms for recovering storm-related costs, given the 24-month collection expectation embedded in its revenue recognition policy?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy recognizes revenue from Alternative Revenue Programs in the period they are earned, with the condition that these revenues are probable of recovery and expected to be collected within 24 months. These programs, which include regulatory mechanisms like decoupling, are designed to adjust for over- or under-collection of revenues due to fluctuations in customer usage or performance targets. Notably, in the context of climate-related risks, Duke Energy indicates it would seek recovery of storm costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms. This implies that certain storm cost recovery efforts may fall under the broader umbrella of Alternative Revenue Programs, provided they meet the 24-month collection window and regulatory approval criteria. The alignment lies in how Duke Energy integrates its revenue recognition policy with the regulatory frameworks it operates under, particularly when addressing unexpected operational costs like those from severe weather events.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "question": "How should analysts interpret Southern Company's dual financial relationship with SNG, where SCS arranges regulated natural gas transportation services from SNG while Southern Company Gas simultaneously earns equity returns from the same entity?",
      "answer": "Analysts should interpret Southern Company's dual relationship with SNG as a complex interdependency shaped by both operational obligations and strategic investment returns. SCS, acting as an agent for Southern Company's utilities, incurs transportation costs under long-term agreements with SNG that are governed by FERC-regulated tariffs (as noted in the combined notes on page 165). These agreements directly impact Southern Company's operational expenses. At the same time, Southern Company Gas earns equity method investment returns from SNG, which totaled $146 million in 2024 (as disclosed on page 217). This dual relationship suggests a financial structure where Southern Company both pays for essential natural gas infrastructure services and benefits from SNG's profitability through equity ownership, with regulatory oversight ensuring cost transparency and fairness in the transportation arrangements.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's regulatory restriction on dividend payments from Nicor Gas impact its ability to maintain consistent common stock dividend payouts to shareholders, given Nicor Gas's contribution to natural gas revenue growth?",
      "answer": "Southern Company faces a regulatory restriction that limits Nicor Gas from paying dividends or loans to affiliates, including Southern Company, based on its retained earnings balance. At December 31, 2021, $1.3 billion of Southern Company Gas' subsidiary retained earnings, including Nicor Gas, were restricted for dividend payments. This restriction could constrain Southern Company\u2019s ability to fund its common stock dividends, which have been consistently paid since 1948, including a $2.62 per share dividend in 2021. However, Nicor Gas contributed to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses due to higher natural gas revenues, which are passed through to customers and do not directly affect net income. Thus, while Nicor Gas contributes to revenue growth, its inability to provide direct dividend support introduces a structural constraint on Southern Company's dividend policy, requiring reliance on other subsidiaries or capital strategies to maintain shareholder payouts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [SO](page_87) \u2192 [Nicor Gas]: Nicor Gas contributed to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses due to higher natural gas revenues, indicating its role in Southern Company Gas' revenue growth.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020.

      "question": "How does Southern Company's $7M financial stake in Chattanooga Gas relate to the bad debt rider mechanism, considering the company's historically low uncollectible accounts averaging less than 1% of revenues?",
      "answer": "Southern Company maintains a $7M financial stake in Chattanooga Gas as of December 31, 2024, and Chattanooga Gas operates under a bad debt rider approved by the relevant regulatory body. This rider allows for the recovery or refund of differences between actual bad debt experience and the benchmark used in setting base rates. Despite this provision, Southern Company's uncollectible accounts have historically averaged less than 1% of revenues across all periods presented, suggesting a strong track record of credit management. The presence of the bad debt rider for Chattanooga Gas implies a regulatory safeguard to manage potential credit volatility, even though the company's actual bad debt levels have remained consistently low. This combination indicates that while Southern Company has effective credit control, it also leverages regulatory mechanisms to mitigate financial exposure.",

If circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.\n\nCredit risk ex posure at Nicor G as is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 14 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk ex posure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest ex posure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit ex posure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, and interest rates. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets (included in \"Other\" or shown separately as \"Risk Management Activities\") and are measured at fair value. See Note 13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and Southern Company Gas' bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are ex cluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the \"normal\" scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.\n\nThe Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nThe purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's 2022 goodwill impairment of PowerSecure relate to its deployment of microgrids, and what does this imply about the financial performance and strategic positioning of this business segment?",
      "answer": "Southern Company recorded a $119 million goodwill impairment for PowerSecure in 2022 due to declining macroeconomic conditions that reduced sales growth and estimated cash flows. PowerSecure, which develops distributed energy solutions and deploys microgrids, is positioned as a strategic component of Southern Company's broader business activities. However, the impairment suggests that despite the strategic emphasis on microgrids, the segment faced financial headwinds in 2022 that impacted its valuation. This contrast between strategic deployment and financial performance indicates a misalignment that may require further evaluation of the long-term viability or market conditions affecting the microgrid business.",

      "answer": "Although Duke Energy sold KO Transmission's pipeline facilities to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC on February 1, 2023, KO Transmission remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio and continues to be subject to FERC regulations. This means that while the physical assets were divested, Duke Energy's regulatory obligations under FERC\u2014particularly those related to cybersecurity\u2014remain intact for KO Transmission as a continuing entity under its ownership. The company still faces cybersecurity risks outlined in the risk factors section, which are heightened for entities operating in the energy sector due to the critical infrastructure they manage and increasing threats from cyberattacks. Therefore, the divestiture does not reduce Duke Energy\u2019s exposure to FERC cybersecurity compliance requirements through KO Transmission.",

      "question": "How does Georgia Power Company's eligibility for the reduced disclosure format under Form 10-K reconcile with its inclusion of complete standalone cash flow statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power Company qualifies for the reduced disclosure format specified in General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K because it meets the conditions outlined in General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b), which allows certain registrants to file with scaled disclosures. Despite this eligibility, the company still provides full standalone statements of cash flows for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. This suggests that while Georgia Power Company takes advantage of regulatory relief in disclosure requirements, it maintains transparency in financial reporting by including full financial statements rather than abbreviated formats. The reconciliation lies in the distinction between the regulatory eligibility for reduced disclosure and the company\u2019s choice to preserve detailed financial transparency.",

        "Hop 1: SO(page_3) \u2192 Conditions (REGULATORY_REQUIREMENT): Georgia Power Company meets the conditions for reduced disclosure under Form 10-K, allowing for a scaled reporting format.",

      "answer": "Southern Company invested $2 million in Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program in 2021, as part of a 7-year initiative to install 73 miles of new pipeline infrastructure. Despite selling Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas maintains asset management agreements with Sequent for both Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, with the Chattanooga Gas agreement extending through March 31, 2025. These contracts remain critical for natural gas procurement, transportation, and storage services that serve regulated utility customers, with Sequent's role in managing these commodity contracts previously involving Level 3 valuation inputs prior to its sale. This demonstrates how Southern Company continues to rely on Sequent's capabilities for gas supply management even after divesting ownership, while simultaneously investing in physical infrastructure upgrades at Chattanooga Gas.",

Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATION - \"Southern Company - Electricity Business - Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses\" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATION under \"Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses\" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2020 and 2021.\n\nSCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2022, SCS has contracted for 517 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 12 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their 2022 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications, emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plan\" and \"Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 13 years. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units. Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nChanges in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See \"Rate Matters - Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans\" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nAdvances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and lower prices for natural gas, which fluctuate over time. Demand increases in 2021 resulted in price increases and high volatility; however, absent unforeseen developments, forward prices are expected to decline over the next several years. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, from Sequent, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Despite the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, the Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas asset management agreements with Sequent remain in place and will expire on March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2025, respectively. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas",

The regulatory framework on page 22 indicates that environmental remediation costs are among the items eligible for cost recovery through regulatory riders. However, page 280 reveals that Southern Company Gas retains exposure to market volatility, particularly in energy-related commodity prices, which could materially affect its results of operations. This suggests that while the company may seek to recover environmental remediation costs through regulated rates, its ability to do so may be constrained by market risks that are not fully mitigated through existing hedging mechanisms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents                                Index  to Financial Statem ents\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC.\n\nIn addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms.\n\n## Integrated Resource Planning\n\nEach of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix  of resources to meet the ex isting and future demand requirements of its customers. In addition, each year the Southern Company system engages in a scenario planning process, developing scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In 2024, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO prices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of CO  emitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 7 herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies, as well as a discussion of the Southern Company system's continued generating fleet transition. 2 2\n\n## Alabama Power\n\nTriennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet ex pected customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs any new generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business. Alabama Power provided its most recent IRP to the Alabama PSC during 2022. On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nTriennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. In 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the G eorgia PSC, and certain intervenors. On January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP with the G eorgia PSC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" and \" - Rate Plans\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.",

S outhern Company Gas amortizes the fair value adjustments over the remaining lives of the respective bonds, the latest being through 2043.\n\nThe fair values are determined using Level 2 measurements and are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates available to the Registrants.\n\n## 14. DERIVATIVES\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency ex change rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these ex posures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis. See Note 13 for additional fair value information. In the statements of cash flows, any cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with the classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively. See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe Subsidiary Registrants enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to costbased rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-ex change-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-ex change-traded contracts are reflected in natural gas revenues.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company reconcile the regulatory risk associated with FERC approval for SNG's $3 billion pipeline project with its equity earnings of $146 million from SNG in 2024, especially considering the parallel regulatory uncertainty Alabama Power faces with its Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition requiring both Alabama PSC and FERC approval?",
      "answer": "Southern Company faces dual regulatory risks through its stake in SNG and its subsidiary Alabama Power, both of which are subject to FERC approval for major projects. SNG\u2019s proposed $3 billion pipeline expansion requires FERC approval, and Southern Company Gas holds a 50% stake in this project, which contributed $146 million in equity earnings in 2024. Meanwhile, Alabama Power\u2019s acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station also depends on FERC approval, alongside Alabama PSC authorization, with no assurance of a favorable outcome. While SNG\u2019s pipeline project is still in development with a planned 2029 completion, and Lindsay Hill is expected to close by Q3 2025, both projects represent significant capital investments that remain contingent on regulatory clearance. The company reports these risks separately and does not explicitly link them in its filings, suggesting that while both pose material uncertainties, they are managed as distinct regulatory challenges within the broader Southern Company system.",

Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power.\n\n## Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity\n\nOn October 24, 2024, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. for a total purchase price of approximately $622 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. owns and operates the Lindsay Hill Generating Station, an approximately 855-MW combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Alabama Power will assume an existing power sales agreement under which the full output of the generating facility remains committed to a third party through April 2027. Upon expiration of the power sales agreement, Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with the Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC, as well as the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Renewable Generation Certificate\n\nThrough the issuance of a Renewable Generation Certificate (RGC), Alabama Power is authorized by the Alabama PSC to procure renewable capacity and energy and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. Under the original RGC, Alabama was authorized to procure up to 500 MWs of renewable capacity and energy. In June 2023, the Alabama PSC issued an order approving modifications to Alabama Power's RGC. The modifications authorized Alabama Power to procure an additional 2,400 MWs of renewable capacity and energy by June 14, 2029 and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. The modifications also increased the size of allowable renewable projects from 80 MWs to 200 MWs and increased the annual approval limit from 160 MWs to 400 MWs. Through December 31, 2024, Alabama Power has procured solar capacity totaling approximately 498 MWs under the RGC.\n\n## Rate RSE\n\nThe Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an \"A\" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey.\n\nAlabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 53.9% and 52.3%, respectively.",

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's stake in the 72 MW Tranquillity Solar Storage project align with its broader strategy around battery energy storage tax credits?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's stake in the 72 MW Tranquillity Solar Storage project, completed in phases between November 2021 and March 2022, represents a concrete example of its investment in battery energy storage facilities. This aligns with the company's broader strategy to utilize federal tax credits\u2014specifically Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) and Production Tax Credits (PTCs)\u2014which are highlighted in the MD&A section. The company has $384 million in unutilized ITCs and PTCs tied to projects like battery energy storage facilities co-located with solar farms. Additionally, Southern Power has engaged in tax equity partnerships for such projects, allowing it to monetize these credits and improve financial performance. The Tranquillity project, therefore, is not only a physical asset contributing to energy storage capabilities but also a strategic vehicle for leveraging tax incentives to enhance cash flows and net income.",

The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "question": "What mechanisms does Southern Company use to manage credit risk associated with Nicor Gas' accounts receivable?",
      "answer": "Southern Company manages credit risk associated with Nicor Gas' accounts receivable through a combination of credit arrangements and regulatory mechanisms. First, Southern Company Gas has a $700 million credit allocation under a multi-year arrangement expiring in 2029, specifically restricted for working capital needs of Nicor Gas, which provides liquidity support for operational requirements, including receivables. Second, Nicor Gas operates under a Bad Debt Rider policy approved by the Illinois Commission, which allows for the recovery or refund of differences between actual bad debt experience and the benchmark bad debt expense used in setting base rates. This regulatory mechanism ensures that any variance in uncollectible accounts is passed through to customers, reducing the financial impact of credit risk on Nicor Gas. Together, these mechanisms provide both liquidity support and regulatory cost recovery to manage credit exposure related to accounts receivable.",

Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

If circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.\n\nCredit risk ex posure at Nicor G as is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 14 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk ex posure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest ex posure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit ex posure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, and interest rates. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets (included in \"Other\" or shown separately as \"Risk Management Activities\") and are measured at fair value. See Note 13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and Southern Company Gas' bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are ex cluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the \"normal\" scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.\n\nThe Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nThe purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation",

The auditor emphasized that Georgia Power\u2019s financial results are significantly influenced by the Georgia Public Service Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which determine the rates Georgia Power can charge customers and the timing of cost recovery. This regulatory framework introduces uncertainty regarding the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable return on invested capital. Therefore, any fluctuations in cash flows over the three-year period may reflect delays or denials in rate adjustments, as well as the timing and amount of recoverable costs approved by the commissions.

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

      "question": "How does Southern Power's investment in battery energy storage, including the specific deployment of the Tranquillity Solar Storage facility, align with its utilization of federal tax credits and long-term PPA structures to support cash flows and net income?",
      "answer": "Southern Power's investment in battery energy storage, including the 72 MW Tranquillity Solar Storage facility completed in Fresno County, CA, is part of a broader strategy to leverage federal tax credits such as ITCs and PTCs, which are projected to significantly impact cash flows and net income. These tax credits, with $384 million unutilized at Southern Power as of December 31, 2024, are often monetized through tax equity partnerships that provide upfront capital by transferring most of the tax benefits to equity partners. The long-term PPAs under which these storage facilities operate, typically spanning 15\u201320 years, ensure stable revenue streams tied to energy output and support the economic viability of these investments. This alignment between tax incentives and contracted revenue structures reflects a strategic integration of policy benefits and market commitments to optimize returns on renewable and storage assets.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's use of weather-normalized revenue mechanisms in its gas distribution segment reconcile with the reported decline in weather-adjusted electricity sales in its power operations, given the shared dependency of both businesses on weather conditions?",
      "answer": "Southern Company Gas utilizes weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in customer consumption patterns driven by weather fluctuations, particularly during the heating season. These mechanisms are designed to stabilize earnings despite variations in demand caused by temperature changes. In contrast, Southern Company's electric operations report weather-adjusted KWH sales that declined by 0.4% for residential customers in 2023, indicating lower usage independent of weather effects. This divergence suggests that while the gas segment actively mitigates weather risk through regulatory tools, the electric segment is experiencing underlying demand trends that are not fully offset by weather normalization, potentially signaling different customer behavior patterns or market dynamics between the two utility sectors.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's strategic emphasis on distributed energy solutions is highlighted in its segment reporting, where it notes that 'All Other' includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, such as providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids. PowerSecure, identified as a subsidiary that develops these solutions, contributed to a $120 million increase in operating revenues in 2024, primarily driven by distributed infrastructure projects. This aligns with the company's broader strategic direction while also demonstrating tangible financial performance improvements tied to this business line. However, the associated cost of other sales increased by $82 million at PowerSecure, indicating that while revenue growth is strong, it is accompanied by significant cost increases. This dynamic suggests that while distributed energy solutions are a growth area, they also present cost management challenges that could impact profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Development Projects\n\nIn November 2024, Southern Power committed to a development project to repower 200 MWs of the 299-MW Kay Wind facility located in Kay County, Oklahoma. The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants.

      "question": "How does Southern Company's revenue structure from PPAs, which include scheduled and variable lease payments, relate to its investment in wind facilities that qualify for PTCs, and what does this imply about the alignment of its financial incentives with renewable energy production?",
      "answer": "Southern Company discloses that PPAs, which include both scheduled and variable lease payments based on energy production, are a key component of its revenue structure, particularly for Southern Power and Alabama Power. These PPAs are directly tied to renewable energy facilities, including wind facilities. Southern Company invests in these wind facilities, which qualify for Production Tax Credits (PTCs) that apply during the first 10 years of energy production, significantly impacting Southern Power's cash flows and net income. The variable lease payments under PPAs are based on the amount of energy produced, which aligns with the PTCs that are also tied to energy output. This structure incentivizes both the production of renewable energy and the financial performance of the company through both tax credits and performance-based lease income. The connection between the PPA structure and the PTCs suggests a strategic alignment between regulatory incentives and Southern Company's operational and financial performance in wind energy.",

      "answer": "Georgia Power is set to recover $7.562 billion in construction and capital costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as approved under the Prudency Stipulation. However, this recovery is shared with the other Vogtle Owners\u2014Alabama Power, Mississippi Power, and MEAG Power\u2014under joint ownership agreements. Under the Global Amendments, Georgia Power assumed a disproportionate share of cost overruns, including $407 million in pre-tax charges through Q4 2022 and an additional $160 million in Q3 2023, which were not recoverable from retail customers. These charges stemmed from agreements with MEAG Power, OPC, and Dalton, where Georgia Power agreed to reimburse portions of their construction costs, totaling approximately $92 million for MEAG, $308 million for OPC, and $17 million for Dalton upfront, plus ongoing cost-sharing. Thus, while Georgia Power recovers a significant portion of its investment, its financial exposure extends beyond the recoverable amount due to its role as the lead owner under the cost-sharing framework, creating a misalignment between recoverable costs and actual financial burden.",

      "question": "How does the $177 million in storm recovery bonds issued by Duke Energy Progress in April 2024 relate to the formation and consolidation of DECNC SF, and what does this imply about Duke Energy\u2019s strategy for financing historical storm-related regulatory assets?",
      "answer": "The $177 million in storm recovery bonds issued by Duke Energy Progress in April 2024 was used to acquire storm recovery property from the company, which was created through state legislation and a PSC SC financing order to finance storm costs incurred from 2014 through 2022. This issuance was executed through DECSC SF, a bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary formed in 2024 for this specific purpose. DECNC SF, formed in 2021, is similarly structured and consolidated by Duke Energy Carolinas, indicating a consistent strategy of using special-purpose entities to securitize storm recovery costs. The formation and consolidation of these VIEs, including DECNC SF, reflect Duke Energy\u2019s broader approach to finance and recover historical storm-related regulatory assets through non-bypassable customer charges, with bondholders having no recourse to the parent companies.",

T he rate request before the N C U C  included an M YR P to recover projected capital investm ents during the three-year M YR P  period. In addition to the M YR P , the P BR  Application included an E arnings Sharing M echanism , R esidential Decoupling M echanism  and P IM S as required by H B 951.\n\nI n April 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress filed with the N C U C  a partial settlem ent with P ublic Staff, which included agreem ent on m any aspects of D uke E nergy P rogress' three-year M YR P proposal. In M ay 2023, C IG F U R  I I  joined this partial settlem ent and P ublic Staff and C I G F U R  I I  filed a separate settlem ent reaching agreem ent on P I M s, T racking M etrics and the Residential D ecoupling M echanism  under the P BR  application.\n\nOn August 18, 2023, the N C U C  issued an order approving D uke E nergy P rogress' P BR  application, as m odified by the partial settlem ents and the order, including an overall retail revenue increase of $233 m illion in Year 1, $126 m illion in Year 2 and $135 m illion in Year 3, for a com bined total of $494 m illion. Key aspects of the order include the approval of N orth Carolina retail rate base for the historic base case of approxim ately $12.2 billion and capital projects and related costs to be included in the three-year M YR P , including $3.5 billion (North C arolina retail allocation) projected to go in service over the M YR P  period. T he order established an R O E  of 9.8% based upon an equity ratio of 53% equity and approved, with certain adjustm ents, depreciation rates and the recovery of grid im provem ent plan costs and certain deferred C O VID -related costs. Additionally, the R esidential D ecoupling M echanism and P I M s were approved as requested under the P BR  Application and revised by the partial settlem ents. As a result of the order, D uke E nergy P rogress recognized pretax charges of $28 m illion within I m pairm ent of assets and other charges, which prim arily related to certain C O VID -19 deferred costs, and $8 m illion within O perations, m aintenance and other, for the year ended D ecem ber 31, 2023, on the C onsolidated Statem ents of O perations. D uke E nergy P rogress im plem ented interim  rates on June 1, 2023, and im plem ented revised Year 1 rates and the residential decoupling on O ctober 1, 2023.\n\nI n O ctober 2023, C I G F U R  I I  and H aywood E lectric M em bership C orporation each filed a N otice of Appeal of the August 18, 2023 N C U C  order. Both parties were appealing certain matters that do not im pact the overall revenue requirem ent in the rate case. Specifically, they appealed the interclass subsidy reduction percentage, and C IG F U R  II also appealed the Custom er Assistance P rogram  and the equal percentage fuel cost allocation m ethodology. O n N ovem ber 6, 2023, the AG O  filed a N otice of C ross Appeal of the N C U C 's determ ination regarding the exclusion of electric vehicle revenue from  the residential decoupling m echanism . On Novem ber 9, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress, the P ublic Staff, C IG F U R  I I , and a num ber of other parties reached a settlem ent pursuant to which C IG F U R  II agreed not to pursue its appeal of the C ustom er Assistance P rogram . In July 2024, the Suprem e C ourt of N orth Carolina consolidated the appeal with the parallel appeal of the N C U C 's order regarding the D uke E nergy C arolinas P BR  application. Briefing is com plete and oral argum ents occurred on February 13, 2025. D uke E nergy P rogress anticipates a decision to be issued no later than the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n## 2023 South Carolina Storm Securitization\n\nOn M ay 31, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress filed a petition with the P SC SC  requesting authorization for the financing of D uke E nergy P rogress' storm  recovery costs through securitization due to storm  recovery activities required as a result of the following storm s: P ax, U lysses, M atthew, F lorence, M ichael, D orian, Izzy and Jasper. O n Septem ber 8, 2023, Duke E nergy P rogress filed a com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent with all parties on all cost recovery issues raised in the storm  securitization proceeding.\n\nThe evidentiary hearing occurred in Septem ber 2023. O n Septem ber 20, 2023, the P SC SC  approved the com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent and on O ctober 13, 2023, the P SC SC issued its financing order. T he storm  recovery bonds of $177 m illion were issued by D uke E nergy P rogress in April 2024 and storm  recovery charges were effective M ay 1, 2024. See Notes 7 and 18 for m ore inform ation.\n\n## 2022 South Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn Septem ber 1, 2022, D uke E nergy P rogress filed an application with the P SC SC  to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. O n January 12, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress and the OR S, as well as other consum er, environm ental, and industrial intervening parties, filed a com prehensive Agreem ent and Stipulation of Settlem ent resolving all issues in the base rate proceeding. The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

D E C N C SF  and D E P N C SF  were form ed in 2021 while DECSCSF was form ed in 2024, all for the sole purpose of issuing storm  recovery bonds to finance certain of D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm  costs incurred in N orth C arolina and South C arolina.\n\nI n 2021, D E C N C SF  and D E P N C SF  issued senior secured bonds, and used the proceeds to acquire storm  recovery property from  D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress. The storm  recovery property was created by state legislation and N C U C  financing orders for the purpose of financing storm  costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. In April 2024, D E P SC SF issued $177 m illion of senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire storm  recovery property from  D uke E nergy P rogress. T he storm  recovery property was created by state legislation and a P SC SC  financing order for the purpose of financing storm  costs incurred from  2014 through 2022.\n\nThe storm  recovery property acquired includes the right to im pose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from  all D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' N orth Carolina and South C arolina retail custom ers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. T he storm  recovery bonds are secured by the storm  recovery property and cash collections from  the storm  recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. T he bondholders have no recourse to D uke E nergy Carolinas or D uke E nergy P rogress. T hese entities are considered VIE s prim arily because their equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations. D uke E nergy C arolinas and Duke E nergy P rogress have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE s as described above and therefore D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress are considered the prim ary beneficiaries. D uke E nergy C arolinas consolidates D E C N C SF  and D uke E nergy P rogress consolidates D E P N C SF  and D E P SC SF .\n\nThe following table sum m arizes the im pact of these VIE s on D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n",

      "question": "How does Georgia Power's financial exposure to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as outlined in the Vogtle Owners' cost-sharing agreements, reconcile with the Georgia PSC's approved prudency stipulation that limits recovery of construction costs to $7.562 billion?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power, as the majority owner among the Vogtle Owners, has assumed significant financial exposure through cost-sharing agreements that require it to reimburse portions of other owners' construction costs, including $308 million immediately to OPC and $17 million to Dalton, with additional commitments totaling approximately $105 million and $6 million respectively based on current forecasts. These charges, which are not recoverable from retail customers, contribute to the total project capital cost forecast. However, under the Georgia PSC-approved Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power is only allowed to recover up to $7.562 billion in total construction and capital costs, despite the total project likely exceeding this amount. This creates a financial tension where Georgia Power bears disproportionate risk through unrecoverable charges while being capped in its ability to recoup those costs through regulated rates, highlighting a misalignment between contractual obligations and regulatory cost recovery limits.",

        "Hop 1: SO(page_195) \u2192 Vogtle Owners: Vogtle Owners have a cost-sharing structure where Georgia Power assumes disproportionate financial exposure, including $308 million to OPC and $17 million to Dalton, with additional commitments based on forecasts.",

      "answer": "PowerSecure, a subsidiary of Southern Company, is specifically tasked with deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. In 2024, PowerSecure saw a $120 million increase in revenue tied to distributed infrastructure projects, which directly supports its core function in distributed energy solutions. This growth indicates a strategic emphasis on expanding microgrid deployment, aligning with Southern Company's broader vision of enhancing energy resilience and diversifying its offerings beyond traditional utility services. The increase in both revenue and cost of sales ($82 million) at PowerSecure further underscores the active investment and operational scaling in this business segment, reinforcing the company's commitment to distributed energy technologies.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

The increase reflects approx imately $17 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $14 million related to higher interest rates.

The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Other Business Activities\n\nSouthern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.\n\nA condensed statement of operations for Southern Company's other business activities follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's segment-level disclosure for Florida and Indiana regarding AFS debt investments relate to its general accounting policy that unrealized losses are only recognized in earnings when credit losses exist?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy's general accounting policy (page 184) states that unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt investments are included in other comprehensive income until realized, unless a credit loss exists, in which case the unrealized credit loss is included in earnings. The company also notes that there were no material credit losses as of December 31, 2023, and 2022. However, segment-level disclosures for Florida and Indiana (page 187) show that debt investments in these segments are classified as AFS, suggesting that unrealized losses could still be recognized in earnings if credit losses were identified. This creates a contrast between the company's general policy emphasizing credit loss recognition and segment-level disclosures that maintain the potential for such recognition despite the absence of material credit losses in 2023.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "Duke Energy Progress issued $177 million in storm recovery bonds in April 2024 to finance storm costs incurred from 2014 through 2022, as authorized by the PSC SC. These bonds were issued through DEPSC SF, a bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary formed in 2024 specifically for this purpose. DEPSC SF is consolidated by Duke Energy Progress because it is a variable interest entity (VIE) where Duke has the power to direct significant activities, despite bondholders having no recourse to the parent company. This structure allows Duke to recover storm-related regulatory assets through non-bypassable customer charges, while isolating the debt within a VIE. However, because Duke consolidates DEPSC SF, the balance sheet reflects the full financial obligation of the bonds, which could affect leverage ratios and regulatory outcomes in future rate cases.",

T he rate request before the N C U C  included an M YR P to recover projected capital investm ents during the three-year M YR P  period. In addition to the M YR P , the P BR  Application included an E arnings Sharing M echanism , R esidential Decoupling M echanism  and P IM S as required by H B 951.\n\nI n April 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress filed with the N C U C  a partial settlem ent with P ublic Staff, which included agreem ent on m any aspects of D uke E nergy P rogress' three-year M YR P proposal. In M ay 2023, C IG F U R  I I  joined this partial settlem ent and P ublic Staff and C I G F U R  I I  filed a separate settlem ent reaching agreem ent on P I M s, T racking M etrics and the Residential D ecoupling M echanism  under the P BR  application.\n\nOn August 18, 2023, the N C U C  issued an order approving D uke E nergy P rogress' P BR  application, as m odified by the partial settlem ents and the order, including an overall retail revenue increase of $233 m illion in Year 1, $126 m illion in Year 2 and $135 m illion in Year 3, for a com bined total of $494 m illion. Key aspects of the order include the approval of N orth Carolina retail rate base for the historic base case of approxim ately $12.2 billion and capital projects and related costs to be included in the three-year M YR P , including $3.5 billion (North C arolina retail allocation) projected to go in service over the M YR P  period. T he order established an R O E  of 9.8% based upon an equity ratio of 53% equity and approved, with certain adjustm ents, depreciation rates and the recovery of grid im provem ent plan costs and certain deferred C O VID -related costs. Additionally, the R esidential D ecoupling M echanism and P I M s were approved as requested under the P BR  Application and revised by the partial settlem ents. As a result of the order, D uke E nergy P rogress recognized pretax charges of $28 m illion within I m pairm ent of assets and other charges, which prim arily related to certain C O VID -19 deferred costs, and $8 m illion within O perations, m aintenance and other, for the year ended D ecem ber 31, 2023, on the C onsolidated Statem ents of O perations.

Both parties were appealing certain matters that do not im pact the overall revenue requirem ent in the rate case. Specifically, they appealed the interclass subsidy reduction percentage, and C IG F U R  II also appealed the Custom er Assistance P rogram  and the equal percentage fuel cost allocation m ethodology. O n N ovem ber 6, 2023, the AG O  filed a N otice of C ross Appeal of the N C U C 's determ ination regarding the exclusion of electric vehicle revenue from  the residential decoupling m echanism . On Novem ber 9, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress, the P ublic Staff, C IG F U R  I I , and a num ber of other parties reached a settlem ent pursuant to which C IG F U R  II agreed not to pursue its appeal of the C ustom er Assistance P rogram .

O n Septem ber 8, 2023, Duke E nergy P rogress filed a com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent with all parties on all cost recovery issues raised in the storm  securitization proceeding.\n\nThe evidentiary hearing occurred in Septem ber 2023. O n Septem ber 20, 2023, the P SC SC  approved the com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent and on O ctober 13, 2023, the P SC SC issued its financing order. T he storm  recovery bonds of $177 m illion were issued by D uke E nergy P rogress in April 2024 and storm  recovery charges were effective M ay 1, 2024.

O n January 12, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress and the OR S, as well as other consum er, environm ental, and industrial intervening parties, filed a com prehensive Agreem ent and Stipulation of Settlem ent resolving all issues in the base rate proceeding. The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How does the passage of North Carolina House Bill 951, which accelerates Duke Energy's clean energy transition, relate to the $1.007 billion in storm recovery property acquisitions by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in 2021, particularly in the context of balancing regulatory cost recovery with long-term capital investment strategy?",
      "answer": "North Carolina House Bill 951, signed into law in October 2021, establishes a framework for reducing carbon emissions and introduces modernized recovery mechanisms such as multiyear rate plans to align Duke Energy's investments with state energy policy goals. This legislative shift enables more efficient recovery of capital investments tied to the clean energy transition. Meanwhile, in November 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress used proceeds from storm recovery bonds\u2014$237 million and $770 million respectively\u2014to acquire storm recovery property totaling $1.007 billion. This acquisition was tied to unrecovered regulatory assets from storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. The connection lies in how Duke Energy leverages regulatory mechanisms (enabled by the new legislation) to recover past costs (via storm recovery bonds) while simultaneously advancing its long-term capital expenditure plan of $63 billion, which includes grid modernization and clean energy investments. The two approaches\u2014cost recovery through storm bonds and strategic investment under new legislative frameworks\u2014demonstrate Duke Energy's dual focus on regulatory alignment and financial sustainability in its transition to a cleaner energy future.",

          "chunk_text": "Duke Energy's 2021 Net Income Available to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) were impacted by favorable rate case outcomes and improved volumes offset by charges which management believes are not indicative of ongoing performance, including impairments related to workplace and workforce realignment and regulatory settlements. See 'Results of Operations' below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy's reportable business segments, as well as Other.\n\n## 2021 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments\n\nClean Energy Transformation . Our industry has been undergoing an incredible transformation and 2021 was a watershed year for our company where we executed on strategic priorities and delivered on our vision.\n\n## Coal Ash Settlement\n\nIn January 2021, we reached an agreement with the North Carolina Attorney General, the North Carolina Public Staff, and the Sierra Club on costs related to coal ash management and safe basin closure, resolving the last remaining major issues on coal ash management in North Carolina. This settlement is significant as it resolves pending issues in the multiyear coal ash basin closure debate in North Carolina, which is critical for paving the way toward our clean energy future. The agreement brought financial clarity to approximately $9 billion of mitigation costs, supporting coal ash cost recovery in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with a rate of return for the company. We agreed to reduce North Carolina customers' costs by approximately $1 billion, while maintaining our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals and our transition to cleaner energy. The settlement agreement resolved all coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues in connection with the 2019 rate cases filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with the NCUC, as well as the equitable sharing issue on remand from the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases.\n\n## Minority Interest Investment in Duke Energy Indiana\n\nIn a significant move to support the company's path to net-zero strategy, in September 2021 we completed the first phase of the investment of a 19.9% minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana by an affiliate of GIC, transferring 11.05% ownership interest in exchange for approximately $1.025 billion. The proceeds from the two-phase $2.05 billion investment are expected to partially fund the company's $63 billion capital and investment expenditure plan. This plan includes grid improvement, investments in clean energy and an improved customer experience - keys to our strategy to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation to net-zero by 2050.\n\n## North Carolina Energy Legislation\n\nIn October 2021, North Carolina House Bill 951 was signed into law after legislative leaders announced bipartisan support for and the General Assembly passed this new legislation. House Bill 951 reflects new state policy that would accelerate a clean energy transition for generation serving customers in the Carolinas, including providing a framework for a goal of 70% carbon reduction in electric generation in the state from 2005 levels by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for our customers, who are located in North Carolina and South Carolina. The legislation establishes a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO  emission reductions through the use of least cost planning, including stakeholder involvement, and also introduces modernized recovery mechanisms, including multiyear rate plans, that promote more efficient recovery of investments and align incentives between the company and the state's energy policy objectives. 2\n\n## Generating Cleaner Energy\n\nWe're targeting energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% by 2030 and a full exit by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals. We've made strong progress to date in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation (a 44% reduction from 2005) and have committed to do more (at least 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050). We've filed and refined comprehensive IRPs consistent with this strategy in multiple jurisdictions and updated the enterprise capital plan through 2026 to increase planned investments to $63 billion with over 80% of this capital plan funding investments in the grid and clean energy transition. The increased capital plan will allow us to accelerate coal plant retirements, make needed grid investments to enable renewables and energy storage, increase resiliency, and allow for dynamic power flows.\n\nOur commitment for 2030 includes retiring higher-emitting plants, operating our existing carbon-free resources and investing in renewables, our energy delivery system, and natural gas infrastructure. In 2021, we passed the milestone of 10,000 MW of solar and wind resources and plan to own or purchase 16,000 MW of renewables by 2025 and 24,000 MW by 2030. In June, we filed an application with the NRC to renew Oconee Nuclear Station's operating licenses for an additional 20 years and we intend to seek 20-year extensions and renewal of operating licenses for all 11 reactors. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development and deployment of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. That includes longer-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels.\n\n## Modernizing the Power Grid and Natural Gas Infrastructure\n\nOur grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding, helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for customers. We continue to expand our self-optimizing grid capabilities, and in 2021, smart, self-healing technologies helped to avoid more than 700,000 extended customer outages across our six-state electric service area, saving customers more than 1.2 million hours of lost outage time. We added 60 new self-healing networks in 2021 across our six-state service area and upgraded many existing systems to improve their smart capabilities and self-healing efficiency. Additionally, we expect to invest $100 million in electric vehicle charging over the next three years. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity into the business and we continue to leverage new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape.",

      "answer": "Southern Company discloses in its construction programs that SNG is developing a $3 billion pipeline project aimed at increasing capacity by 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, with a 2029 completion target contingent on regulatory approvals. Southern Company Gas holds a 50% stake in SNG, which reported $146 million in equity earnings for 2024. The timing of the project's completion in 2029 suggests that the current earnings from SNG are derived from existing operations, not the new pipeline, and the lack of guaranteed regulatory approvals introduces uncertainty about whether the project will contribute to future earnings.

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 46% were with BBB+ to BBBor equivalent rated counterparties, and 6% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fix ed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 78,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. G as distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. SNG is developing a proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, which the operator of the joint venture anticipates will be completed by 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

      "question": "How does Duke Energy Progress' use of DEPSC SF to issue $177 million in storm recovery bonds in 2024 align with the South Carolina regulatory approval and cost recovery mechanisms detailed in the 2023 storm securitization section?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy Progress formed DEPSC SF in 2024 as a special purpose subsidiary specifically to issue $177 million in senior secured storm recovery bonds, which were backed by non-bypassable customer charges. This financial structure aligns directly with the regulatory approval granted by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSC SC) in October 2023, following a comprehensive settlement agreement that authorized the securitization of storm recovery costs from storms spanning 2014 to 2022. The issuance of these bonds through DEPSC SF reflects a strategic alignment between Duke Energy Progress' financial instruments and the regulatory framework established to recover long-term storm-related costs from customers, while maintaining the separation of these obligations from the parent company\u2019s balance sheet.",

The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

      "answer": "Duke Energy references its joint ownership arrangements with NCEMC in the asset retirement obligations section, indicating that certain jointly owned assets have indeterminate lives, delaying the recognition of ARO liabilities. This context is critical when analyzing the Roxboro Plant CC Unit, where NCEMC intends to co-own approximately 225 MW of a proposed second unit. The regulatory implications of this co-ownership are reflected in the $113 million projected 2030 retail revenue requirement for North Carolina, which would likely influence future rate cases and regulatory asset treatment.

      "answer": "Duke Energy Carolinas formed DECNC SF in 2021 as a special purpose entity to issue storm recovery bonds to finance unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs incurred in North Carolina from 2018 to 2019. In 2023, Duke Energy Progress filed a separate storm securitization petition in South Carolina to recover costs from storms dating back to 2014, including storms like Pax, Matthew, Florence, and others. The South Carolina Public Service Commission approved a comprehensive settlement in September 2023, which led to the issuance of $177 million in storm recovery bonds in April 2024. This aligns with the broader corporate strategy of using special purpose entities like DECNC SF and DEPSC SF to securitize storm-related costs and recover them through non-bypassable customer charges, as described in both the consolidated balance sheet disclosures and the rate case proceedings.",

P ortions are included in rate base.\n\n## 2022 North Carolina Rate Case\n\nI n O ctober 2022, D uke E nergy P rogress filed a P BR  application with the N C U C  to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. T he rate request before the N C U C  included an M YR P to recover projected capital investm ents during the three-year M YR P  period. In addition to the M YR P , the P BR  Application included an E arnings Sharing M echanism , R esidential Decoupling M echanism  and P IM S as required by H B 951.\n\nI n April 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress filed with the N C U C  a partial settlem ent with P ublic Staff, which included agreem ent on m any aspects of D uke E nergy P rogress' three-year M YR P proposal. In M ay 2023, C IG F U R  I I  joined this partial settlem ent and P ublic Staff and C I G F U R  I I  filed a separate settlem ent reaching agreem ent on P I M s, T racking M etrics and the Residential D ecoupling M echanism  under the P BR  application.\n\nOn August 18, 2023, the N C U C  issued an order approving D uke E nergy P rogress' P BR  application, as m odified by the partial settlem ents and the order, including an overall retail revenue increase of $233 m illion in Year 1, $126 m illion in Year 2 and $135 m illion in Year 3, for a com bined total of $494 m illion. Key aspects of the order include the approval of N orth Carolina retail rate base for the historic base case of approxim ately $12.2 billion and capital projects and related costs to be included in the three-year M YR P , including $3.5 billion (North C arolina retail allocation) projected to go in service over the M YR P  period. T he order established an R O E  of 9.8% based upon an equity ratio of 53% equity and approved, with certain adjustm ents, depreciation rates and the recovery of grid im provem ent plan costs and certain deferred C O VID -related costs. Additionally, the R esidential D ecoupling M echanism and P I M s were approved as requested under the P BR  Application and revised by the partial settlem ents. As a result of the order, D uke E nergy P rogress recognized pretax charges of $28 m illion within I m pairm ent of assets and other charges, which prim arily related to certain C O VID -19 deferred costs, and $8 m illion within O perations, m aintenance and other, for the year ended D ecem ber 31, 2023, on the C onsolidated Statem ents of O perations. D uke E nergy P rogress im plem ented interim  rates on June 1, 2023, and im plem ented revised Year 1 rates and the residential decoupling on O ctober 1, 2023.\n\nI n O ctober 2023, C I G F U R  I I  and H aywood E lectric M em bership C orporation each filed a N otice of Appeal of the August 18, 2023 N C U C  order. Both parties were appealing certain matters that do not im pact the overall revenue requirem ent in the rate case. Specifically, they appealed the interclass subsidy reduction percentage, and C IG F U R  II also appealed the Custom er Assistance P rogram  and the equal percentage fuel cost allocation m ethodology. O n N ovem ber 6, 2023, the AG O  filed a N otice of C ross Appeal of the N C U C 's determ ination regarding the exclusion of electric vehicle revenue from  the residential decoupling m echanism . On Novem ber 9, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress, the P ublic Staff, C IG F U R  I I , and a num ber of other parties reached a settlem ent pursuant to which C IG F U R  II agreed not to pursue its appeal of the C ustom er Assistance P rogram . In July 2024, the Suprem e C ourt of N orth Carolina consolidated the appeal with the parallel appeal of the N C U C 's order regarding the D uke E nergy C arolinas P BR  application.

O n Septem ber 8, 2023, Duke E nergy P rogress filed a com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent with all parties on all cost recovery issues raised in the storm  securitization proceeding.\n\nThe evidentiary hearing occurred in Septem ber 2023. O n Septem ber 20, 2023, the P SC SC  approved the com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent and on O ctober 13, 2023, the P SC SC issued its financing order. T he storm  recovery bonds of $177 m illion were issued by D uke E nergy P rogress in April 2024 and storm  recovery charges were effective M ay 1, 2024. See Notes 7 and 18 for m ore inform ation.\n\n## 2022 South Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn Septem ber 1, 2022, D uke E nergy P rogress filed an application with the P SC SC  to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. O n January 12, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress and the OR S, as well as other consum er, environm ental, and industrial intervening parties, filed a com prehensive Agreem ent and Stipulation of Settlem ent resolving all issues in the base rate proceeding. The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy Ohio's use of tax-exempt bonds compare with the broader Duke Energy segment debt structure, particularly in light of its relatively low pension obligations?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy Ohio had only $5 million in service cost and $13 million in interest cost on projected benefit obligations in 2021, indicating relatively low pension liabilities compared to other Duke Energy segments. Meanwhile, Duke Energy Ohio disclosed holding $27 million in tax-exempt bonds as of December 31, 2023, which is a small portion of its total debt of $4,131 million. Across the broader Duke Energy corporation, tax-exempt bonds totaled $1,331 million, with Duke Energy Ohio representing just 2% of that total. This suggests Duke Energy Ohio relies more heavily on other forms of debt, such as first mortgage bonds ($2,300 million) rather than tax-exempt instruments, despite having lower pension-related financial pressures.",

      "answer": "The $96 million pre-tax charge from regulatory disallowances at Nicor Gas directly reduced Southern Company\u2019s earnings, as noted in the financial disclosures. This impact was partially offset by increased earnings from rate increases and infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. However, the MD&A section indicates that the regulatory disallowances still contributed to an approximate $24 million negative adjustment to earnings, demonstrating that while infrastructure investments and rate changes provided some earnings uplift, the disallowances had a measurable adverse effect on profitability.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's environmental compliance costs, as outlined in the regulatory and risk disclosures, could reduce demand from commercial and industrial customers due to higher energy prices passed through regulated rates. However, the company reported a 24.8% year-over-year revenue increase from commercial customers in 2023, primarily driven by distributed infrastructure projects at PowerSecure and commercial sales at Southern Linc. This apparent contradiction may be explained by the regulatory mechanisms in place\u2014such as the ECO Plan, ECCR tariff, and CNP Compliance\u2014which allow for the recovery of environmental compliance costs through retail and wholesale rates. These mechanisms may have enabled Southern Company to absorb or distribute the financial burden of compliance without fully passing it on to commercial customers, or alternatively, the growth in commercial revenue may reflect investments in new infrastructure and services that offset any demand reduction effects. The interplay between these regulatory cost recovery tools and strategic investments in commercial-facing assets suggests a nuanced balance between compliance pressures and revenue generation opportunities.",

      "question": "What does Southern Company's $119 million 2022 goodwill impairment of PowerSecure indicate about its capital allocation strategy for distributed energy solutions, particularly in light of continued infrastructure investments and the strategic positioning of PowerSecure as a key developer of these solutions?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's $119 million 2022 goodwill impairment of PowerSecure, as disclosed on page 175, signals a reevaluation of the financial performance and strategic value of its distributed energy solutions business. This impairment was driven by declining macroeconomic conditions that reduced sales growth and estimated cash flows, suggesting that the initial investment thesis behind PowerSecure's acquisition may have weakened. However, despite this impairment, Southern Company continued to make infrastructure investments in this business area, as noted on page 65, where PowerSecure is identified as a core component of 'other business activities' that provides distributed energy and resilience solutions. Furthermore, page 168 clarifies that PowerSecure actively develops these solutions, reinforcing its strategic role in Southern Company's broader portfolio. This juxtaposition indicates a complex capital allocation strategy where Southern Company maintains its commitment to the distributed energy space but may be recalibrating expectations and investment levels in response to market conditions.",

These transportation costs are explicitly included in the financial statements as part of operational expenses. Meanwhile, SCS provides services to Southern Company under power pool arrangements, which resulted in specific costs being capitalized or expensed in 2024.

      "answer": "NEE's pension plan has a target allocation of 20% to alternative investments, which includes limited partnerships as part of its diversified strategy to achieve a high rate of return with prudent risk. This aligns with NEE's broader investment approach, as evidenced by its noncontrolling interests in limited partnerships totaling $3,315 million at December 31, 2024, which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. While the pension plan uses limited partnerships to diversify risk and enhance returns within its asset allocation strategy, the company maintains noncontrolling interests in similar structures as part of its wider investment portfolio without consolidating these entities due to lack of control. This demonstrates a coordinated but distinct application of limited partnership investments across different financial contexts.",

NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not inv olv ed in the initial design of these entities and do not hav e a controlling financial interest in these entities.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in X PLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered V IEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE's investment in these entities totaled approximately $3,315 million and $3,913 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . A t December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $175 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 - Commitments and - Contracts, respectively.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to three land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to 34 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $372 million and $387 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $396 million and $412 million. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases totaled approximately $826 million and $840 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $440 million and $444 million. NEE's lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.83% and 3.96%, respectively , for operating leases and 4.92% and 4.32%, respectively , for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 44 years and 44 years, respectively , for operating leases and 33 years and 32 years, respectively , for finance leases. A t December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $2.6 billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. A t December 31, 2024, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2026 to 2044 and NEE expects to receive approximately $3.9 billion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the  power  sales  agreements  with  no  one  year  being  material.  Operating  and  sales-type  lease-related  amounts  were  not  material  to  NEE's  consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n\n## 11. Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset  retirement  costs  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  method  the  regulator  allows  for  recovery  in  rates.  See  Note  1  -  Rate  Regulation  and  Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's securitization of $1 billion in storm costs through storm recovery property align with North Carolina's regulatory framework and the financial obligations established in the November 2021 bond issuance?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy securitized approximately $1 billion in storm costs through the creation of storm recovery property, which was authorized under North Carolina legislation and NCUC financing orders to recover costs from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and other storms. This regulatory framework enabled Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to transfer the storm recovery property to special purpose entities (DECNCSF and DEPNCSF), which issued $237 million and $770 million in senior secured bonds, respectively, in November 2021. The proceeds from these bonds were used to finance the storm recovery property, which is secured by non-bypassable charges collected from retail customers over an 18- to 20-year period. This structure aligns with the NCUC\u2019s approval of the storm cost recovery mechanism and the performance-based regulation rules, ensuring that bondholders are repaid solely from storm recovery charges and not from the broader assets of Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress. Thus, the securitization reflects both regulatory support and a clear financial obligation framework tied to the bond issuance.",

The CCR Settlement Agreement resolves all coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues in connection with 2019 rate cases filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with the NCUC, as well as the equitable sharing issue on remand from the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases as a result of the December 11, 2020 North Carolina Supreme Court opinion. The settlement also provides clarity on coal ash cost recovery in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress through January 2030 and February 2030 (the \"Term\"), respectively.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed not to seek recovery of approximately $1 billion of systemwide deferred coal ash expenditures, but will retain the ability to earn a debt and equity return during the amortization period, which shall be five years under the 2019 North Carolina rate cases and will be set by the NCUC in future rate case proceedings. The equity return and the amortization period on deferred coal ash costs under the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases will remain unaffected. The equity return on deferred coal ash costs under the 2019 North Carolina rate cases and future rate cases in North Carolina will be set at 150 basis points lower than the authorized return on equity (ROE) then in effect, with a capital structure composed of 48% debt and 52% equity. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress retain the ability to earn a full WACC return during the deferral period, which is the period from when costs are incurred until they are recovered in rates.\n\nThe Settling Parties agreed that execution by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress of a settlement agreement between themselves and the NCDEQ dated December 31, 2019, (the 'DEQ Settlement') and the coal ash management plans included therein or subsequently approved by DEQ are reasonable and prudent. The Settling Parties retain the right to challenge the reasonableness and prudence of actions taken by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and costs incurred to implement the scope of work agreed upon in the DEQ Settlement, after February 1, 2020, and March 1, 2020, for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. The Settling Parties further agreed to waive rights through the Term to challenge the reasonableness or prudence of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' historical coal ash management practices, and to waive the right to assert any arguments that future coal ash costs, including financing costs, shall be shared between either company and customers through equitable sharing or any other rate base or return adjustment that shares the revenue requirement burden of coal ash costs not otherwise disallowed due to imprudence.\n\nThe Settling Parties agreed to a sharing arrangement for future coal ash insurance litigation proceeds between Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and North Carolina customers. For more information, see Note 4 \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\n\nAs a result of the CCR Settlement Agreement, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded a pretax charge of approximately $454 million and $494 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2020 to Impairment of assets and other charges and a reversal of approximately $50 million and $102 million, respectively, to Regulated electric operating revenues on the respective Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Coal Ash Settlement was approved without modification in the NCUC Orders in the 2019 rate cases on March 31, 2021, and April 16, 2021, for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. The NCUC issued an Order on Remand Accepting CCR Settlement and Affirming Previous Orders Settling Rates and Imposing Penalties in the 2017 rate cases on June 25, 2021.\n\n## Carbon Plan\n\nThe NCUC is required by North Carolina House Bill 951 (HB 951) to adopt an initial Carbon Plan on or before December 31, 2022. The NCUC has directed Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to file a proposed Carbon Plan on or before May 16, 2022. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n\n## Performance-Based Regulation Rules\n\nOn February 10, 2022, the NCUC adopted rules to govern the application and review process for the Performance-Based Regulation (PBR) authorized under HB 951. The PBR rules are constructive and consistent with the policy objectives of HB 951.\n\n## 2020 North Carolina Storm Securitization Filings\n\nOn October 26, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a joint petition with the NCUC, as agreed to in partial settlements reached in the 2019 North Carolina Rate Cases for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, seeking authorization for the financing of the costs of each utility's storm recovery activities required as a result of Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Dorian and Winter Storm Diego. Specifically, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress requested that the NCUC find that their storm recovery costs and related financing costs are appropriately financed by debt secured by storm recovery property, and that the commission issue financing orders by which each utility may accomplish such financing using a securitization structure. On January 27, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain accounting issues, including agreement to support an 18- to 20-year bond period. In the NCUC Orders in the 2019 rate cases issued on March 31, 2021, and April 16, 2021, for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively, the reasonableness and prudence of the deferred storm costs was approved. On May 20, 2021, the NCUC issued financing orders authorizing the companies to issue storm recovery bonds, subject to the terms of the financing orders, and approving the Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement in its entirety. The storm recovery bonds were issued by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress on November 24, 2021.",

      "answer": "The value of electric generating units at Plant Gaston, co-owned through SEGCO by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, declined from $1,028 million in 2022 to $760 million in 2023 at Georgia Power alone, signaling a significant asset depreciation. SEGCO, which owns these units, relies on payments from Alabama Power and Georgia Power to cover operating expenses, interest, and a return on equity. However, SEGCO itself had no short-term debt outstanding at the end of 2023 and faces a long-term debt maturity of an unspecified amount in November 2024. Given that SEGCO's financial health is tied to the performance and valuation of these generating units, the depreciation raises concerns about its ability to service the upcoming debt obligation, especially since its equity investors (Alabama Power and Georgia Power) are only indirectly exposed and may not be contractually obligated to cover shortfalls beyond their current payment arrangements.",

      "answer": "NextEra Energy recorded an impairment charge of $1.2 billion ($0.9 billion after tax) in the third quarter of 2023 and an additional impairment charge of $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax) in 2024 related to its investment in XPLR. Both impairments were determined using the market approach, based on the observable trading price of XPLR's common units at the time of assessment\u2014$29.70 per unit as of September 30, 2023, and $17.80 per unit as of December 31, 2024. The company considered the extent to which the trading price was below its carrying cost, and based on this analysis, concluded that the declines in value were other-than-temporary.",

The FERC regulations prohibit, among other investments, investments in any securities of NEE or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates, excluding investments tied to market indices or mutual funds. Similar restrictions applicable to the decommissioning funds for NEER's nuclear plants are included in the NRC operating licenses for those facilities or in NRC regulations applicable to NRC licensees not in cost-of-service environments. With respect to the decommissioning fund for Seabrook, decommissioning fund contributions and withdrawals are also regulated by the NDFC pursuant to New Hampshire law.\n\nThe nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are managed by investment managers who must comply with the guidelines of NEE and FPL and the rules of the applicable  regulatory  authorities.  The  funds'  assets  are  invested  giving  consideration  to  taxes,  liquidity ,  risk,  div ersification  and  other  prudent  inv estment objectives.\n\nNonrecurring Fair Value M easurements - NEE tests its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair v alue of the inv estment is less than the carrying value. Indicators of impairment may include, among other things, an observable market price below NEE's carrying value. Investments that are OTTI are written down to their estimated fair value on the reporting date and an impairment loss is recognized.\n\nNextEra Energy Resources owns a noncontrolling interest in XPLR, primarily through its limited partner interest in X PLR Infrastructure Operating Partners, LP (XPLR  OpCo),  and  accounts  for  this  ownership  interest  as  an  equity  method  investment.  During  the  preparation  of  NEE's  December  31,  2024  financial statements, it was determined that NextEra Energy Resources' investment in XPLR was OTTI as a result of a significant decline in trading price of XPLR's common units. The impairment reflected NEE's fair value analysis using the market approach and the observable trading price of XPLR's common units at December 31, 2024 of $17.80. When making the OTTI determination, NEE considered, among other things, the extent to which the publicly traded unit price was less than cost. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately $2.6 billion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately $1.8 billion, resulting in an impairment charge of $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax), which is recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024. In January 2025, XPLR announced a strategic repositioning, including suspension of the distribution to common unitholders for an indefinite period. This has resulted in the trading price of X PLR's common units to trade below the December 31, 2024 trading price. Should NEE determine, based on future analysis which includes the current and future trading prices of XPLR's common units, that an additional impairment is other-than-temporary , an impairment loss would be recorded, which would impact NEE's consolidated statement of income.\n\nDuring the preparation of NEE's September 30, 2023 financial statements, it was determined that NextEra Energy Resources' investment in X PLR was OTTI as a result of a significant decline in trading price of X PLR's common units during the final three trading days of the third quarter of 2023 following the announcement of a decrease in XPLR's distribution growth rate expectations. The impairment reflected NEE's fair value analysis using the market approach and the observable trading price of X PLR's common units at September 30, 2023 of $29.70. When making the OTTI determination, NEE considered, among other things, the extent to which the publicly traded unit price was less than cost. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately $4.2 billion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately $3.0 billion, resulting in an impairment charge of $1.2 billion ($0.9 billion after tax), which is recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, NextEra Energy Resources recorded an impairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax) related to an investment in M ountain V alley Pipeline, LLC (M ountain V alley Pipeline), which is reflected in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impairment reflected NextEra Energy Resources' fair value analysis based on the market approach and considered legal and regulatory challenges to the completion of construction and the resulting economic outlook for the pipeline. This impairment charge resulted in the complete write off of NextEra Energy Resources' equity method investment carrying",
