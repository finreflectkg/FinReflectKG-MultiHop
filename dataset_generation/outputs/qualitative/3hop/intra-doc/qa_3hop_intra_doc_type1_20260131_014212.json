      "answer": "PEP acquired Be & Cheery in the APAC region, indicating a strategic move to strengthen its presence in this market. In APAC, the Convenient Food category accounts for 80% of the regional revenue mix, highlighting PEP's emphasis on this product segment. This aligns with PEP's broader strategy of leveraging acquisitions to bolster its Convenient Food offerings, particularly in high-growth regions like APAC where this category dominates the revenue split.",

        "Hop 1: [PEP](page_115) \u2192 [APAC]: PEP acquired Be & Cheery in the APAC region, signaling strategic intent to expand in this geography.",

Meanwhile, in the acquisition and divestiture-related charges section, APAC shows $0 in charges for 2023, contrasting with prior years and other regions like PBNA and Europe that report significant activity.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

      "question": "How does Philip Morris's characterization of illicit trade as a systemic risk factor reconcile with the reported 10% market growth in Vietnam, where the company operates and where illicit trade was noted as a mitigating factor in that growth?",
      "answer": "Philip Morris identifies illicit trade as a significant risk factor that could negatively impact its business, volume, and results of operations. However, in Vietnam, a market where the company operates, the 2022 10-K notes a 10% increase in the total market, partially attributed to a lower prevalence of illicit trade due to pandemic-related supply disruptions for illicit products. This suggests that while illicit trade is generally seen as a threat, its temporary reduction in Vietnam had a positive effect on the overall market dynamics, potentially benefiting Philip Morris's position. This contrast highlights how the company's risk exposure is context-dependent and can shift based on regional market conditions.",

This increase was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Basic and diluted EPS of $5.83 increased by 13.0%. Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

          "chunk_text": "FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\n\nOn  September  29,  2021,  the  International  Trade  Commission  (\"ITC\")  issued  its  Final  Determination  (\"FD\"),  Limited  Exclusion  Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\"). The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the ID and found a subsequent violation. The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021. We have appealed the patent issues. Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office. The decision has no bearing outside the United States.\n\nUntil  recently,  there  were  no  countries  with  specific  product  standards  for  heat-not-burn  products.  Currently,  national  standards  setting minimum  quality  and  safety  requirements  for  such  products  have  been  adopted  in  several  countries  with  technical  heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam, the  U.K.  and  Ukraine.  In  Japan,  a  voluntary  standard  sets  minimum  safety  requirements  for  tobacco  heating  devices.  We  expect  other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated  tobacco  units,  and  e-cigarettes.  Most  of  the  EU  member  states  require  a  notification  submitted  six  months  before  the  intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\n\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for HEETS , used with the IQOS device, requesting regulatory recognition of the  reduction  of  toxic  substances  and  potential  risk  reduction  resulting  from  switching  to  this  product  compared  to  continued  cigarette smoking. In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited ('PML'), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia ('TGA') seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\n\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\n\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two  heat-not-burn  products,  one  of  which  was  our  Platform  1  product.  The  assessment  concluded  that,  while  still  harmful  to  health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ('BfR') published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%. This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment ('RIVM') published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product. RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.",

          "chunk_text": "FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\n\nOn  September  29,  2021,  the  International  Trade  Commission  (\"ITC\")  issued  its  Final  Determination  (\"FD\"),  Limited  Exclusion  Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\"). The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the ID and found a subsequent violation. The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021. We have appealed the patent issues. Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office. The decision has no bearing outside the United States.\n\nUntil  recently,  there  were  no  countries  with  specific  product  standards  for  heat-not-burn  products.  Currently,  national  standards  setting minimum  quality  and  safety  requirements  for  such  products  have  been  adopted  in  several  countries  with  technical  heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam, the  U.K.  and  Ukraine.  In  Japan,  a  voluntary  standard  sets  minimum  safety  requirements  for  tobacco  heating  devices.  We  expect  other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated  tobacco  units,  and  e-cigarettes.  Most  of  the  EU  member  states  require  a  notification  submitted  six  months  before  the  intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\n\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for HEETS , used with the IQOS device, requesting regulatory recognition of the  reduction  of  toxic  substances  and  potential  risk  reduction  resulting  from  switching  to  this  product  compared  to  continued  cigarette smoking. In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited ('PML'), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia ('TGA') seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\n\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\n\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two  heat-not-burn  products,  one  of  which  was  our  Platform  1  product.  The  assessment  concluded  that,  while  still  harmful  to  health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ('BfR') published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%. This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment ('RIVM') published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product. RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.",

This increase was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Basic and diluted EPS of $5.83 increased by 13.0%. Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

      "question": "How does Target's profit-sharing arrangement with TD on the Target Credit Card receivables align with the observed decline in RedCard penetration from 2022 to 2023, and what might this imply about the financial performance of the credit card program?",
      "answer": "Target receives a percentage of the profits generated by the Target Credit Card and Target MasterCard receivables through a program agreement with TD, which underwrites, funds, and owns the receivables. Meanwhile, RedCard penetration, which includes the Target Credit Card, declined from 19.8% in 2022 to 18.6% in 2023. This drop suggests a reduction in the proportion of sales made using RedCards, which could negatively impact the volume of credit card receivables and, consequently, the profit-sharing revenue from TD. Therefore, despite TD managing the credit risk and receivables, the decline in RedCard usage may signal a potential headwind for Target\u2019s ancillary income from the credit card program.",

      "answer": "Altria discloses that restricted cash is used as collateral for appeal bonds posted by PM USA, which totaled approximately $50 million as of December 31, 2021. These appeal bonds are part of PM USA\u2019s strategy to secure stays of adverse tobacco-related litigation judgments while appeals are pending. This restricted cash is directly tied to PM USA\u2019s litigation liabilities, which are significant\u2014amounting to over $896 million in payments and $227 million in interest as of 2021. Meanwhile, PM USA also serves as a guarantor for Altria\u2019s debt obligations, and its financial health is crucial to maintaining the validity of these guarantees under fraudulent conveyance laws. Therefore, the $50 million in appeal bonds not only reflects PM USA\u2019s ongoing legal exposure but also highlights the interplay between its liquidity constraints and its role in underpinning Altria\u2019s broader debt structure.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "answer": "PM reported a strong 44.8% cigarette market share in Turkey in 2021 (up from 41.3% in 2020), indicating competitive strength despite noting that illicit trade had increased in the country. In the Middle East & Africa commentary, Turkey's market growth was partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade, suggesting that illicit trade is a growing risk factor even as PM maintains and expands its dominant position. This dynamic is further contextualized in the risk factors section, where illicit trade is listed as a core challenge facing the company, directly impacting volume, revenue, and market stability. Thus, while PM is gaining share in Turkey, the rising illicit trade threatens to undermine this progress by eroding legal sales and consumer trust.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's dependency on Coca-Cola FEMSA, which accounted for $14.5 billion in 2021 net sales, highlights the critical role of this equity investee in distributing Coca-Cola products across several countries, including Costa Rica. Coca-Cola FEMSA operates in Costa Rica, a market where Coca-Cola benefits from tax incentive grants that reduced its income tax expense by $381 million in 2021. This implies that the Latin American markets, particularly those with tax incentives like Costa Rica, are strategically important for Coca-Cola\u2019s financial performance, as they not only contribute significantly to sales through key bottlers like Coca-Cola FEMSA but also provide cost advantages through favorable tax regimes.",

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

Meanwhile, PMI is contractually obligated under the Distribution Agreement to indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products it manufactured or had contract manufactured. However, Altria has not recorded any liability for this indemnification, deeming its fair value insignificant. This creates a complex financial exposure chain: if PM USA's guarantees are voided due to insolvency, Altria may face direct liability for the debt, while its ability to recover from PMI for related liabilities is uncertain and currently unquantified on the balance sheet.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "question": "How does USSTC's role in accepting sales returns for mint- and wintergreen-flavored smokeless tobacco products relate to the regulatory risks Altria faces from state-level flavor bans, particularly in light of the deferred revenue and cash discount changes implemented in 2021?",
      "answer": "USSTC's policy to accept returns for mint- and wintergreen-flavored products due to their limited shelf life creates a financial exposure through sales return liabilities. This operational policy intersects with regulatory risk as multiple states, including California and Massachusetts, have enacted or proposed flavor bans that could reduce demand for these products and increase returns. The change in cash discount methodology in 2021 for USSTC indicates a shift in revenue recognition practices, which could amplify the financial impact of increased returns if flavor restrictions lead to higher-than-estimated product returns, thereby affecting Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Note 3. Revenues from Contracts with Customers\n\nAltria disaggregates net revenues based on product type. For further discussion, see Note 15. Segment Reporting .\n\nIn 2020, a majority of Altria's businesses offered cash discounts to customers for prompt payment and calculated cash discounts as a percentage of the list price based on historical experience and agreed-upon payment terms. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 for USSTC and in the third quarter of 2021 for PM USA, cash discounts were calculated as a flat rate per unit, based on agreed-upon payment terms. Altria's businesses record receivables net of the cash discounts on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAltria's businesses that receive payments in advance of product shipment record such payments as deferred revenue. These payments are included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until control of such products is obtained by the customer. Deferred revenue was $287 million and $301 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. When cash is received in advance of product shipment, Altria's businesses satisfy their performance obligations within three days of receiving payment. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no differences between amounts recorded as deferred revenue and amounts subsequently recognized as revenue.\n\nReceivables were $47 million and $137 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; the decrease was due primarily to the Ste. Michelle Transaction. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no expected differences between amounts recorded and subsequently received, and Altria's businesses did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables.\n\nAltria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. While all of Altria's tobacco operating companies sell tobacco products with dates relative to freshness as printed on product packaging, it is USSTC's policy to accept authorized sales returns from its customers for products that have passed such dates due to the limited shelf life of USSTC's MST and snus products. Altria's businesses record estimated sales returns, which are based principally on historical volume and return rates, as a reduction to revenues. Actual sales returns will differ from estimated sales returns to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Altria's businesses reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements. All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory. Consequently, Altria's businesses do not record an asset for their right to recover goods from customers upon return.\n\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by Altria's businesses. Altria's businesses include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers. The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\n- Price promotion paymentsAltria's businesses make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to their retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n- Wholesale and retail participation paymentsAltria's businesses make payments to their wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with each business's trade agreements.\n\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates. Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

Notably, Altria has not recorded any liability for this indemnification, as its fair value is considered insignificant. This creates a contrast: while PM USA provides broad and unconditional financial guarantees for Altria\u2019s debt, its indemnification obligations to PMI are limited in scope and contingent on manufacturing attribution, potentially exposing Altria to asymmetric risk in its subsidiary relationships.",

The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "answer": "Altria\u2019s recent $1.0 billion debt issuance in November 2023, which is guaranteed by PM USA, reflects the company's strategic use of its subsidiary\u2019s financial strength to support corporate obligations. PM USA, as a 100% owned subsidiary, unconditionally guarantees Altria\u2019s debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement, and commercial paper program. This guarantee ensures that Altria, a holding company, can access capital at favorable terms, despite not generating direct operating cash flows. Altria relies on cash flows from its subsidiaries\u2014primarily through dividends, distributions, and intercompany interest payments\u2014to service this debt. The unconditional nature of PM USA\u2019s guarantee underscores the tight financial integration between the parent and its key operating subsidiary, reinforcing Altria\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations using downstream cash from PM USA.",

In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

These commodity futures are categorized as Level 1 financial assets, with their fair value determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges (page 112). The explicit linkage between the use of these futures for risk mitigation and their transparent valuation methodology indicates that MDLZ maintains a high degree of reporting clarity and market-based risk visibility for these instruments. This alignment supports a more transparent financial reporting framework for commodity-related exposures compared to Level 2 instruments, which rely on modeled or derived pricing.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Any unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market impacts)",

      "answer": "In 2024, PepsiCo's Beverages segment contributed 23% of its revenue in the APAC region, as shown in the regional revenue breakdown. However, the company's capital investment in APAC for the same year was only $10 million, significantly lower than investments in other regions like Europe ($123 million) and PBNA ($238 million). This contrast suggests that PepsiCo may be pursuing a more conservative or mature market strategy in APAC for its Beverages segment, maintaining current operations without significant expansion, given the relatively high revenue contribution compared to the low capital allocation.",

      "answer": "PM USA's unconditional guarantee of Altria's debt creates absolute liability exposure regardless of Altria's financial condition or changes in debt terms (Page 51). This guarantee obligation could require significant liquidity if Altria defaults on its debt. Simultaneously, PM USA has posted $50 million in appeal bonds collateralized with restricted cash to secure stays of tobacco litigation judgments pending appeal (Page 49). These restricted cash requirements reduce available liquidity that could otherwise support debt guarantee obligations. The combination of these commitments creates compounded liquidity pressure, as PM USA must maintain both debt guarantee capacity while tying up cash in litigation-related collateral, particularly concerning given the potential for additional adverse litigation outcomes that could require further bond postings or payments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

(1)\n\nThe accrued liability for tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, including related interest costs, was included in accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. Pre-tax charges for tobacco and health and certain other litigation were included in marketing, administration and research costs on Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses). Pre-tax charges for related interest costs were included in interest and other debt expense, net on Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\nAfter exhausting all appeals in those cases resulting in adverse verdicts associated with tobacco-related litigation, since October 2004, PM USA has paid judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) totaling approximately $896 million and interest totaling approximately $227 million as of December 31, 2021. These amounts include payments for Engle progeny judgments (and related costs and fees) totaling approximately $410 million and related interest totaling approximately $56 million.\n\nSecurity for Judgments: To obtain stays of judgments pending appeal, PM USA has posted various forms of security.

Michelle Transaction, which was used to partially fund the expansion of the January 2021 share repurchase program as discussed in Note 10. Capital Stock to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 10').\n\nIn October 2020, Altria filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which Altria may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nAltria has no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 18, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2021. From time to time, subsidiaries of Altria also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 9, PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, Altria makes interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 9.\n\nPurchase Obligations - Altria has entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2021, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $827 million and $1,274 million thereafter (a decrease from $1,095 million and $2,902 million at December 31, 2020, respectively, driven primarily by the Ste. Michelle Transaction).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria had $609 million of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. Substantially all of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on Altria's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 18, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states and territories of the United States that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 18.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that Altria's subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $4.4 billion on average for the next three years. These amounts exclude the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. Altria's subsidiaries paid approximately $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2021, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $50 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAlthough litigation is subject to uncertainty and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of PM USA, UST or Altria in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 18, Item 3 and Item 1A, management expects cash flow from operations, together with Altria's access to capital markets, to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs.\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities - Altria had $1.5 billion of accrued postretirement health care costs on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and estimates approximately $100 million of annual payments. In addition, Altria has accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets. For further information on Altria's postretirement health care and pension",

      "answer": "PMI's cigarette shipment volume in Turkey increased by 8.2% in 2022, primarily driven by the easing of pandemic-related measures and increased in-bound tourism, particularly by Turkish expatriates. This growth was partially offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade. Similarly, in Mexico, increased in-bound tourism contributed to a 4.2% rise in the total market and a 4.7% increase in PMI's shipment volume, mainly due to higher adult smoker average daily consumption.

Excluding  the  unfavorable  impact  of  the  Saudi  Arabia  customs  assessments, unfavorable  currency  and  acquisitions,  net  revenues  increased  by  18.3%,  reflecting:  favorable  volume/mix,  primarily  driven  by  higher cigarette volume (predominantly in PMI Duty Free and Turkey, partly offset by the GCC and North Africa), higher heated tobacco unit volume (mainly in Egypt, Jordan and PMI Duty Free) and favorable cigarette mix (mainly in the GCC, PMI Duty Free and Turkey); and a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by combustible pricing (primarily in Egypt and Turkey); partially offset by lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets, shown in \"Cost/Other\".\n\nOperating  income,  excluding  currency  and  acquisitions,  increased  by  23.8%,  mainly  reflecting:  a  favorable  pricing  variance;  favorable volume/mix, driven by the same factors and geographies as for net revenues noted above; and lower manufacturing costs (primarily related to combustible products); partly offset by the unfavorable impact of the Saudi Arabia customs assessments, as noted above for net revenues; higher marketing, administration and research costs; and lower fees for certain distribution rights, as noted above for net revenues.\n\nMiddle East &amp; Africa - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\n\nThe estimated total market in the Middle East &amp; Africa increased by 2.9% to 560.5 billion units, mainly driven by:\n\n- Algeria, up by 6.2%, primarily reflecting the impact on adult smoker average daily consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures, partly offset by the impact of price increases;\n- Egypt, up by 8.8%, mainly reflecting a favorable comparison due to pandemic-related supply chain shortages for competitors' products in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of adult smoker in-switching to cigarettes (mainly in the low-tax tier) from other combustible tobacco products;\n- South Africa, up by 13.2%, primarily reflecting a favorable comparison versus the second and third quarters of 2020, in which the total market was impacted by the pandemic-related ban on all tobacco sales from March 27th through August 17th, partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade stemming from the ban; and\n- Turkey,  up  by  8.2%,  mainly  reflecting  the  impact  on  adult  smoker  average  daily  consumption  of  the  easing  of  pandemic-related measures,  coupled  with  increased  in-bound  tourism  (particularly  by  Turkish  expatriates),  partially  offset  by  a  higher  estimated prevalence of illicit trade;\n\n## partly offset by\n\n- International Duty Free, down by 10.6%, primarily reflecting the impact of government travel restrictions and reduced passenger traffic since the start of the pandemic in March 2020; and\n- Tunisia, down by 15.6%, mainly reflecting higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade (primarily due to market disruptions impacting product availability and the impact of price increases in July 2021).\n\nOur Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 23.1%.",

      "answer": "The fair value of MDLZ's net investment hedge contracts, as disclosed in their financial instruments table, is $71 million as of December 31, 2021. These contracts are categorized under Level 2 financial assets, which are valued using an income approach based on observable market inputs. Specifically, for net investment hedge contracts, the valuation methodology aligns with that of other Level 2 instruments such as OTC currency exchange forwards and interest rate swaps, which rely on observable market rates and discounted cash flow analyses. This consistent application of valuation techniques across Level 2 financial assets underscores MDLZ's adherence to standardized methodologies that reflect market observability and risk management practices.",

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off.

      "question": "How does Altria's acquisition of NJOY for $2.9 billion align with its strategic positioning of e-vapor products as part of its 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision, given NJOY's role as the only e-vapor manufacturer with FDA-authorized pod-based products?",
      "answer": "Altria's acquisition of NJOY for $2.9 billion reflects a significant financial commitment to integrating e-vapor products into its broader portfolio, aligning with its stated 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision to transition adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives. NJOY, as the only e-vapor manufacturer with FDA-authorized pod-based products, provides Altria with a competitive edge in the regulatory landscape, enhancing its ability to credibly market reduced-risk products. This strategic move is further reinforced by NJOY's exclusive focus on e-vapor products, which are contract-manufactured and sold in the U.S., positioning Altria to capitalize on the growing consumer and regulatory preference for scientifically vetted alternatives to traditional combustible tobacco products.",

        "Hop 1: [MO](page_60) \u2192 [NJOY]: Altria completed the acquisition of NJOY Holdings, Inc. for approximately $2.9 billion, making NJOY a wholly-owned subsidiary.",
        "Hop 2: [NJOY] \u2192 [E-Vapor Products]: NJOY is engaged in the manufacture and sale of e-vapor products and is the only e-vapor manufacturer to receive FDA market authorizations for a pod-based e-vapor product.",
        "Hop 3: [E-Vapor Products] \u2190 [MO](page_4): E-vapor products are highlighted as part of Altria's 'Moving Beyond Smoking' strategy, which aims to transition adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives."

      "answer": "MO allocated $22 billion in goodwill to its cigarette business, reflecting its continued strategic emphasis on this segment despite a 9.9% drop in shipment volume in 2023. This decline suggests weakening demand or market pressures. However, PM USA, the subsidiary responsible for cigarette manufacturing and sales, remains a financially strong entity, evidenced by its unconditional guarantee of Altria's debt obligations, including $1.0 billion in newly issued senior notes. This dual perspective indicates that while cigarette volumes are falling, PM USA's financial strength underpins Altria's broader capital structure and debt commitments.",

These contracts are included within Level 2 financial liabilities, which are valued using observable market inputs. Specifically, the valuation methodology for Level 2 instruments, including net investment hedge contracts, relies on income-based approaches using observable market data such as forward rates, commodity prices, and interest rate curves, as detailed in the description of Level 2 financial assets and liabilities. This classification and valuation approach reflects the use of significant other observable inputs rather than direct market quotes (Level 1) or unobservable assumptions (Level 3).",

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

      "answer": "In 2019, the Gum & Candy category contributed $861 million to MDLZ's AMEA segment revenues, representing a significant portion of the $5,770 million total net revenues for that region. By 2021, the AMEA segment reported an operating income of $1,054 million, indicating a notable increase in profitability compared to its 2019 operating income of $691 million. While the filing does not explicitly state strategic importance, the sustained revenue contribution from Gum & Candy in AMEA suggests it plays a consistent role in the region's financial performance, even as overall profitability improved across the segment.",

      "question": "How does the $883 million cash outflow related to the Swedish Match acquisition connect to the strategic emphasis on ZYN as a leading brand in PM's smoke-free portfolio, given the integration of Swedish Match's regional operations into PM's geographic segments?",
      "answer": "The $883 million cash outflow referenced in the consolidated statements of cash flows on page 92 represents the amount paid by PMI to acquire full legal title to Swedish Match shares, which owns the ZYN nicotine pouch brand. This acquisition is directly tied to PMI's strategic positioning of ZYN as a leading brand in its smoke-free product portfolio, as noted on page 5. Furthermore, the integration of Swedish Match's business into PM's existing geographic segments\u2014detailed in the description of business on page 5\u2014highlights how PMI has operationally embedded Swedish Match's regional presence and ZYN's U.S. market leadership into its global smoke-free strategy. Together, these elements illustrate how a significant financial outlay was used to secure a key asset that now underpins PMI's geographic and product-line expansion in the smoke-free category.",

          "chunk_text": "In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act, PMI subsequently exercised its right to initiate arbitral proceedings to compulsorily redeem the remaining shares for which acceptances were not received and obtained legal title to 100% of the shares in Swedish Match on February 17, 2023. Cash paid in connection with such legal title, together with an immaterial amount attributable to open market purchases that were executed in December 2022 but settled in January 2023, amounted to $883 million and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. While PMI paid the referenced amounts and acquired legal title to the shares, under the Swedish Companies Act the redemption process was not complete until the final redemption price was determined by an arbitral tribunal. On September 12, 2023, the arbitral tribunal determined the final redemption price to be Swedish krona (SEK) 115.07, unchanged from the SEK 115.07 that PMI paid per share in connection with obtaining legal title to the shares. This process was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 when the opportunity to appeal the arbitral tribunal determination ended.\n\nSwedish  Match  is  a  market  leader  in  oral  nicotine  delivery  with  a  significant  presence  in  the  United  States  market.  The  acquisition  is  accelerating  PMI's transformation to become a smoke-free company with a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine.\n\nIn November 2023, PMI finalized all measurement period adjustments related to the Swedish Match acquisition.

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business.\n\n## General Development of Business\n\n## General\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a V irginia holding company incorporated in 1987. In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as postmarket studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies' IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match's General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI's IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. V ersions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI's transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product. By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\n\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled  prescription  products  for  therapy  areas  that  include  pain  management  and  cardiovascular  emergencies.  This  includes  medical  and  pharmaceutical cannabinoids,  and  non-recreational  cannabinoid  products  (including  CBD),  in  line  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  though  any  revenue  related  to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTUs\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our BLENDS , DELIA , HEETS , HEETS Creations (defined collectively as \" HEETS \"), SENTIA , TEREA, TEREA CRAFTED and TEREA Dimensions, as well\n\n## PART I",

IQOS was  first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014.\n\nIQOS and ZYN are the leading brands in our SFPs portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets. With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&amp;M , and Philip Morris. These five international cigarette brands contributed 80% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2024.

Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n\n## Description of Business\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment.

      "question": "How does the $122 million pre-tax gain from the remeasurement of PepsiCo's equity stake in Sabra relate to the acquisition of Sabra Dipping Company as a wholly-owned subsidiary, and what strategic implications does this have for Frito-Lay North America's product portfolio?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo recognized a $122 million pre-tax gain from remeasuring its previously held 50% equity stake in Sabra to fair value (page_73). This gain was directly tied to the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership in Sabra Dipping Company from Strauss Group, making Sabra a wholly-owned subsidiary (page_5). Sabra Dipping Company produces refrigerated dips and spreads, which are now fully integrated into Frito-Lay North America\u2019s branded convenient food offerings. This acquisition enhances FLNA\u2019s dip portfolio, complementing existing brands like Cheetos and Tostitos, and signals a strategic move to consolidate control over a key product category within its snack business.",

However, PM had already exited the Pakistani market in 2019 by closing its cigarette manufacturing plant, recording a $20 million charge as part of its global manufacturing infrastructure optimization. While the South & Southeast Asia segment saw a 14.0% decrease in operating income (excluding currency and acquisitions), this decline was driven by factors such as unfavorable pricing and volume/mix in other markets like the Philippines, India, and Indonesia. The illicit trade reduction in Pakistan likely did not benefit PM directly due to its absence from the market, suggesting that the company's regional performance was more influenced by dynamics in other countries where it remains active.",

This increase was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Basic and diluted EPS of $5.83 increased by 13.0%. Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

Meanwhile, beverages consistently accounted for 23% of net revenue in APAC across both 2022 and 2023 (page 72), showing a stable revenue base from this product category. Together, these figures suggest that PEP is maintaining its existing beverage-focused business model in APAC rather than pursuing transformative changes through acquisitions or divestitures. This strategic choice implies confidence in the region's current operational structure and beverage market positioning.",

      "answer": "The acquisition of Swedish Match AB in 2022 for $14.5 billion brought the ZYN brand, a leading oral nicotine product, into PM's portfolio, significantly expanding its smoke-free product offerings. This acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7.9 billion in intangible assets, with $7.8 billion attributed to trademarks and customer relationships. The valuation of these intangible assets required significant judgment by management, involving assumptions about revenue growth rates, royalty rates, profit margins, customer attrition rates, and discount rates. The inclusion of ZYN under the Swedish Match acquisition directly influenced the magnitude and composition of these intangible assets, reflecting the brand's market position and customer base in the U.S. oral nicotine segment.",

      "question": "How does Altria's indemnification arrangement with PMI for tobacco-related liabilities align with PM USA's unconditional guarantee of Altria's $3.0 billion Credit Agreement obligations, particularly given the potential for PM USA's insolvency if required to fulfill these guarantees?",
      "answer": "Altria has a Distribution Agreement with PMI under which PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured by PM USA for PMI. This indemnification is not recorded on Altria\u2019s balance sheet as its fair value is considered insignificant. Meanwhile, PM USA fully and unconditionally guarantees Altria\u2019s obligations under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement, among other debt instruments. However, if PM USA were to become insolvent\u2014defined in part as having debts exceeding the fair value of its assets\u2014due to these guarantee obligations, the enforceability of these guarantees could be challenged under bankruptcy or fraudulent transfer laws. This creates a potential conflict: while PMI indemnifies Altria for certain liabilities, the financial burden of Altria\u2019s broader debt obligations falls on PM USA, which could jeopardize its financial stability and, by extension, Altria\u2019s access to its subsidiary\u2019s cash flows.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "question": "What percentage of PM's 2023 long-term debt was directly tied to the Swedish Match acquisition, and how does this financial commitment reflect the strategic positioning of ZYN in PM's smoke-free transformation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, $6,121 million of PM's $45,941 million in total long-term debt was directly tied to the Swedish Match acquisition, representing approximately 13.3% of total long-term debt. This financial commitment reflects the strategic importance of ZYN in PM's smoke-free transformation, as Swedish Match's ZYN brand is a leading nicotine pouch product in the U.S., which complements PM\u2019s existing smoke-free product portfolio. The acquisition accelerates PM's goal of transitioning adult smokers to reduced-risk alternatives, aligning with their broader vision of ending cigarette sales and expanding their leadership in smoke-free products.",

        "Hop 1: PM(page_105) \u2192 Swedish Match AB: PM had $6,121 million in Euro credit facility borrowings related to the Swedish Match acquisition, part of their total long-term debt of $45,941 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Swedish Match AB \u2192 ZYN: Swedish Match is a market leader in oral nicotine delivery, with the ZYN brand being a key nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S., acquired to enhance PM\u2019s smoke-free portfolio.",

      "answer": "PM highlights ZYN as a key component of its smoke-free product (SFP) portfolio, noting that nicotine pouches, including ZYN, expanded to 37 markets by the end of 2024. ZYN is produced by Swedish Match, which PM acquired in November 2022. The acquisition was finalized in 2023 with PM paying SEK 115.07 per share and completing the redemption process to gain full ownership. This financial commitment, including $883 million paid to acquire legal title to Swedish Match shares, underscores the strategic value of ZYN in accelerating PM's transformation toward a smoke-free future. The integration of Swedish Match into PM's regional segments in 2024 further aligns with the company's broader goal of transitioning away from traditional cigarettes and expanding its leadership in alternative nicotine delivery systems.",

IQOS was  first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014.\n\nIQOS and ZYN are the leading brands in our SFPs portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets. With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&amp;M , and Philip Morris. These five international cigarette brands contributed 80% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2024. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji  Sam  Soe and Sampoerna  A in  Indonesia,  and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries.

Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n\n## Description of Business\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023. Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 3.7% in 2024.\n\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China.

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business.\n\n## General Development of Business\n\n## General\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a V irginia holding company incorporated in 1987. In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as postmarket studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies' IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match's General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI's IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. V ersions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI's transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product. By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\n\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled  prescription  products  for  therapy  areas  that  include  pain  management  and  cardiovascular  emergencies.  This  includes  medical  and  pharmaceutical cannabinoids,  and  non-recreational  cannabinoid  products  (including  CBD),  in  line  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  though  any  revenue  related  to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTUs\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our BLENDS , DELIA , HEETS , HEETS Creations (defined collectively as \" HEETS \"), SENTIA , TEREA, TEREA CRAFTED and TEREA Dimensions, as well\n\n## PART I",

Cash paid in connection with such legal title, together with an immaterial amount attributable to open market purchases that were executed in December 2022 but settled in January 2023, amounted to $883 million and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. While PMI paid the referenced amounts and acquired legal title to the shares, under the Swedish Companies Act the redemption process was not complete until the final redemption price was determined by an arbitral tribunal. On September 12, 2023, the arbitral tribunal determined the final redemption price to be Swedish krona (SEK) 115.07, unchanged from the SEK 115.07 that PMI paid per share in connection with obtaining legal title to the shares. This process was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 when the opportunity to appeal the arbitral tribunal determination ended.\n\nSwedish  Match  is  a  market  leader  in  oral  nicotine  delivery  with  a  significant  presence  in  the  United  States  market.  The  acquisition  is  accelerating  PMI's transformation to become a smoke-free company with a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine.\n\nIn November 2023, PMI finalized all measurement period adjustments related to the Swedish Match acquisition.

      "answer": "Delays in receiving regulatory authorizations for Horizon's heated tobacco products could significantly impact the financial returns of Altria's $2.9 billion NJOY investment. Horizon, in which Altria holds a 75% economic interest, is central to Altria's strategy to transition adult smokers to potentially reduced-risk products, including heated tobacco. Regulatory delays would hinder Horizon\u2019s ability to commercialize these products, delaying revenue generation and potentially affecting the integration and synergies expected from the NJOY acquisition. Since NJOY is positioned to expand Altria\u2019s presence in the e-vapor market, any setbacks in the broader smoke-free product ecosystem\u2014such as with Horizon\u2019s HTS products\u2014could reduce the expected market growth and competitive positioning that justified the NJOY investment.

      "question": "How does Altria's indemnification arrangement with PMI for tobacco-related liabilities interact with PM USA's unconditional guarantee of Altria's $3.0 billion Credit Agreement obligations, particularly in light of the potential insolvency implications for PM USA under federal bankruptcy law?",
      "answer": "Altria has a distribution agreement with PMI under which PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured by PM USA. This indemnification has no recorded liability on Altria's balance sheet as its fair value is deemed insignificant. Meanwhile, PM USA has issued unconditional guarantees for Altria's obligations under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement, among other debt instruments. These guarantees expose PM USA to absolute and unconditional liability, which could become problematic if PM USA is found to be insolvent under federal bankruptcy law, as the guarantees could be voided or subordinated. The interplay between PMI's indemnification and PM USA's guarantee creates a complex liability structure where PM USA's financial exposure could indirectly affect Altria's liquidity and creditworthiness, despite PMI's separate indemnification commitment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MO](page_108) \u2192 [PMI]: Altria references a distribution agreement with PMI under which PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured by PM USA, with no recorded liability due to insignificant fair value.",
        "Hop 2: [PMI] \u2192 [PM USA]: PMI's indemnification applies only to liabilities from products it manufactures or has contract manufactured by PM USA, creating a liability-sharing structure where PM USA remains exposed for products it manufactures independently.",
        "Hop 3: [PM USA] \u2190 [MO](page_51): PM USA guarantees Altria's $3.0 billion Credit Agreement obligations unconditionally, with no insolvency protections, meaning PM USA could face liability even if it becomes insolvent, potentially impacting Altria\u2019s liquidity."

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

This aligns with broader regulatory risks outlined in the document, which state that failure to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization for marketing or sale of innovative products could result in a 'material adverse effect' on Altria\u2019s business and its ability to achieve its Vision. The document also notes that the commercialization of Horizon's products is subject to 'commercialization milestones' and regulatory compliance, further emphasizing that without timely FDA authorizations, the financial and strategic value of the Horizon joint venture could be significantly undermined.",

      "question": "What implications does the $122 million year-over-year decline in PEP's Real Estate Commingled Funds have for the company's long-term pension plan investment strategy, given their stated objective of maintaining a diversified portfolio to meet benefit obligations?",
      "answer": "The $122 million decline in Real Estate Commingled Funds from $533 million in 2022 to $411 million in 2023 could signal either a strategic rebalancing or an unexpected underperformance in this asset class. PEP's investment strategy emphasizes diversification across equities, high-quality debt, and real estate to achieve a long-term return of 7.4% on U.S. plan assets (page 98). The drop in real estate holdings may affect this diversification objective, especially if it leads to a lower allocation to real estate than targeted. The company also notes that these funds are invested through limited partnerships and valued using unobservable inputs, which could imply higher volatility or liquidity constraints (page 99). Given that PEP actively manages its pension assets and reviews strategy periodically, this decline may prompt a reassessment of real estate exposure to ensure alignment with the long-term return target and risk tolerance.",

      "answer": "JTIUH\u2019s $50 million non-cash contribution to Horizon, the joint venture responsible for U.S. marketing and commercialization of heated tobacco stick (HTS) products, supports Altria\u2019s broader 'Moving Beyond Smoking' initiative, which aims to transition adult smokers away from traditional cigarettes toward potentially less harmful alternatives. Horizon, in which Altria holds a 75% economic interest, plays a direct role in this strategy by commercializing HTS products in the U.S. market. This investment from JTIUH enhances Horizon\u2019s resources and reinforces the collaboration between Altria and Japan Tobacco to expand their smoke-free product offerings, aligning with Altria\u2019s vision of leading the transition to a smoke-free future.",

      "answer": "Altria's impairment analysis for equity investments like Cronos considers regulatory authorization timing and market access risks as key valuation inputs, with a hypothetical 1% discount rate increase potentially triggering $125 million in impairments. Cronos specifically faces FDA regulations including pre-market authorization requirements and enforcement actions under the FSPTCA. The FDA's five-year strategic plan emphasizes accelerated PMTA decisions and robust enforcement against unauthorized products like flavored e-vapor devices, which directly impacts Cronos's market access and compliance costs. This alignment shows Altria must factor FDA's intensified regulatory approach into its Cronos investment risk assessment, particularly regarding Cronos's ability to maintain authorized product status and navigate evolving compliance requirements.",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

If the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeds its fair value and we determine that the loss in value is other than temporary, we record appropriate impairment losses. In a prior period, we concluded that the fair value of our investment in ABI declined below the carrying value of our investment in ABI and that this decline in fair value was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge for that period. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future and, if we do so, our net earnings and carrying value of our investment in ABI could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event that our ownership percentage in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, (i) we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, (ii) the number of nominees that we have the right to select for election to the ABI board of directors could be reduced and (iii) we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\n\n## Our investment in Cronos subjects us to certain risks associated with Cronos's business, including legal, regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nOur investment in Cronos, a Canadian cannabinoid company, subjects us to various risks relating to Cronos's business, such as legal, regulatory and reputational risks. Cronos is engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and marketing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products for the medical and adult-use markets in various international jurisdictions. Accordingly, Cronos's operations are subject to laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by various governmental authorities. In the United States, these laws include the Controlled Substances Act, the Civil Assets Forfeiture Reform Act (as it relates to violation of the Controlled Substances Act), all related applicable anti-money laundering laws and FDA regulations. A failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with applicable laws, including cannabis laws, could result in criminal, civil or tax  liability, negative impacts on the availability and cost of capital and credit or reputational harm for Altria.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology, much of which is managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud data service providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax  requirements; engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Recognizing the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape, we are committed to safeguarding our information assets, protecting consumer data and maintaining the integrity and availability of our systems. Accordingly, we have implemented an extensive cybersecurity risk management framework designed to identify, assess, mitigate and prevent potential cybersecurity risks and to align with industry best practices and all applicable regulatory requirements. We leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') Cybersecurity Framework and industry best practices to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks based on their potential impacts. We also use the NIST framework and industry best practices to drive enhancements to our program that are designed to protect our assets and third-party partners. The NIST framework also helps us maintain ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements. We align our security standards for infrastructure configuration with the Center for Internet Security's Benchmarks, which are prescriptive recommendations based upon the consensus of global cybersecurity experts.\n\nOur framework is built around the following key principles: (i) risk assessment and threat intelligence; (ii) security controls; (iii) incident response; (iv) employee awareness and training; and (v) third-party risk management. We have integrated our cybersecurity framework into our broad enterprise risk management processes, which allows us to leverage our existing enterprise-wide experience in managing risk and adapting to change in the cybersecurity threat landscape.\n\n- Risk Assessment and Threat Intelligence: We conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. Our Information Technology ('IT') Risk Management function, overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), leads internal self-assessments, which involve evaluating the security posture of critical systems, networks and applications as well as the potential impact of cybersecurity threats on our business operations, financial condition and reputation. IT Risk Management also conducts ongoing threat monitoring and has implemented monitoring systems, including technologies such as intrusion detection systems, security information and event management tools and threat intelligence programs.\n\nWe regularly engage third-party consulting services to conduct audits and assessments of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and processes and identify areas for improvement based on developments in industry best practices. We typically engage these services",

We actively engage with the FDA to develop and implement the FSPTCA's regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.\n\nThe FDA's implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states, territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements (see State Settlement Agreements below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our operating companies' ability to market and sell tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.\n\n- FDA's Five-Year Strategic Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation: In December 2023, the FDA released its five-year strategic plan to address concerns raised by the Reagan-Udall Foundation's operational evaluation of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. The Reagan-Udall report urged the FDA to clearly define product pathways, accelerate PMTA decision making, address the need for health risk communications to tobacco consumers and take enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law.\n\nThe FDA's five-year strategic plan lists five goals:\n\n- develop, advance and communicate comprehensive and impactful tobacco regulations and guidance;\n- ensure timely, clear and consistent product application review;\n- strengthen compliance of regulated industry using all available tools, including robust enforcement actions;\n- enhance knowledge and understanding of the risks associated with tobacco product use; and\n- advance operational excellence.\n\nAlthough the FDA, in conjunction with other federal entities, has increased enforcement activity, insufficient actions against manufacturers, distributors and retailers of certain product categories that violate the law, including certain disposable and flavored e-vapor products, certain oral nicotine pouch products and products targeted to minors, have allowed such products to proliferate on the market. In addition, the FDA's failure to clearly define product pathways and accelerate PMTA decision making has resulted in a market with few authorized smoke-free products available to adult tobacco consumers.\n\n- Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization E nforcement: The FSPTCA permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of February 15, 2007 and not subsequently modified ('Pre-existing Tobacco Products') and new or modified products authorized through the PMTA, Substantial Equivalence ('SE') or SE Exemption pathways. Subsequent FDA rules also provide a Supplemental PMTA pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products.\n\nThe FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability on the market, specifically:\n\n- Pre-existing Tobacco Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement;\n- cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered 'Provisional Products' for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011. These reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent, or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health;\n- tobacco products that were first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not Pre-existing Tobacco Products, are generally products for which either an SE report or PMTA needed to be filed by September 9, 2020; and\n- tobacco products containing nicotine from any source other than tobacco ( e.g. , synthetic nicotine) that were on the market between March 15, 2022 and April 14, 2022 and are not Pre-ex isting Tobacco Products are generally products for which a manufacturer must have filed a PMTA by May 14, 2022. A manufacturer was permitted to keep such a product on the market until July 13, 2022 provided that a PMTA was filed by May 14, 2022. Thereafter, unless the FDA granted the product a marketing order, the product is subject to possible FDA enforcement.\n\nModifications to currently marketed products, including modifications that result from, for example, changes to the quantity of tobacco product(s) in a package, a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier or contract manufacturer being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients or manufacturing processes, could trigger the FDA's pre-market review processes. Additionally, a manufacturer may be unable to maintain consistency in manufacturing processes as it increases the scale of its manufacturing operations in response to market expansion or product introduction. These circumstances could cause a manufacturer to receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination or (ii) a denial or withdrawal of a PMTA, either of which could result in a product being removed from the market. In addition, new scientific data continues to be developed relating to innovative tobacco products, which could impact the FDA's determination as to whether a product is, or continues to be, appropriate for the protection of public health and could, therefore, result in the removal of one or more products from the market.

      "answer": "PM reported a 17.3% increase in cigarette shipments in Turkey, with its market share rising from 41.3% to 44.8%. This growth occurred despite acknowledging that Turkey's total market expanded by 8.2%, partly due to easing pandemic restrictions and increased in-bound tourism. However, the company also noted that this growth was partially offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade. This suggests that while PM successfully outperformed the overall market growth, the presence of illicit trade remains a concern that could potentially limit its market share expansion or profitability in the region.",

This increase was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Basic and diluted EPS of $5.83 increased by 13.0%. Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

      "answer": "MDLZ uses commodity futures, which are categorized under Level 1 financial liabilities and measured at fair value based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges, to hedge against price risk for forecasted purchases of raw materials such as wheat, sugar, soybean oils, and cocoa. This approach aligns with their broader risk management strategy to protect against commodity price volatility, as these futures are exchange-traded instruments that provide transparency and liquidity. The fair value methodology ensures that the instruments are consistently valued using observable market data, which supports both financial reporting accuracy and effective risk mitigation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

      "question": "How does Altria's consolidated revenue recognition policy account for USSTC's unique return policy on freshness-dated products, particularly in light of the marketing restrictions imposed under the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement?",
      "answer": "Altria's consolidated revenue recognition policy accounts for USSTC's unique return policy by estimating and recording an allowance for returned goods based on historical volume and return rates, even though USSTC is the only subsidiary that accepts returns for products past freshness dates due to the limited shelf life of its MST and snus products. This is done as a reduction to revenues. At the same time, the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (STMSA), under which USSTC operates, imposes marketing and advertising restrictions that limit the company's ability to promote its products through traditional channels. These restrictions likely constrain USSTC's ability to manage inventory turnover through aggressive marketing, increasing reliance on return policies to maintain retailer relationships. Despite these specific conditions, Altria notes that differences between actual and estimated returns have not had a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, indicating that the company's estimation framework effectively incorporates the unique risk profile of USSTC within the broader Altria portfolio.",

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

Segment Reporting .\n\nIn 2020, a majority of Altria's businesses offered cash discounts to customers for prompt payment and calculated cash discounts as a percentage of the list price based on historical experience and agreed-upon payment terms. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 for USSTC and in the third quarter of 2021 for PM USA, cash discounts were calculated as a flat rate per unit, based on agreed-upon payment terms. Altria's businesses record receivables net of the cash discounts on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAltria's businesses that receive payments in advance of product shipment record such payments as deferred revenue. These payments are included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until control of such products is obtained by the customer. Deferred revenue was $287 million and $301 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. When cash is received in advance of product shipment, Altria's businesses satisfy their performance obligations within three days of receiving payment. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no differences between amounts recorded as deferred revenue and amounts subsequently recognized as revenue.\n\nReceivables were $47 million and $137 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; the decrease was due primarily to the Ste. Michelle Transaction. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no expected differences between amounts recorded and subsequently received, and Altria's businesses did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables.\n\nAltria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. While all of Altria's tobacco operating companies sell tobacco products with dates relative to freshness as printed on product packaging, it is USSTC's policy to accept authorized sales returns from its customers for products that have passed such dates due to the limited shelf life of USSTC's MST and snus products. Altria's businesses record estimated sales returns, which are based principally on historical volume and return rates, as a reduction to revenues. Actual sales returns will differ from estimated sales returns to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Altria's businesses reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements. All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory. Consequently, Altria's businesses do not record an asset for their right to recover goods from customers upon return.\n\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by Altria's businesses. Altria's businesses include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers. The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\n- Price promotion paymentsAltria's businesses make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to their retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n- Wholesale and retail participation paymentsAltria's businesses make payments to their wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with each business's trade agreements.\n\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates. Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

      "answer": "The fair value of the contingent consideration for Clif Bar increased from $440 million at the acquisition date to $548 million as of December 31, 2023. This change reflects the ongoing reliance on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) in MDLZ's financial reporting, as the liability is entirely categorized under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The increase suggests that the financial projections for net revenue, gross profit, and EBITDA, which are key assumptions in the valuation model, have evolved over time, likely due to updated expectations about Clif Bar's performance relative to the revenue and earnings targets set in the contingent payment agreement.",

      "answer": "MO's strategic investment in Horizon, a joint venture focused on HTS product commercialization, is closely tied to the receipt of regulatory authorizations, which is a key factor in generating new revenue streams. However, the company also discloses that delays or uncertainties in obtaining these authorizations could negatively impact Horizon's success and, by extension, MO's broader innovation strategy. On another section of the filing, MO reveals that a 1% increase in the discount rate used to value the e-vapor reporting unit could result in a $125 million impairment charge, underscoring the financial sensitivity of these investments to regulatory timelines and market conditions. This alignment highlights how strategic bets like Horizon are not only operationally dependent on regulatory outcomes but also financially exposed to shifts in valuation assumptions tied to those same authorizations, creating a dual risk of both operational delay and asset impairment.",

If the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative does not reject the ITC's decision, the restrictions will take effect on March 31, 2025 or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse.\n\nThe success of Horizon, our joint venture with JTIUH for the marketing and commercialization of HTS products in the United States, in generating new revenue streams by commercializing current and future HTS products owned by us or Japan Tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include (i) receipt of regulatory authorizations, (ii) prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting the parties or their plans for future collaboration and partnerships, (iii) changes in market or other conditions resulting in unanticipated delays in the design and development of future products or the commencement of test launches, (iv) the outcome of any legal proceedings or investigations that may be instituted against the parties or others related to the joint venture, (v) changes in the preferences of U.S. adult tobacco consumers, (vi) the failure to meet commercialization milestones and (vii) the ability of the parties to enter into future partnerships on terms acceptable to both parties and in the ex pected manner or timeframe, if at all. Such factors could have a negative effect on our ability to generate new revenue streams and enter new geographic markets.\n\nLengthy and unpredictable regulatory review periods complicate efforts to strategize and plan with respect to commercialization of new products, and we cannot predict or influence the speed with which the FDA reviews PMTAs. For example, a protracted FDA review of one of our operating companies' PMTAs would allow competitive products already on the market to establish market share, brand recognition and adult tobacco consumer loyalty in the absence of competition from our product. If we do not succeed in commercializing innovative tobacco products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers or we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization for the marketing or sale of these products, including with claims of reduced health risks, we could be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nOur inability to successfully counter the effects of illicit trade in tobacco products, including e-v apor products, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achiev e our Vision.\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and the diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another jurisdiction. Counterfeit versions of our operating companies' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands as well as other stakeholders' perceptions and opinions of our companies and brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing legislative or regulatory requirements, or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are legally distributed and sold, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nIn the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased, and such products now comprise the majority of the e-vapor category. The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers that has contributed to higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines. Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit disposable e-vapor products. This dynamic has made the operating environment challenging for our businesses. We have increased engagement with the FDA and other government agencies to encourage enforcement action against these illicit products, but such enforcement has been inadequate to date. We also have taken legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor business, which exposes us to additional costs and expenses. Our failure to counter the impacts of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the FDA's failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nFailure to complete or manage strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties, or realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties. Opportunities for strategic transactions may be limited, and the success of any such transaction is dependent upon our ability to complete and realize the expected benefits of the transaction in the expected time frame or at all. Following the completion of a transaction there may be certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent and operational risks, including diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating other businesses into existing operations and other challenges presented by a transaction",

Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "question": "How does the integration of Swedish Match's ZYN brand into PM's regional segments align with the company's strategic pivot toward smoke-free products, given the contrasting shipment volume trends between heated tobacco units and traditional cigarettes in 2023?",
      "answer": "PM's acquisition of Swedish Match brought the ZYN brand, a leading oral nicotine pouch, into its portfolio, complementing its existing smoke-free offerings like IQOS. In 2023, PM reported a 1.0% increase in total shipment volume, with heated tobacco units (HTUs) growing from 109.2 billion to 125.3 billion units, while Marlboro, its leading cigarette brand, saw a 1.9% decline in shipment volume. This shift reflects PM's strategic pivot toward smoke-free alternatives, a direction reinforced by the integration of Swedish Match\u2019s operations into PM's four regional segments starting in Q1 2024. The ZYN brand, alongside IQOS, is central to PM\u2019s long-term vision of a smoke-free future, as highlighted in the MD&A section. Rather than offsetting cigarette declines, ZYN and HTUs represent a deliberate reallocation of strategic focus toward reduced-risk products, aligning with PM's broader transformation and investment in consumer-centric, science-backed alternatives.",

This liability is tied to the acquisition's performance-based commitments. In 2023, MDLZ noted increased selling, general, and administrative expenses due to 'higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments,' which partially offset gains from higher net pricing and productivity improvements. Despite these costs, MDLZ achieved an increase in operating income margin from 11.2% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023, suggesting that the Clif Bar acquisition contributed to strategic growth while introducing measurable financial obligations and volatility.",

      "question": "How does MO's reliance on regulatory authorizations for future revenue growth from innovative tobacco products reconcile with the uncertainty surrounding Horizon's ability to meet commercialization milestones, given MO's majority ownership stake in the joint venture?",
      "answer": "MO's 2024 impairment analysis on page 29 highlights that the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit ($1.8 billion goodwill, $1.1 billion intangible assets) is highly sensitive to assumptions including the 'timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations' for products like oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor devices. This underscores the strategic importance of regulatory approvals in underpinning asset valuations and future cash flow expectations. However, on page 10, MO explicitly states that Horizon's success in generating new revenue streams depends on factors such as 'receipt of regulatory authorizations' and 'the failure to meet commercialization milestones,' indicating significant execution risk. Given that Horizon is MO's majority-owned joint venture for HTS products (as stated on page 22), the lack of alignment between the optimistic assumptions baked into asset valuations and the acknowledged operational risks around regulatory timelines and milestone achievement introduces a material tension. This suggests that impairment risks for the e-vapor unit could increase if Horizon underperforms due to delays in regulatory approvals or failure to meet commercialization targets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmaterial non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets (carrying value of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024), or both, in future periods. Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

If the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative does not reject the ITC's decision, the restrictions will take effect on March 31, 2025 or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse.\n\nThe success of Horizon, our joint venture with JTIUH for the marketing and commercialization of HTS products in the United States, in generating new revenue streams by commercializing current and future HTS products owned by us or Japan Tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include (i) receipt of regulatory authorizations, (ii) prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting the parties or their plans for future collaboration and partnerships, (iii) changes in market or other conditions resulting in unanticipated delays in the design and development of future products or the commencement of test launches, (iv) the outcome of any legal proceedings or investigations that may be instituted against the parties or others related to the joint venture, (v) changes in the preferences of U.S. adult tobacco consumers, (vi) the failure to meet commercialization milestones and (vii) the ability of the parties to enter into future partnerships on terms acceptable to both parties and in the ex pected manner or timeframe, if at all. Such factors could have a negative effect on our ability to generate new revenue streams and enter new geographic markets.\n\nLengthy and unpredictable regulatory review periods complicate efforts to strategize and plan with respect to commercialization of new products, and we cannot predict or influence the speed with which the FDA reviews PMTAs. For example, a protracted FDA review of one of our operating companies' PMTAs would allow competitive products already on the market to establish market share, brand recognition and adult tobacco consumer loyalty in the absence of competition from our product. If we do not succeed in commercializing innovative tobacco products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers or we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization for the marketing or sale of these products, including with claims of reduced health risks, we could be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nOur inability to successfully counter the effects of illicit trade in tobacco products, including e-v apor products, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achiev e our Vision.\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and the diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another jurisdiction. Counterfeit versions of our operating companies' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands as well as other stakeholders' perceptions and opinions of our companies and brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing legislative or regulatory requirements, or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are legally distributed and sold, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nIn the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased, and such products now comprise the majority of the e-vapor category. The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers that has contributed to higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines. Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit disposable e-vapor products. This dynamic has made the operating environment challenging for our businesses. We have increased engagement with the FDA and other government agencies to encourage enforcement action against these illicit products, but such enforcement has been inadequate to date. We also have taken legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor business, which exposes us to additional costs and expenses. Our failure to counter the impacts of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the FDA's failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nFailure to complete or manage strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties, or realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties. Opportunities for strategic transactions may be limited, and the success of any such transaction is dependent upon our ability to complete and realize the expected benefits of the transaction in the expected time frame or at all. Following the completion of a transaction there may be certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent and operational risks, including diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating other businesses into existing operations and other challenges presented by a transaction",

      "question": "How does Altria's reliance on PM USA's unconditional guarantee of corporate debt reconcile with the $35 million in appeal bonds collateralized by restricted cash that PM USA has posted in connection with ongoing tobacco-related litigation?",
      "answer": "Altria relies on PM USA to fully and unconditionally guarantee its corporate debt obligations, which include senior unsecured notes and commercial paper programs. This guarantee ensures that Altria has access to capital backed by the operating strength of PM USA. However, PM USA is also required to post appeal bonds, such as the $35 million in restricted cash collateral as of December 31, 2023, to secure stays of adverse litigation judgments. This dual role creates a tension: while PM USA's financial strength supports Altria's debt profile, its exposure to litigation liabilities\u2014secured by restricted cash\u2014could constrain its liquidity and indirectly impact its ability to support Altria's financial obligations. The interplay highlights how litigation risk, specifically through mechanisms like appeal bonds, could affect the stability of the guarantee structure that underpins Altria's capital strategy.",

As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates.

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "answer": "MDLZ uses commodity futures to hedge against price risks for raw materials such as cocoa, wheat, and sugar (page 94). These instruments are classified as Level 1 financial liabilities because they are exchange-traded and valued using quoted market prices on commodity exchanges (page 112). This classification indicates that the valuation methodology for these hedging instruments is based on highly transparent and observable market data, reflecting a lower level of subjectivity compared to Level 2 or 3 instruments.

See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

      "answer": "Altria issued $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes in November 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PM USA, a 100% owned subsidiary. These guarantees ensure Altria's ability to meet its debt obligations, even though the parent company operates as a holding company with limited direct cash flows. However, Altria also faces significant liquidity demands from purchase obligations, including $0.9 billion for inventory and production costs and $2.5 billion thereafter, along with $0.7 billion in other commitments related to marketing and capital expenditures. The unconditional guarantees from PM USA provide a layer of financial assurance for creditors, but they do not mitigate Altria's need to manage its near-term liquidity demands from operational commitments, which could strain cash flows available for debt servicing or other corporate purposes.",

For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

      "answer": "Philip Morris recorded a $20 million pre-tax asset impairment in Pakistan in 2019 related to cigarette plant closures, suggesting operational contraction in the region. However, by 2021, the company attributed a 17.3% increase in total cigarette market volume in Pakistan to a lower prevalence of illicit trade. This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by understanding that while the company reduced its manufacturing footprint in 2019, broader market dynamics\u2014particularly the decline in illicit trade due to pandemic-related supply disruptions\u2014positively impacted overall market conditions for cigarettes in 2021. Despite this short-term benefit, the company continues to identify illicit trade as a systemic risk in its business environment, indicating that while temporary supply disruptions may have boosted legal sales, long-term illicit trade remains a threat to revenue stability.",

Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

      "question": "How does the $2,316 million impairment charge recorded by PMI on its investment in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. relate to the unresolved allocation issue under the CCAA Proposed Plan involving CAD 32.5 billion in aggregate settlement obligations?",
      "answer": "PMI recorded a $2,316 million non-cash impairment charge on its investment in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) due to uncertainty and potential liability stemming from the unresolved allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount under the CCAA Proposed Plan. This impairment reflects PMI\u2019s assessment that the fair value of its investment had declined below its carrying value, primarily driven by the risk that RBH could be allocated a significant portion of the global settlement. The CCAA process, which RBH entered in 2019, resulted in deconsolidation and a shift to equity method accounting, and the Proposed Plan filed in October 2024 introduced new impairment indicators due to the unresolved allocation issue among RBH, ITL, and JTIM. The impairment decision was based on a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporated estimates of future sales, margins, and the likely share of the CAD 32.5 billion settlement allocated to RBH.",

('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019.\n\nAs part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 3, 2025 or the date on which the CCAA court issues an order on the Sanction Motion (discussed below) of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .' Ernst &amp; Y oung Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be ex tended by the stay period.\n\nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada. On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation against RBH, its affiliates, and its affiliates' indemnitees. The court-appointed mediator and monitors also filed substantially similar proposed plans for ITL and JTIM.\n\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM (together, the 'Companies') would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approx imately $22.3 billion). This amount would be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies' cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits (subject to an aggregate withholding of CAD 750 million (approximately $514 million) of working capital) and annual payments based on a percentage of the Companies' aggregate net income after taxes (excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full. As stated in the Proposed Plan, the issue of allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM (\"Allocation Issue\") remains unresolved.

PMI holds an approximate 25% economic interest in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Tabacs Alg\u00e9ro-Emiratie ('STAEM'), an Algerian joint venture that is  51% owned by EITA and 49% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et D\u00e9veloppement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI's brands (SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment).\n\nIn  April  2023,  PMI  acquired  an  approx imate  economic  interest  of 25%  in  United  Tobacco  Company  (\"UTC\").  UTC  is  an  entity  incorporated  in  Egypt  which manufactures products under license for PMI's Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of 14.7% in Eastern Company ('Eastern\"), Egypt's largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes. In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The max imum amount of these guarantee obligations is $385 million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.\n\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV , EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded  at  cost  and  are  included  in  equity  investments  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Transactions  between  these  equity  method  investees  and  PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below.\n\n## Equity securities:\n\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH') obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.\n\nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $3,280 million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada.

A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global",

('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019.\n\nAs part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 3, 2025 or the date on which the CCAA court issues an order on the Sanction Motion (discussed below) of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .' Ernst &amp; Y oung Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be ex tended by the stay period.\n\nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada. On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation against RBH, its affiliates, and its affiliates' indemnitees. The court-appointed mediator and monitors also filed substantially similar proposed plans for ITL and JTIM.\n\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM (together, the 'Companies') would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approx imately $22.3 billion). This amount would be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies' cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits (subject to an aggregate withholding of CAD 750 million (approximately $514 million) of working capital) and annual payments based on a percentage of the Companies' aggregate net income after taxes (excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full. As stated in the Proposed Plan, the issue of allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM (\"Allocation Issue\") remains unresolved.

The prelim inary estim ates of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assum ed in this transaction as of the acquisition date prim arily include goodwill and other i n tan g i bl e assets of  $0.3 bi l l i on  an d property , pl an t an d equi pm ent of  $0.1 bi l l i on. The prel i m i nary esti m ates of  the f ai r val ue of  i denti f i abl e assets acquired and liabilities assum ed are subject to revision, which m ay result in adjustm ents to the prelim inary values discussed above as valuations are fi n al i z ed. We expect to f i nal i z e th ese am ounts as soon as possi bl e, but no l ater than the f ourth quarter of 2025.\n\n## Acquisition of Siete\n\nOn January 17, 2025, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interest in Siete, a Mexican-Am erican foods business, in a transaction valued at approximately $1.2 billion. The total consideration transferred was approxim ately $1.2 billion in cash. The purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt am ounts as of the acquisition date.\n\nWe will account for the transaction as a business com bination in the first quarter of 2025. W e will recognize and m easure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assum ed at their estim ated fair values on the date of acquisition. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assum ed in Siete as of the acquisition date, which prim arily include goodwill and other intangible assets, will be based on prelim inary estim ates that are subject to revisions and m ay result in adjustm ents to the prelim inary values as valuations are finalized. W e expect to finalize these am ounts as soon as possible, but no later than the first quarter of 2026.\n\n## Juice Transaction\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approxim ately $ 3.5 billion in cash, subject  to  purchase  price  adjustm ents,  and  a 39%  noncontrolling  interest  in  TBG,  operating  across  North Am erica  and  Europe.  The  North America portion of the transaction was com pleted on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was com pleted on February 1, 2022. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG's portfolio of brands for sm all-form at and foodservice custom ers with chilled DSD. W e have significant influence over our investm ent in TBG and account for our investm ent under the equity m ethod, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG's earnings on our incom e statem ent (recorded in selling, general and adm inistrative expenses).\n\nAs a result of this transaction, in the year ended Decem ber 31, 2022, we recorded a gain in our PBNA and Europe divisions (see detailed incom e statement activity below), including $520 m illion related to the rem easurem ent of our 39% ownership in TBG at fair value using a com bination of the transaction price, discounted cash flows and an option pricing m odel related to our liquidation preference in TBG . In the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement on final purchase price adjustm ents for net working",

      "question": "Given the biscuits category's role in driving net pricing gains in 2021 and its substantial revenue contribution in the AMEA region, how does MDLZ's regional performance in AMEA reflect the strategic importance of biscuits, particularly when considering the $1,844 million in 2019 biscuit revenues from that region?",
      "answer": "MDLZ's 2021 performance highlights biscuits as a key driver of net pricing gains, which helped offset unfavorable volume/mix and rising raw material costs. In the AMEA region specifically, biscuits accounted for 7.8% of 2021 net revenues, the second-highest contribution after chocolate. This aligns with historical performance, as AMEA generated $1,844 million in biscuit revenues in 2019, indicating sustained strategic importance. The combination of pricing power and consistent revenue contribution suggests that biscuits are a core lever for profitability and growth in AMEA, especially in the context of emerging market dynamics and inflationary pressures.",

The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million in 2021. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable volume mix reflected volume declines as the region lapped prior-year strong volume growth driven by significantly increased food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic as well as impacts from labor disruptions and supply chain constraints in the second half of 2021. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits, candy, chocolate and gum.\n\nSegment operating income decreased $216 million (13.6%), primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs, higher Simplify to Grow Program costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower COVID-19 related costs), a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs (lower incremental COVID-19 related costs and productivity) and favorable currency.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $1,049 million (14.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (6.3 pp), the impact of acquisitions (6.3 pp) and higher net pricing (2.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix, in part due to the positive volume impact from COVID-19 as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption, was driven by gains in biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, chocolate and candy. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, chocolate and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.\n\nSegment operating income increased $136 million (9.4%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing and the impact of acquisitions. These favorable items were partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher raw material costs, lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation changes and higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program.",

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA.

The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "question": "How does NJOY's FDA-authorized e-vapor product portfolio align with Altria's strategic focus on transitioning adult smokers to reduced-risk products, particularly in light of the $2.9 billion acquisition and NJOY's newly consolidated status?",
      "answer": "Altria's acquisition of NJOY for $2.9 billion underscores its strategic commitment to transitioning adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives, as stated in its Vision on page 4. NJOY, now a wholly owned subsidiary, is the only e-vapor manufacturer with FDA market authorization for a pod-based product, giving it a regulatory advantage in a key growth segment. This positions Altria to leverage NJOY\u2019s compliant product portfolio to meet evolving regulatory standards while aligning with its broader business transformation goal. The consolidation of NJOY into Altria\u2019s financial structure (as noted in the financial statements on page 60) further integrates this capability into its core operations, enhancing its ability to scale and invest in this segment.",

        "Hop 1: [MO](page_4) \u2192 [E-Vapor Products]: Altria introduces NJOY as part of its strategic portfolio shift toward reduced-risk products following its Vision to transition adult smokers away from cigarettes.",

        "Hop 3: [NJOY] \u2190 [MO](page_60): NJOY became a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria following the $2.9 billion acquisition on June 1, 2023, and is now fully consolidated into Altria\u2019s financial reporting structure."

      "question": "How does the unresolved WTO customs valuation dispute involving Thailand affect Philip Morris's competitive positioning against local and international tobacco companies in the Thai market, given the company's stated challenges with import cost predictability and pricing strategy?",
      "answer": "The unresolved WTO customs valuation dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, where the WTO panel ruled that Thailand had no basis to challenge PM Thailand's declared import values and taxes, creates regulatory uncertainty that directly impacts Philip Morris's cost structure and pricing flexibility in Thailand. Despite Thailand agreeing to comply with the ruling, the Philippines asserts non-compliance, and the stalled WTO Appellate Body process has left the matter unresolved since 2010. This uncertainty likely affects PM Thailand\u2019s ability to accurately forecast import costs, which are critical to pricing decisions. In a market where PMI competes against local and international tobacco firms like British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco Inc., and state-owned enterprises in Thailand, the inability to stabilize customs costs could limit PM's ability to maintain competitive pricing. Additionally, the company notes on page 19 that in markets like Thailand, adult consumers are sensitive to price changes and may shift to lower-priced brands during economic uncertainty, further constraining profitability. Therefore, the unresolved dispute directly intersects with PM's stated risk of being unable to improve margins through price increases, especially in a market where cost predictability is essential for maintaining competitive positioning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM(page_68) \u2192 WTO Panel Decision: The WTO ruled in favor of Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited, stating Thailand had no basis to challenge customs valuation, but the dispute remains unresolved due to ongoing bilateral discussions.",
        "Hop 2: WTO Panel Decision \u2192 Thailand: Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO ruling, and the Appellate Body remains non-operational, creating ongoing uncertainty for import tax treatment.",
        "Hop 3: Thailand \u2190 PM(page_19): Thailand is identified as a market with intense competition, where price sensitivity and regulatory pressures significantly influence PM's ability to maintain profitability and brand competitiveness."

We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

      "question": "How does Altria's joint venture structure with JTIUH through Horizon reflect both the strategic positioning of their heated tobacco products initiative and the financial contributions to the venture?",
      "answer": "Altria's joint venture Horizon, established in October 2022 with JTIUH, reflects a strategic commitment to transitioning toward smoke-free products, particularly heated tobacco sticks (HTS). Structured as a perpetual entity, Horizon is responsible for the U.S. commercialization of HTS products from either party, aligning with Altria's broader 'Vision' of moving adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives. The governance model\u2014where Altria holds a 75% economic interest and JTIUH holds 25%\u2014demonstrates Altria's dominant role in steering the initiative. Financial evidence from 2022 shows that JTIUH made a $50 million non-cash contribution to Horizon, indicating tangible investment backing the strategic partnership. This financial input complements the long-term vision by providing initial capital to support the development and marketing of HTS products, thereby reinforcing the joint venture\u2019s importance in Altria\u2019s smoke-free transition strategy.",

      "question": "How does the discussion of Horizon's dependence on favorable business conditions in the risk factors section reconcile with its strategic positioning as a central component of Altria's 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision, given that Horizon is classified in the 'all other' segment despite holding a 75% economic interest?",
      "answer": "The risk factors section on page 10 highlights that Horizon's success in commercializing heated tobacco products depends on factors like regulatory authorizations, economic and market conditions, consumer preferences, and partnership dynamics. These conditions are external and largely uncontrollable, posing significant risks to Horizon's ability to generate new revenue streams. Meanwhile, page 4 emphasizes Horizon's strategic importance as a core element of Altria's 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision, which aims to transition adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives. Despite this strategic emphasis, Horizon is grouped in the 'all other' segment, a categorization typically reserved for less financially material operations. This creates a tension: a venture described as central to Altria's long-term vision is not yet financially significant enough to warrant its own segment, suggesting Horizon is still in a developmental or uncertain phase. The risk factors further underscore that unfavorable macroeconomic or regulatory conditions could directly impede Horizon's progress, which would challenge Altria's broader strategic shift away from traditional tobacco products.",

        "Hop 1: MO(page_10) \u2192 Business Conditions: Horizon's success is tied to external factors like economic conditions, regulatory approvals, and consumer preferences.",

        "Hop 3: Horizon \u2190 MO(page_4): Horizon is positioned as a key part of Altria's 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision but is classified in the 'all other' segment, indicating limited current financial impact."

While Gum & Candy accounted for 2.8% of AMEA\u2019s total revenue in 2021, the 2022 figures show it remained a smaller contributor compared to core categories like Biscuits and Chocolate, which dominated the segment\u2019s revenue mix.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ(page_137) \u2192 AMEA: MDLZ reports $5,770 million in total net revenues for the AMEA segment in 2022, with Gum & Candy contributing $861 million.",
        "Hop 2: AMEA \u2192 Gum & Candy: In 2021, Gum & Candy represented 2.8% of AMEA\u2019s revenue by percentage, compared to higher shares from Biscuits (7.8%) and Chocolate (8.3%).",
        "Hop 3: Gum & Candy \u2190 MDLZ(page_136): In 2022, Gum & Candy generated $816 million in revenue within the AMEA segment, consistent with the $861 million reported on page 137, and still lagged behind other product categories."

      "question": "How does the unconditional guarantee of Altria's debt securities by PM USA relate to the expected termination of PM USA's State Settlement Agreement obligations in late 2024, particularly in light of Altria's $1.0 billion debt issuance in November 2023?",
      "answer": "PM USA's unconditional guarantee of Altria's debt, including the $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes issued in November 2023, remains in place even as PM USA's financial obligations under the State Settlement Agreements are expected to terminate in late 2024. This termination could reduce PM USA's future cash outflows by approximately $3.4 billion annually in payments related to the State Settlement Agreements and FDA fees, potentially enhancing its financial capacity to support Altria's debt obligations. However, the guarantees remain absolute and unconditional, meaning PM USA's ability to meet its guarantee obligations will depend on its overall financial health, which could be affected by the termination of these significant historical liabilities.",

        "Hop 1: MO(page_74) \u2192 PM USA: MO discloses that PM USA, a 100% owned subsidiary, unconditionally guarantees MO's debt securities, including those issued in November 2023 totaling $1.0 billion.",

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "question": "How might the potential adoption of FCTC-inspired flavor restrictions in U.S. states impact Altria's financial obligations under both state settlement agreements and FDA user fees, given its current exposure to inflation-adjusted payments and regulatory compliance costs?",
      "answer": "The potential adoption of FCTC-inspired flavor restrictions in U.S. states could have a dual financial impact on Altria. First, as seen in page 39, Altria faces inflation-adjusted payments under state settlement agreements, with the 2024 inflation calculation at approximately 3.4%, based on CPI-U data. These agreements already place operational and marketing restrictions on tobacco products. If flavor restrictions\u2014similar to those enacted in California, Massachusetts, and New York\u2014expand further, they could reduce sales volume and shift consumer behavior, potentially lowering Altria\u2019s market share, which directly affects the settlement payment formula. Second, page 38 shows that Altria is subject to FDA user fees under the FSPTCA, which are also adjusted for market share and industry volume. A decline in sales due to flavor restrictions could reduce Altria\u2019s relative market share, potentially lowering its FDA fee burden in the short term, but increasing compliance and regulatory scrutiny costs. However, Altria also notes that failure to comply with evolving FDA requirements could result in enforcement actions with material adverse effects. Thus, while flavor restrictions might reduce some financial obligations, they could increase regulatory and operational risks, especially if adult smokers shift away from smoke-free alternatives, contradicting Altria\u2019s Vision.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MO](page_39) \u2192 [Legislation]: Altria discusses U.S. state legislation that restricts the sale and marketing of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, noting that six states and D.C. have enacted such bans.",
        "Hop 2: [Legislation] \u2192 [FCTC]: The FCTC, as noted in page 38, recommends and in some cases requires signatory nations to adopt similar flavor and marketing restrictions, influencing U.S. state-level legislation indirectly, even though the U.S. is not a party to the treaty.",
        "Hop 3: [FCTC] \u2190 [MO](page_38): Altria is subject to FDA regulation under FSPTCA, which imposes user fees and compliance costs that are tied to market share and industry volume, and it acknowledges the potential influence of international regulatory trends like the FCTC on domestic policy."
