      "answer": "Disney strategically bundles Star+ with Disney+ in Latin America as part of its DTC offering (Combo+), aiming to increase subscriber acquisition and retention. However, the DTC risk section highlights that pricing pressures and consumer sensitivity to increasing DTC service costs could lead to higher churn rates and negatively impact profitability. This raises concerns about how the bundling strategy might conflict with the risk of consumer resistance to price increases, especially in a highly competitive streaming market where customers may be unwilling to pay for multiple services. Thus, while bundling may initially attract subscribers, it could also expose Disney to the risks of subscriber churn and pricing sensitivity in the region.",

As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively.

      "question": "How does the voting power structure of CMCSA's Class A and Class B common stock, where Class B shares carry 15 votes each and are fully owned by Brian L. Roberts, relate to the company's stock repurchase activity and equity changes reported in 2024?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class A common stockholders hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock, which carries 15 votes per share and is fully owned by Brian L. Roberts, accounts for the remaining 33 1/3%. Despite this concentrated voting structure, the company repurchased $7.25 billion worth of common stock in 2024, primarily from Class A shares, reducing retained earnings and impacting equity balances. Notably, Class B common stock had no change in balance during the year, indicating that repurchases did not affect the concentrated voting power held by Roberts.",

      "question": "Given Meta's acknowledgment that Reels monetizes at a lower rate than other Facebook products, how does the company's strategic emphasis on Reels align with its broader financial reliance on Facebook's advertising revenue, which constitutes the majority of the Family of Apps segment that generated $70.13 billion in 2023?",
      "answer": "Meta's strategic emphasis on Reels, despite its lower monetization rate, aligns with its broader financial goals for Facebook and the Family of Apps segment by prioritizing long-term user engagement and platform growth over short-term advertising revenue. The company explicitly states its willingness to promote products like Reels that may initially reduce monetization in favor of enhancing user experience and long-term platform value. This is consistent with the 2023 investment of $70.13 billion in the Family of Apps, which includes Facebook and its features like Reels, underscoring the importance of these platforms to Meta's core advertising business. While Reels may currently generate less ad revenue, its growth could enhance overall user engagement across the ecosystem, potentially leading to increased monetization opportunities in the future. This approach reflects Meta's broader philosophy of making strategic trade-offs to support long-term value creation, even if it means accepting near-term revenue pressures.",

      "answer": "Disney uses foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge $9.9 billion in firm commitments and forecasted transactions as of September 28, 2024, with gains and losses deferred in AOCI until the transactions occur. However, in the VAR model disclosed on page 60, the company explicitly excludes firm commitments, accounts receivable, and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the risk analysis. Despite this exclusion, the VAR model still estimates a maximum one-day loss of $255 million as of the same fiscal year-end, reflecting the company's broader exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities, and equity market fluctuations. This suggests that while Disney actively hedges its firm commitments, the VAR model focuses on the residual risk in financial instruments rather than the underlying commercial exposures.",

      "answer": "Disney evaluates certain assets for non-recurring fair value measurement when triggering events occur, such as a decrease in estimated future cash flows, which led to impairment charges in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024. These fair value measurements use Level 3 valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flow analysis. On another section of the filing, Disney states that when triggering events occur, they test long-lived assets for impairment by comparing estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the asset's carrying value, depending on whether the asset is held for use or sale. This indicates that the Level 3 fair value assessments are directly tied to the triggering events that initiate impairment testing, aligning the valuation methodology with the broader asset recovery evaluation framework.",

      "answer": "Disney reported floating-rate borrowings as of September 28, 2024, with interest rates in effect on that date, which may not reflect future costs. Although the company utilizes pay-fixed interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt, it did not have any such swaps designated as cash flow hedges at the end of fiscal 2024. This contrasts with their active use of foreign exchange cash flow hedges, where $9.9 billion in notional amounts were designated to manage currency risk. The absence of designated pay-fixed swaps suggests Disney is not actively hedging interest rate risk on floating-rate borrowings through cash flow hedges, potentially leaving them exposed to rate increases, even as they proactively manage foreign exchange volatility.",

      "answer": "The concentrated ownership of Class B Common Stock, with only 3 record holders (primarily Brian L. Roberts), gives them disproportionate voting power (33 1/3% of total voting power with 15 votes per share), allowing them to significantly influence major corporate decisions. Meanwhile, Class A shareholders, who hold the remaining 66 2/3% of voting power but with only 1 vote per share, received the majority of dividend payouts ($4.6 billion in 2021) and saw significant share repurchases (73.2 million shares in 2021). This creates a governance dynamic where Class B shareholders maintain strategic control, while Class A shareholders bear more of the financial returns through dividends and share repurchases, highlighting a separation between economic returns and corporate control.",

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks in the future, including the development of our additional theme  park  in  Orlando,  Florida,  which  resumed  in  2021.  Capital  expenditures  for  subsequent  years  will  depend  on  numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented  in  other  financing  activities,  repurchases  of  common  stock  under  our  share  repurchase  program  and  employee  plans, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Net cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted  primarily  of  repayments  of  debt  and  the  related  early  redemption  payments  presented  in  other  financing  activities, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented  in  other  financing  activities,  partially  offset  by  proceeds  from  borrowings  and  proceeds  from  the  settlement  of cross-currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities.\n\nIn August 2021, we completed a debt exchange transaction. We issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, which have maturities ranging from 2051 to 2063 and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.93%, and made cash payments of $0.5 billion in exchange for $11.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2033 to 2058 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.04%. The debt exchange resulted in an overall reduction in the weighted-average interest rate for our total outstanding debt of 0.27% and extended the overall weighted-average maturity by 2 years. The debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, and therefore following the exchange, the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments, and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes.\n\nIn 2021, we made debt repayments of $11.5 billion, including $4.9 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of $3.3 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025, as well as amounts due at maturity and the cash payments in the debt exchange transaction.\n\nIn 2021, we issued \u20ac1.75 billion ($2.1 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate Euro senior notes maturing in 2026 and 2029. In 2021, we had borrowings of $0.6 billion under the Universal Beijing Resort term loan.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. Effective May 25, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. During 2021, we repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion. In January 2022, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization from the $6 billion remaining as of December 31, 2021 to $10 billion. Under the authorization, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares, which may be in the open market or in private transactions.\n\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.6 billion in 2021. We paid dividends of $4.5 billion in 2021. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nThe  chart  below  summarizes  our  share  repurchases  under  our  publicly  announced  share  repurchase  program  authorization  and dividends paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, we paid $674 million and $534 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.",

      "answer": "Disney's VAR model excludes forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and foreign-denominated receivables/payables from its risk analysis, focusing instead on existing financial instruments like debt, derivatives, and equity investments. The VAR model estimates a maximum one-day loss of $255 million at September 28, 2024, based on a 95% confidence level and assumes normal market conditions. However, the company actively manages foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions through forward and option contracts, with $9.9 billion in notional hedging exposure as of September 28, 2024. These hedging instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and their gains or losses are deferred in AOCI until the forecasted transactions occur. This suggests that while the VAR model does not account for forecasted transactions, Disney mitigates the risk associated with these transactions through proactive hedging strategies, which are separately accounted for and disclosed in the financial statements.",

This distinction affects how earnings are distributed across share classes. Meanwhile, Class C shares are actively used in employee compensation plans, with over $21.7 billion in stock-based compensation expenses tied to equity awards in 2023, and 723 million shares reserved for future issuance under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan. The company's share repurchase program, which includes both Class A and Class C shares, is executed based on market conditions and economic cost considerations. This creates a dynamic where Class C shares are both issued for compensation and repurchased from the market, while Class B shares are primarily retained for voting control purposes without active issuance or repurchase.

      "question": "Given that The Walt Disney Company owns 80% of ESPN while Hearst Corporation holds the remaining 20%, how does the significant increase in ESPN+ programming costs ($1.564 billion in 2022, up 40% from 2021) reflect on Disney's strategic investment in ESPN's digital platforms, especially after the sale of ESPN's X Games and owned radio stations?",
      "answer": "Disney's 80% ownership of ESPN, with Hearst Corporation holding the remaining 20%, positions ESPN as a core asset within Disney\u2019s media networks portfolio. Despite divesting certain ESPN-owned physical assets like the X Games and radio stations in fiscal 2022, Disney significantly increased its investment in ESPN's digital infrastructure by allocating $1.564 billion to ESPN+ and other programming costs in 2022, a 40% increase from 2021. This suggests a strategic pivot toward digital streaming and away from traditional media formats, aligning with broader industry trends and Disney\u2019s focus on direct-to-consumer platforms.",

      "question": "How does the $21.7 billion of Alphabet's 2023 stock-based compensation expense tied to Class C stock issuance align with the treatment of Class B stock in diluted net income per share calculations, given the structural relationship between these share classes?",
      "answer": "The $21.7 billion of stock-based compensation expense for 2023, which is primarily associated with awards expected to settle in Class C stock, increases the number of Class C shares outstanding over time as RSUs vest. This affects the diluted net income per share calculation, which accounts for potentially dilutive securities like RSUs using the treasury stock method. In computing diluted net income per share for Class A stock, the conversion of Class B stock is assumed, but Class B shares themselves are not subject to dilution in their own calculation. Despite these differences in dilution treatment, both Class C and Class B shares receive equal per-share dividends and liquidation rights. Therefore, while Class C shares are directly impacted by SBC-related issuances, the structural alignment of dividend and liquidation rights ensures parity in net income allocation across share classes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [GOOGL](page_83) \u2192 [Class C Stock]: Discloses that $21.7 billion of 2023 stock-based compensation expense is tied to awards expected to settle in Class C stock, with 723 million shares reserved under the 2021 Stock Plan.",
        "Hop 2: [Class C Stock] \u2192 [Class B Stock]: Both share classes have identical liquidation and dividend rights, though they differ in voting rights and dilution treatment in EPS calculations.",
        "Hop 3: [Class B Stock] \u2190 [GOOGL](page_81): Notes that diluted EPS for Class A assumes conversion of Class B shares, but diluted EPS for Class B does not, and all classes receive equal per-share distributions."

      "answer": "The corporate governance structure of CMCSA is significantly influenced by the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock. According to the equity note (page 91), holders of Class B common stock collectively control 33 1/3% of the voting power, and each Class B share is entitled to 15 votes. This voting power is non-dilutable, meaning it cannot be reduced by the issuance of additional shares of any class of common stock. Class A shares, which are publicly traded on Nasdaq as disclosed on page 1, collectively hold 66 2/3% of the voting power, but the number of votes per share fluctuates depending on the total number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding. This dual-class structure ensures that the holders of Class B shares retain significant influence over corporate decisions despite owning a smaller portion of the total shares. The governance structure thus reflects a strategic balance where public shareholders (holding Class A shares) have a majority of shares but limited voting control, while a smaller group (holding Class B shares) maintains outsized influence over decision-making.",

      "answer": "The lack of Class B common stock issuances or balance changes in 2024, despite the convertible nature of Class B shares into Class A, suggests that the existing voting power structure remains stable. Class B shares, which carry 15 votes per share and collectively hold 33 1/3% of the voting power, did not change in quantity during the year, as evidenced by the $0 balance in both beginning and end-of-year Class B common stock figures on page 68. Meanwhile, significant repurchases of Class A shares occurred, reducing Class A common stock from $48 million to $47 million in 2024 (page 67), which could have diluted the relative voting influence of Class B shares had there been no conversion. However, since no conversions occurred, the non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power of Class B shares was preserved, reinforcing the concentrated control mechanism within Comcast\u2019s equity structure.",

        "Hop 2: [Class A Common Stock] \u2192 [Class B Common Stock]: Class B shares are convertible share-for-share into Class A, but carry significantly more voting power (15 votes per share) and maintain 33 1/3% of total voting power.",

      "answer": "The 8% dividend increase approved by CMCSA's Board in January 2022 reflects a financial commitment to Class A shareholders, who collectively hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power. However, the Class B shares, which are non-dilutable and represent 33 1/3% of the voting power, are owned entirely by Brian L. Roberts and grant him significant influence over key corporate decisions, including those that could impact dividend policy. Despite the Board\u2019s decision to raise dividends, any future changes to dividend policy or corporate structure would still require the consent of the Class B shareholders due to their separate approval rights over material transactions. This dynamic highlights a structural tension between financial incentives to Class A shareholders and the concentrated control held by the Class B shareholder.",

If  we  are  unable  to  reach  agreement  with  a  labor  union  before  the  expiration  of  a  collective  bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.\n\nIn  addition,  NBCUniversal's Media segment and Sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.\n\nOur Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced  below  9,444,375,  which  was  the  number  of  shares  of  Class  B  common  stock  outstanding  on  the  date  of  our  2002 acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp.'s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets)  or  issuances  of  securities  that  require  shareholder  approval,  transactions  that  result  in  any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles  of  incorporation  or  by-laws  that  would  limit  the  rights  of  holders  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Brian  L.  Roberts,  our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium. 1\n\n## Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 2: Properties\n\nWe believe that substantially all of our physical assets were in good operating condition as of December 31, 2021. Our corporate headquarters and Cable Communications segment headquarters are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at One Comcast Center. Additionally, the Comcast Technology Center, which is adjacent to the Comcast Center, is a center for Cable Communications' technology and engineering workforce, as well as the home of our NBCUniversal and Telemundo owned local broadcast stations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

      "question": "How does AT&T's ability to call the Tower Preferred Interests at issue price after five years reconcile with the redemption option held by investors that could trigger a deemed liquidation, especially in light of the company's broader policy on redeemable preferred equity instruments?",
      "answer": "AT&T has the ability to call the Tower Preferred Interests at the issue price beginning five years after issuance, which includes $1,500 for the Class A-1 series paying 5.0% and $4,500 for the Class A-2 series paying 4.75%. However, if AT&T fails to pay distributions for two or more periods or breaches certain credit requirements, holders of the Tower Preferred Interests have the option to require redemption, which would trigger a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes. This contrasts with the broader policy on redeemable preferred equity instruments outlined in the stockholders' equity section, where redemption is permissible after five years or upon contingent events, and the company retains the intent and ability to settle such redemptions in cash. The dual structure allows AT&T to manage its capital obligations proactively while exposing it to potential liquidity demands if credit conditions deteriorate or distributions are not timely paid.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [T](page_130) \u2192 [Tower Preferred Interests]: AT&T issued $6,000 in Tower Preferred Interests (comprising $1,500 Class A-1 and $4,500 Class A-2) with a call option exercisable after five years at the issue price.",
        "Hop 2: [Tower Preferred Interests] \u2192 [Redemption Option]: Holders of these interests can require redemption upon failure to pay distributions for two or more periods or upon failure to meet minimum credit ratings, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.",
        "Hop 3: [Redemption Option] \u2190 [T](page_129): AT&T's broader policy on redeemable preferred equity instruments, including those in subsidiaries like Mobility II, indicates a consistent structure where redemption options exist alongside the company's intent and ability to settle such redemptions in cash."

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nAuthorized Shares We have authorized 14 billion common shares of AT&amp;T stock and 10 million preferred shares of AT&amp;T stock, each with a par value of $1.00 per share. Cumulative perpetual preferred shares consist of the following:\n\n- Series A: 48 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference and a dividend rate of 5.000%.\n- Series B: 20 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a \u20ac100,000 per share liquidation preference, and an initial rate of 2.875%, subject to reset after May 1, 2025.\n- Series C: 70 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference, and a dividend rate of 4.75%.\n\nSo long as the quarterly preferred dividends are declared and paid on a timely basis on each series of preferred shares, there are no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T common shares. The preferred shares are optionally redeemable by AT&amp;T at the liquidation price on or after five years from the issuance date, or upon certain other contingent events.\n\nStock Repurchase Program From time to time, we repurchase shares of common stock for distribution through our employee benefit plans or in connection with certain acquisitions. Our Board of Directors has approved the following authorization to repurchase common stock: (1) March 2013 authorization program of 300 million shares, which was completed in 2020 and (2) March 2014 authorization program for 300 million shares, with approximately 178 million outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n\nTo implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 142 million shares totaling $5,278 under the March 2013 and March 2014 authorizations. During 2021, there were no shares repurchased under the March 2014 authorization.\n\nDividend Declarations In December 2021 and December 2020, AT&amp;T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $36 and a quarterly common dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock.\n\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries We have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration. The preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Mobility II\n\nWe previously issued 320 million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), representing all currently outstanding Mobility preferred equity interests, which pay cash distributions of $560 per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions are declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred equity interests will not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares.\n\nA holder of the Mobility preferred interests may put the interests to Mobility II. Mobility II may redeem the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022. When either option arises due to a passage of time, that option may be exercised only during certain periods.\n\nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) twenty-five dollars ($8,000 in the aggregate) plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price may be paid with cash, AT&amp;T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&amp;T common stock, at Mobility II's sole election. In no event shall Mobility II be required to deliver more than 250 million shares of AT&amp;T common stock to settle put and redemption options. We have the intent and ability to settle the Mobility preferred equity interests with cash.\n\n## Tower Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.",

      "answer": "Comcast's dividend policy, which includes an 8% increase in dividends to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis for Class A common stockholders, signals a favorable financial return for these investors. However, this benefit is contrasted by the structural governance imbalance where Class B common stockholders, who hold a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, retain outsized control over key corporate decisions. This includes separate approval rights over major transactions such as mergers, asset sales, and amendments to the company\u2019s articles of incorporation, even if such actions are in the broader shareholder interest. This dynamic highlights a tension between financial incentives for the majority of shareholders and the concentrated governance power held by the Class B stockholder, Brian L. Roberts, which could influence strategic direction independently of broader shareholder sentiment.",

Our corporate headquarters and Cable Communications segment headquarters are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at One Comcast Center. Additionally, the Comcast Technology Center, which is adjacent to the Comcast Center, is a center for Cable Communications' technology and engineering workforce, as well as the home of our NBCUniversal and Telemundo owned local broadcast stations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We also have leases for numerous business offices, warehouses and properties throughout the United States that house divisional information technology operations.\n\n## Cable Communications Segment\n\nOur  principal  physical  assets  consist  of  operating  plant  and  equipment,  including  cable  system  signal  receiving,  encoding  and decoding devices, headends and distribution networks. Our distribution network consists primarily of headends, content distribution servers,  coaxial  and  fiber-optic  cables,  lasers,  routers,  switches  and  related  electronic  equipment.  Our  cable  plant  and  related equipment generally are connected to utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities, although in some areas the  distribution  cable  is  buried  in  underground  ducts  or  trenches.  The  physical  components  of  cable  systems  require  periodic maintenance and replacement.\n\nOur cable system signal reception sites, which consist primarily of antenna towers and headends, and our microwave facilities are located on owned and leased parcels of land, and we own or lease space on the towers on which certain of our equipment is located. We own most of our service vehicles.\n\nOur broadband network consists of fiber-optic cables owned or leased by us and related equipment. We also operate national and regional data centers with equipment that is used to provide services, such as email and web services, to our broadband and",

      "question": "How does Netflix's pricing flexibility for membership plans in different countries relate to their risk of increased programming costs due to content provider licensing challenges, particularly in light of their stated strategy to secure exclusive rights for original content?",
      "answer": "Netflix's pricing flexibility, which allows them to vary membership plan prices from $1 to $32 per month depending on the country and plan features, is directly tied to their need to manage costs associated with content licensing. The company faces risks related to rising programming costs as content providers become more selective and exclusive in licensing agreements. This is exacerbated by their strategy to secure exclusive rights for original content, which can drive up acquisition and renewal costs. If content providers withdraw or restrict access to popular content, Netflix may need to adjust pricing to offset these increased costs or risk member dissatisfaction. The intellectual property section further highlights that as competition for content intensifies, licensing terms may become less favorable, directly impacting their ability to maintain a compelling content mix at a cost that supports their current pricing structure.",

As of December 31, 2024, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $32 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $8 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\n\nWe also earn revenue from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources.

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies.

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon.

Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

ESPN directly produces the SEC Network, which is part of its broader sports content portfolio and is distributed to 51 million subscribers according to the subscriber table. Given that Disney owns 80% of ESPN, the increased investment in ESPN+ programming likely supports content offerings like the SEC Network, which in turn benefits from ESPN's established distribution reach.

      "question": "What is the financial impact of Hulu's subscriber growth on ESPN's reported revenue from sports programming, given the fees Hulu pays to ESPN for content rights and ESPN+'s standalone subscriber base?",
      "answer": "Hulu's subscriber growth of 6%, as reported in the key metrics section, likely contributes to increased fees paid to ESPN for content rights, which in turn supports ESPN's reported revenue from sports programming. According to the 10-K, Hulu pays ESPN for the right to air its networks, and this financial relationship is explicitly recognized in the segment revenue eliminations. ESPN+ itself reported approximately 26 million paid subscribers as of September 2024, indicating a significant standalone direct-to-consumer sports offering. However, the fees from Hulu represent an additional revenue stream for ESPN that is not directly tied to ESPN+'s subscriber count but rather to the carriage of ESPN networks within Hulu\u2019s Live TV package. Therefore, Hulu\u2019s subscriber growth indirectly supports ESPN's overall revenue through contractual content fees, separate from ESPN+'s direct subscription model.",

      "answer": "AT&T can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years after issuance, giving the company the option to redeem these interests at a fixed point in time. Holders of the Telco preferred interests also have the right to require redemption upon contingent events such as failure to pay distributions for two or more periods or not meeting minimum credit rating requirements. This dual option structure\u2014where both the issuer and the holder have redemption rights\u2014provides AT&T with strategic flexibility to manage its capital structure, particularly in response to credit conditions or financial constraints. The redemption option language in both the Telco LLC and Mobility II sections shows a consistent approach in how AT&T structures contingent redemption features, reinforcing the company's intent to maintain control over preferred equity obligations while aligning with broader corporate finance strategies.",

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nAuthorized Shares We have authorized 14 billion common shares of AT&amp;T stock and 10 million preferred shares of AT&amp;T stock, each with a par value of $1.00 per share. Cumulative perpetual preferred shares consist of the following:\n\n- Series A: 48 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference and a dividend rate of 5.000%.\n- Series B: 20 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a \u20ac100,000 per share liquidation preference, and an initial rate of 2.875%, subject to reset after May 1, 2025.\n- Series C: 70 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference, and a dividend rate of 4.75%.\n\nSo long as the quarterly preferred dividends are declared and paid on a timely basis on each series of preferred shares, there are no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T common shares. The preferred shares are optionally redeemable by AT&amp;T at the liquidation price on or after five years from the issuance date, or upon certain other contingent events.\n\nStock Repurchase Program From time to time, we repurchase shares of common stock for distribution through our employee benefit plans or in connection with certain acquisitions. Our Board of Directors has approved the following authorization to repurchase common stock: (1) March 2013 authorization program of 300 million shares, which was completed in 2020 and (2) March 2014 authorization program for 300 million shares, with approximately 178 million outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n\nTo implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 142 million shares totaling $5,278 under the March 2013 and March 2014 authorizations. During 2021, there were no shares repurchased under the March 2014 authorization.\n\nDividend Declarations In December 2021 and December 2020, AT&amp;T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $36 and a quarterly common dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock.\n\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries We have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration. The preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Mobility II\n\nWe previously issued 320 million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), representing all currently outstanding Mobility preferred equity interests, which pay cash distributions of $560 per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions are declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred equity interests will not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares.\n\nA holder of the Mobility preferred interests may put the interests to Mobility II. Mobility II may redeem the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022. When either option arises due to a passage of time, that option may be exercised only during certain periods.\n\nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) twenty-five dollars ($8,000 in the aggregate) plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price may be paid with cash, AT&amp;T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&amp;T common stock, at Mobility II's sole election. In no event shall Mobility II be required to deliver more than 250 million shares of AT&amp;T common stock to settle put and redemption options. We have the intent and ability to settle the Mobility preferred equity interests with cash.\n\n## Tower Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.",

      "answer": "The 40% year-over-year increase in ESPN+ programming costs in 2022 reflects Disney\u2019s strategic emphasis on strengthening its sports media offerings under its majority ownership of ESPN. Despite Hearst Corporation holding a 20% stake in ESPN, Disney\u2019s 80% ownership allows it to drive key investment decisions, including significant spending on ESPN+ content. This increase in programming costs signals a deliberate push to enhance ESPN+'s digital footprint and competitive positioning in the sports streaming market, aligning with Disney\u2019s broader focus on direct-to-consumer platforms.

      "answer": "Disney identifies triggering events\u2014such as a decrease in estimated future cash flows\u2014as key indicators that may necessitate asset impairment tests. When such events occur, the company evaluates affected assets for potential impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the cash flow estimate, the asset is written down to its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow model (a Level 3 valuation technique). In fiscal 2024, this process led to impairment charges recorded in the second and fourth quarters, as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. These impairments required non-recurring fair value measurements, where the discounted cash flow method was used to estimate fair value. The use of triggering events thus directly drives the frequency and valuation methodology of non-recurring fair value measures, particularly in cases where cash flow expectations decline, leading to write-downs based on Level 3 inputs.",

However, the DTC section on page 29 highlights that brand damage could significantly impact Disney+'s success, especially since brand risks are not confined to one business segment. On page 22, Star Wars is identified as a major licensed property, contributing to significant royalty revenue. If brand damage were to occur around Star Wars\u2014due to, for example, negative consumer perceptions or controversies\u2014it could simultaneously reduce subscriber interest in Disney+ and lower licensing revenue.

As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

The Company licenses characters from its film, television and other properties for use on third-party products in these categories and earns royalties, which are usually based on a fixed percentage of the wholesale or retail selling price of the products. Some of the major properties licensed by the Company include: Mickey and Friends, Star Wars, Spider-Man, Disney Princess, Avengers, Frozen, Toy Story, Winnie the Pooh and Cars.\n\n## Retail\n\nThe Company sells Disney-, Marvel-, Pixar- and Lucasfilm-branded products through shopDisney branded internet sites and Disney Store branded retail locations. At October 1, 2022, the Company owns and operates approximately 40 stores in Japan, 20 stores in North America, three stores in Europe and one store in China.\n\nThe Company creates, distributes and publishes a variety of products in multiple countries and languages based on the Company's branded franchises. The products include children's books and comic books.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\n\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\n\n## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\n\nThe Company's businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its IP, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. Important IP includes rights in the content of motion pictures, television programs, electronic games, sound recordings, character likenesses, theme park attractions, books and magazines, and merchandise. Risks related to the protection and exploitation of IP rights and information concerning the expiration of certain of our copyrights are set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\n\n## AVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available without charge on our website, www.disney.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

      "answer": "AT&T continues to depreciate the wireless tower assets on its balance sheet because it did not transfer control of these assets in the transaction with Crown Castle, which prevented sale-leaseback accounting treatment. As of December 31, 2021, these tower assets had a net book value of $725 and were depreciated at a rate of $39 annually. Meanwhile, Crown Castle holds fixed-price purchase options for these towers at the end of their respective lease terms, totaling approximately $4,200 based on estimated fair market values at that time.

We record interest on the financing obligation using the effective interest method at a rate of approximately 3.9%. The financing obligation is increased by interest expense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the tower assets had a balance of $725 and $764, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nPayments made to Crown Castle under this arrangement were $253 for 2021. At December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement are $258 for 2022, $264 for 2023, $269 for 2024, $274 for 2025, $280 for 2026 and $707 thereafter.\n\n## NOTE 20. TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTV\n\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). The transaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Video business. Effective August 1, 2021, we began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method and recorded our share of DIRECTV earnings as equity in net income of affiliates, with DIRECTV considered a related party (see Note 10).\n\nFor the five months ended December 31, 2021, our share of DIRECTV's earnings included in equity in net income of affiliates was $619. Cash distributions from DIRECTV totaled $1,942, with $619 classified as operating activities and $1,323 classified as investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nIn addition to the assets and liabilities contributed to DIRECTV, we recorded total obligations of approximately $2,100 to cover certain net losses under the NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract, of which $1,800 is in the form of a note payable to DIRECTV (see Note 6). Cash payments to DIRECTV on the note totaled $459 and were classified as financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Amounts due under the DIRECTV note were $1,341 at December 31, 2021.\n\nThrough our WarnerMedia properties, we license content and programming and provide advertising services to DIRECTV. Revenue recognized from DIRECTV, which was previously eliminated, totaled approximately $670 for the five months ended December 31, 2021. We also provide DIRECTV with network transport for U-verse products and sales services under commercial arrangements for up to five years.\n\nPursuant to a commercial agreement, WarnerMedia continues to sell DIRECTV's advertising inventory under a revenue sharing agreement. WarnerMedia records amounts billed as advertising revenue and recognizes expense for DIRECTV's revenue share, which was approximately $600 for the five months ended December 31, 2021. Under separate transition services agreements, we provide DIRECTV certain operational support, including servicing of certain of their customer receivables for up to three years. For the five months ended December 31, 2021, we billed DIRECTV approximately $550 for these costs, which were primarily recorded as a reduction to the operations and support expenses incurred and resulted in net retained costs to AT&amp;T of approximately $200.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had accounts receivable from DIRECTV of $436 and accounts payable to DIRECTV of $329.\n\nWe are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support, other than noted above, as our involvement with DIRECTV is limited to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognized on our balance sheet.",

      "answer": "The absence of issued Class B Common Stock in 2024 removes the dual-class voting power dynamic, as Class B shares historically held 33\u2153% of the voting power and were convertible into Class A shares. In 2023, Class A Common Stock had 4,842,108,959 issued shares with $48 billion in equity value, while Class B Common Stock had 9,444,375 issued and outstanding shares, contributing to a differentiated equity structure. By 2024, only Class A Common Stock remains issued (4,651,093,045 shares), with equity value declining slightly to $47 billion, suggesting a shift in governance and equity control. This structural change affects shareholder influence and aligns voting power exclusively with Class A shareholders.",

        "Hop 1: [CMCSA](page_67) \u2192 [Class B Common Stock]: Discloses that Class B Common Stock had 9,444,375 issued and outstanding shares in 2023 but none in 2024, indicating a structural change in equity composition.",
        "Hop 2: [Class B Common Stock] \u2192 [Class A Common Stock]: Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares on a share-for-share basis, linking their issuance and voting rights.",

      "question": "Given that only three holders own Class B common stock, which controls 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, how does the company's repurchase of Class A common stock during 2021 impact the relative ownership and voting influence of the two stock classes?",
      "answer": "The company repurchased 73.2 million shares of Class A common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021, which reduces the number of outstanding Class A shares and increases the proportional ownership and voting influence of the concentrated Class B shares, which are held entirely by Brian L. Roberts.

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks in the future, including the development of our additional theme  park  in  Orlando,  Florida,  which  resumed  in  2021.  Capital  expenditures  for  subsequent  years  will  depend  on  numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented  in  other  financing  activities,  repurchases  of  common  stock  under  our  share  repurchase  program  and  employee  plans, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Net cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted  primarily  of  repayments  of  debt  and  the  related  early  redemption  payments  presented  in  other  financing  activities, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented  in  other  financing  activities,  partially  offset  by  proceeds  from  borrowings  and  proceeds  from  the  settlement  of cross-currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities.\n\nIn August 2021, we completed a debt exchange transaction. We issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, which have maturities ranging from 2051 to 2063 and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.93%, and made cash payments of $0.5 billion in exchange for $11.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2033 to 2058 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.04%. The debt exchange resulted in an overall reduction in the weighted-average interest rate for our total outstanding debt of 0.27% and extended the overall weighted-average maturity by 2 years. The debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, and therefore following the exchange, the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments, and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes.\n\nIn 2021, we made debt repayments of $11.5 billion, including $4.9 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of $3.3 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025, as well as amounts due at maturity and the cash payments in the debt exchange transaction.\n\nIn 2021, we issued \u20ac1.75 billion ($2.1 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate Euro senior notes maturing in 2026 and 2029. In 2021, we had borrowings of $0.6 billion under the Universal Beijing Resort term loan.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. Effective May 25, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. During 2021, we repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion. In January 2022, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization from the $6 billion remaining as of December 31, 2021 to $10 billion. Under the authorization, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares, which may be in the open market or in private transactions.\n\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.6 billion in 2021. We paid dividends of $4.5 billion in 2021. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nThe  chart  below  summarizes  our  share  repurchases  under  our  publicly  announced  share  repurchase  program  authorization  and dividends paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, we paid $674 million and $534 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.",

      "question": "How does Meta's strategic emphasis on Reels as a growth priority reconcile with its acknowledgment that Reels monetizes at a lower rate than other Facebook products, given the company's overall investment allocation between the Family of Apps and Reality Labs?",
      "answer": "Meta's strategic emphasis on Reels is part of its broader effort to enhance user engagement and evolve its platform offerings, as noted in the overview of Facebook's features on page 7, which highlights Reels as a key component of the user experience. However, the company acknowledges on page 23 that Reels monetizes at a lower rate than other Facebook products like Feed and Stories, which could negatively impact short-term financial performance. Despite this, Meta continues to invest heavily in the Family of Apps, allocating $70.13 billion in 2023 to this segment, compared to $18.02 billion for Reality Labs. This indicates that the company is prioritizing long-term engagement and platform evolution over immediate monetization efficiency, betting that increased user time spent on Reels will ultimately support broader monetization opportunities in the future.",

        "Hop 1: [META](page_7) \u2192 [Facebook]: Meta describes Facebook as a core product within the Family of Apps, emphasizing features like Reels as part of its strategy to build community and drive engagement.",

      "question": "How does AT&T's ability to redeem the Mobility II preferred equity interests with cash or stock compare with the more restrictive redemption terms tied to Tower Holdings' preferred interests, and what does this reveal about the company's capital structure flexibility across different subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "AT&T has the flexibility to redeem the Mobility II preferred equity interests either with cash, stock, or a combination thereof, and it has the intent and ability to settle these with cash. In contrast, the redemption of Tower Holdings' preferred interests is more narrowly tied to specific contingent events, such as failure to pay distributions or credit rating breaches, and the redemption price is based on market value or a fixed formula without explicit stock settlement flexibility. This distinction reveals that AT&T structures capital redemption terms differently across subsidiaries\u2014offering more discretion in Mobility II while Tower Holdings\u2019 terms are more prescriptive and contingent, suggesting a tiered capital structure strategy aligned with the risk profiles and asset values of each entity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [T](page_129) \u2192 [Redemption Option]: The filing states that the redemption option for Mobility II preferred equity interests can be settled in cash, AT&T common stock, or a combination, at Mobility II\u2019s sole election, with a cap of 250 million shares of AT&T stock.",
        "Hop 2: [Redemption Option] \u2192 [Tower Preferred Interests]: Tower Holdings\u2019 preferred interests can be called at the issue price after five years or upon asset sale proceeds, and redemption by holders is triggered only by contingent events like failure to pay distributions or credit rating drops.",
        "Hop 3: [Tower Preferred Interests] \u2190 [T](page_130): The Tower preferred interests specify that redemption upon holder option results in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes and limits the form of consideration to align across equal or subordinate classes, unlike the broader settlement flexibility in Mobility II."

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nAuthorized Shares We have authorized 14 billion common shares of AT&amp;T stock and 10 million preferred shares of AT&amp;T stock, each with a par value of $1.00 per share. Cumulative perpetual preferred shares consist of the following:\n\n- Series A: 48 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference and a dividend rate of 5.000%.\n- Series B: 20 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a \u20ac100,000 per share liquidation preference, and an initial rate of 2.875%, subject to reset after May 1, 2025.\n- Series C: 70 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference, and a dividend rate of 4.75%.\n\nSo long as the quarterly preferred dividends are declared and paid on a timely basis on each series of preferred shares, there are no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T common shares. The preferred shares are optionally redeemable by AT&amp;T at the liquidation price on or after five years from the issuance date, or upon certain other contingent events.\n\nStock Repurchase Program From time to time, we repurchase shares of common stock for distribution through our employee benefit plans or in connection with certain acquisitions. Our Board of Directors has approved the following authorization to repurchase common stock: (1) March 2013 authorization program of 300 million shares, which was completed in 2020 and (2) March 2014 authorization program for 300 million shares, with approximately 178 million outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n\nTo implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 142 million shares totaling $5,278 under the March 2013 and March 2014 authorizations. During 2021, there were no shares repurchased under the March 2014 authorization.\n\nDividend Declarations In December 2021 and December 2020, AT&amp;T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $36 and a quarterly common dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock.\n\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries We have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration. The preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Mobility II\n\nWe previously issued 320 million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), representing all currently outstanding Mobility preferred equity interests, which pay cash distributions of $560 per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions are declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred equity interests will not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares.\n\nA holder of the Mobility preferred interests may put the interests to Mobility II. Mobility II may redeem the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022. When either option arises due to a passage of time, that option may be exercised only during certain periods.\n\nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) twenty-five dollars ($8,000 in the aggregate) plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price may be paid with cash, AT&amp;T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&amp;T common stock, at Mobility II's sole election. In no event shall Mobility II be required to deliver more than 250 million shares of AT&amp;T common stock to settle put and redemption options. We have the intent and ability to settle the Mobility preferred equity interests with cash.\n\n## Tower Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.",

These preferred interests were redeemed on November 6, 2020. (See Note 6)\n\nThe membership interests in PR Holdings consisted of (1) common interests, which were held by consolidated subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (PR preferred interests). The PR preferred interests paid an initial preferred distribution at an annual rate of 4.75%. Distributions were paid quarterly, subject to declaration.\n\n## NOTE 18. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and a deferred purchase price, and (2) revolving service and trade receivables. Under these programs, we transfer receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, where applicable. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to 'Total Assets' reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash receipts on the deferred purchase price are classified as cash flows from investing activities.",

(See Note 6)\n\nThe membership interests in PR Holdings consisted of (1) common interests, which were held by consolidated subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (PR preferred interests). The PR preferred interests paid an initial preferred distribution at an annual rate of 4.75%. Distributions were paid quarterly, subject to declaration.\n\n## NOTE 18. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and a deferred purchase price, and (2) revolving service and trade receivables. Under these programs, we transfer receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, where applicable. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to 'Total Assets' reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash receipts on the deferred purchase price are classified as cash flows from investing activities.",

      "question": "Given that CMCSA's Class B Common Stock is convertible share-for-share into Class A Common Stock with restrictions, and considering the voting power distribution and equity disclosures, how does the potential conversion of Class B shares impact the voting control structure and shareholder equity composition as reported in different sections of the 10-K?",
      "answer": "The Class B Common Stock, which is convertible into Class A Common Stock share-for-share with restrictions, holds 33 1/3% of the voting power in CMCSA, with each share entitled to 15 votes. This voting structure gives Class B shareholders significant influence despite their smaller quantity compared to Class A shares. If Class B shares were fully converted, the voting power would shift entirely to Class A, which currently holds 66 2/3% of the voting power. However, the equity section shows that as of December 31, 2023, there were only 9,444,375 Class B shares outstanding, compared to over 4.8 billion Class A shares. This suggests that while Class B shares have concentrated voting rights, their small number limits their overall impact on equity composition. The conversion would increase the number of Class A shares slightly but would not significantly alter the equity base, which totaled $82.7 billion in shareholder equity. The presence of Class B shares thus maintains a dual structure that preserves control while allowing for potential future alignment with Class A equity holders.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CMCSA](page_69) \u2192 [Class B Common Stock]: The equity section on page 69 discloses that Class B Common Stock is outstanding and shows the total shareholder equity, including the par value and number of shares issued and outstanding.",
        "Hop 2: [Class B Common Stock] \u2192 [Class A Common Stock]: According to the note on page 91, each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock on a share-for-share basis, subject to restrictions, and the two classes have different voting rights.",
        "Hop 3: [Class A Common Stock] \u2190 [CMCSA](page_1): On page 1, the document lists Class A Common Stock as a registered security, indicating its par value and the exchanges on which it is listed, which supports the structure and liquidity of the stock post-conversion."

      "answer": "The 28 million shares referenced in the disclosure on page 106 include all shares subject to outstanding performance stock units as of December 31, 2023, along with dividend equivalents accrued on such awards. This figure aligns with the broader context of the 2017 LTIP, which is the sole plan for issuing equity awards since May 2017. However, the detailed activity table on page 88 specifies that only 12,174,000 performance stock units were outstanding at the end of 2023. This discrepancy is explained by the fact that the 28 million figure encompasses both restricted stock units (15,852,000) and performance stock units (12,174,000), as well as dividend equivalents. The table further distinguishes between equity and liability awards, with only 276,000 liability awards for performance stock units remaining by year-end. Thus, the broader disclosure on page 106 aggregates multiple categories, while the table on page 88 provides a granular breakdown that isolates performance stock units.",

      "answer": "Disney identifies damage to its brands as a risk that could negatively impact sales, profitability, and brand reputation across businesses, including its DTC segment. Pixar is specifically called out in the DTC section as one of the top-level branded tiles within Disney+, serving as a critical differentiator in attracting and retaining subscribers. Since Pixar is also listed as an indefinite-lived intangible asset on page 110\u2014alongside Marvel and ESPN\u2014any reputational harm to Pixar could not only reduce subscriber growth and retention but also trigger an impairment review of this asset. This creates a direct link between brand risk in the DTC context and the financial valuation of intangible assets, showing how qualitative brand risks could manifest in tangible financial impacts.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nsuccessfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

On page 10, the filing reveals that ESPN+ is being bundled with Disney+ and Hulu as part of its domestic DTC offerings and that ESPN+ had approximately 26 million paid subscribers as of September 28, 2024. This subscriber growth supports the bundling strategy, which likely enhances customer retention and acquisition by offering greater value through combined entertainment and sports content.

      "answer": "The governance structure of Comcast is significantly influenced by the dual-class stock system. Class A common stockholders collectively hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while the Class B common stock, which has 15 votes per share, represents 33 1/3% of the voting power and is entirely owned by Mr. Brian L. Roberts. This structure ensures that Mr. Roberts maintains substantial control over corporate decisions despite holding a minority of the total shares. On page 69, it is noted that the Class B common stock has no issued or outstanding shares in terms of financial reporting, but its voting power remains non-dilutable under the company's articles of incorporation, reinforcing the governance influence of the Class B shares.",

      "question": "How does the 8% dividend increase approved in January 2022 for CMCSA's Class A common stock align with the structural voting power imbalance and special approval rights held by the Class B common stock, particularly in light of Brian L. Roberts' sole beneficial ownership of the Class B shares?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class A common stock received an 8% dividend increase in January 2022, signaling a positive return to shareholders. However, the Class A shares hold only 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, with the remaining 33 1/3% held by the Class B common stock, which has disproportionate influence due to its non-dilutable voting rights and special approval rights over major corporate transactions. Since Brian L. Roberts, the company\u2019s Chairman and CEO, is the sole beneficial owner of the Class B shares, he maintains significant control over strategic decisions, even though Class B shares can be converted into Class A shares on a one-for-one basis. This structure creates a misalignment between economic returns (as seen in the dividend increase) and voting control, which could impact shareholder dynamics and corporate governance decisions.",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate. Participants are eligible to receive distributions from their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.\n\nWe have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, net, was $549 million and $481 million, respectively.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nWe sponsor  several  401(k)  defined  contribution  retirement  plans  that  allow  eligible  employees  to  contribute  a  portion  of  their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines. We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees' contributions up to certain limits. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, expenses related to these plans totaled $595 million, $599 million and $573 million, respectively.\n\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We also participate in other multiemployer benefit plans that  provide health and welfare and retirement savings benefits to active and retired participants. If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or were to otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law would require us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by other participating  employers  may  lead  to  adverse  changes  in  the  financial  condition  of  one  of  these  plans,  which  could  result  in  an increase  in  our  withdrawal  liability.  Total  contributions  we  made  to  multiemployer  benefit  plans  and  any  potential  withdrawal liabilities were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Note 12: Equity\n\n## Common Stock\n\nIn the aggregate, holders of our Class A common stock have 66 /3% of the voting power of our common stock and holders of our Class B common stock have 33 /3% of the voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to 15 votes. The number of votes held by each share of our Class A common stock depends on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding at any given time. The 33 /3% aggregate voting power of our Class B common stock cannot be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of common stock. Our Class B common stock is convertible, share for share, into Class A common stock, subject to certain restrictions. 2 1 1\n\n## Shares of Common Stock Outstanding\n\n",

If  we  are  unable  to  reach  agreement  with  a  labor  union  before  the  expiration  of  a  collective  bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.\n\nIn  addition,  NBCUniversal's Media segment and Sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.\n\nOur Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced  below  9,444,375,  which  was  the  number  of  shares  of  Class  B  common  stock  outstanding  on  the  date  of  our  2002 acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp.'s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets)  or  issuances  of  securities  that  require  shareholder  approval,  transactions  that  result  in  any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles  of  incorporation  or  by-laws  that  would  limit  the  rights  of  holders  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Brian  L.  Roberts,  our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium. 1\n\n## Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 2: Properties\n\nWe believe that substantially all of our physical assets were in good operating condition as of December 31, 2021. Our corporate headquarters and Cable Communications segment headquarters are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at One Comcast Center. Additionally, the Comcast Technology Center, which is adjacent to the Comcast Center, is a center for Cable Communications' technology and engineering workforce, as well as the home of our NBCUniversal and Telemundo owned local broadcast stations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We also have leases for numerous business offices, warehouses and properties throughout the United States that house divisional information technology operations.\n\n## Cable Communications Segment\n\nOur  principal  physical  assets  consist  of  operating  plant  and  equipment,  including  cable  system  signal  receiving,  encoding  and decoding devices, headends and distribution networks. Our distribution network consists primarily of headends, content distribution servers,  coaxial  and  fiber-optic  cables,  lasers,  routers,  switches  and  related  electronic  equipment.  Our  cable  plant  and  related equipment generally are connected to utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities, although in some areas the  distribution  cable  is  buried  in  underground  ducts  or  trenches.  The  physical  components  of  cable  systems  require  periodic maintenance and replacement.\n\nOur cable system signal reception sites, which consist primarily of antenna towers and headends, and our microwave facilities are located on owned and leased parcels of land, and we own or lease space on the towers on which certain of our equipment is located. We own most of our service vehicles.\n\nOur broadband network consists of fiber-optic cables owned or leased by us and related equipment.

      "question": "Given Alphabet's 2023 share repurchase strategy focused on Class A and Class C shares, and the structural differences in how Class B shares are treated in diluted EPS calculations, how does the company's capital allocation approach align with its stated objective of maximizing value for all shareholders in 2023?",
      "answer": "Alphabet's 2023 repurchase strategy (page 81) explicitly prioritizes Class A and Class C shares based on 'relative trading prices and volumes,' with no mention of repurchasing Class B shares, which are 'neither listed nor traded' (page 26). However, the diluted EPS calculation (page 81) assumes conversion of Class B shares when calculating Class A EPS, but not vice versa, creating a structural asymmetry. While the company states repurchases are done in the 'best interest of the company and its stockholders,' the exclusion of Class B from both repurchases and full EPS conversion analysis could lead to disproportionate value creation for Class A/C holders relative to Class B holders, despite identical liquidation/dividend rights. This raises questions about whether the capital allocation strategy fully aligns with the stated objective of maximizing value for all shareholders equally.",

      "answer": "Disney's valuation of its A+E investment incorporates both the subscriber base of FYI, which stood at 42 million as of September 2022, and the company's broader strategic assessment of intangible assets. FYI, as part of A+E's portfolio, contributes to the revenue and brand strength of the joint venture, which Disney co-owns with Hearst. Despite this subscriber figure, Disney's equity investment in A+E carries an excess book value of approximately $0.8 billion over its share of the investee's underlying net assets. This premium reflects the company's recognition of intangible assets and goodwill, likely stemming from A+E's content library, brand equity, and distribution agreements. Therefore, the valuation is not solely based on current subscriber metrics but also on long-term strategic value drivers such as brand strength and content IP.",

Each Class B share has 15 votes, which allows this small group to maintain strategic control over major decisions like capital allocation. This governance structure likely enabled the Board to approve the $4.0 billion in Class A share repurchases during 2021 and the 8% dividend increase in January 2022 without facing opposition from broader Class A shareholders.

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks in the future, including the development of our additional theme  park  in  Orlando,  Florida,  which  resumed  in  2021.  Capital  expenditures  for  subsequent  years  will  depend  on  numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented  in  other  financing  activities,  repurchases  of  common  stock  under  our  share  repurchase  program  and  employee  plans, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Net cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted  primarily  of  repayments  of  debt  and  the  related  early  redemption  payments  presented  in  other  financing  activities, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented  in  other  financing  activities,  partially  offset  by  proceeds  from  borrowings  and  proceeds  from  the  settlement  of cross-currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities.\n\nIn August 2021, we completed a debt exchange transaction. We issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, which have maturities ranging from 2051 to 2063 and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.93%, and made cash payments of $0.5 billion in exchange for $11.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2033 to 2058 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.04%. The debt exchange resulted in an overall reduction in the weighted-average interest rate for our total outstanding debt of 0.27% and extended the overall weighted-average maturity by 2 years. The debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, and therefore following the exchange, the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments, and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes.\n\nIn 2021, we made debt repayments of $11.5 billion, including $4.9 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of $3.3 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025, as well as amounts due at maturity and the cash payments in the debt exchange transaction.\n\nIn 2021, we issued \u20ac1.75 billion ($2.1 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate Euro senior notes maturing in 2026 and 2029. In 2021, we had borrowings of $0.6 billion under the Universal Beijing Resort term loan.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. Effective May 25, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. During 2021, we repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion. In January 2022, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization from the $6 billion remaining as of December 31, 2021 to $10 billion. Under the authorization, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares, which may be in the open market or in private transactions.\n\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.6 billion in 2021. We paid dividends of $4.5 billion in 2021. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nThe  chart  below  summarizes  our  share  repurchases  under  our  publicly  announced  share  repurchase  program  authorization  and dividends paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, we paid $674 million and $534 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.",

      "answer": "Disney utilizes pay-fixed interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate obligations, but it did not have any such designated cash flow hedges at the end of fiscal 2024. This absence means that no unrealized gains or losses from these instruments were deferred in AOCI to smooth interest expense volatility. Meanwhile, the reported effective interest rate on floating-rate borrowings includes the impact of existing and terminated interest rate swaps, purchase accounting adjustments, and debt issuance premiums or discounts. Without active pay-fixed swaps to stabilize interest costs, the effective rate on floating-rate debt becomes more sensitive to current market conditions, as evidenced by the $0.9 billion market value adjustment for debt with qualifying hedges at September 28, 2024. This dynamic suggests a potentially higher volatility in interest expense going forward.",

The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions.

      "answer": "Disney has provided a 1.9 billion yuan ($0.3 billion) line of credit to Shanghai Disney Resort at an 8% interest rate, while Shendi has provided a larger 2.6 billion yuan ($0.4 billion) line of credit at the same interest rate. This indicates that Shendi, as the majority equity holder (57%), is committing more capital to support the resort\u2019s operations and growth. The identical interest rate suggests alignment in financial terms, but the larger credit facility from Shendi reflects its stronger financial backing in the partnership. This capital structure supports Disney\u2019s strategic role as a brand and operational partner, while Shendi assumes greater financial risk and commitment.",

      "answer": "Disney utilizes a VAR model to estimate financial risk exposure, excluding firm commitments from the calculation due to their forecasted and non-binding nature. However, the company actively hedges these firm commitments through foreign exchange contracts, as evidenced by the $9.9 billion notional amount of net foreign exchange cash flow hedges at September 28, 2024. This indicates a dual approach: the VAR model quantifies risk for existing financial instruments under normal market conditions, while the hedging strategy proactively manages the risk associated with firm commitments that are not included in the VAR model. This synthesis reveals a layered risk management framework where quantitative risk estimation complements strategic hedging of forward-looking exposures.",

      "question": "How does the voting power structure of Class B common stock, which is entirely owned by Brian Roberts, influence the reported repurchase activity and shareholder equity treatment of Class A common stock in the financial statements?",
      "answer": "The voting power structure of Class B common stock, where each share carries 15 votes and collectively holds 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, is designed to preserve Brian L. Roberts\u2019 control over CMCSA despite owning a small number of total shares. This control structure indirectly affects the repurchase activity and equity treatment of Class A common stock, as evidenced by the $2 billion in Class A stock repurchases during 2024. These repurchases reduced Class A common stock equity from $48 million to $47 million by year-end. Meanwhile, the Class B shares, which are non-dilutable and not subject to repurchase, remain constant at 9,444,375 shares, reinforcing the strategic governance design that prioritizes voting control while allowing for active management of Class A equity through repurchases.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA(page_67) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Discloses that 9,444,375 shares of Class B common stock are issued and outstanding, with no equity value assigned, indicating their primary role is governance control.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The Class B shares have 15 votes per share and represent 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, which preserves control for Brian L. Roberts, even as Class A shares are subject to repurchase and equity adjustments.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(page_68): Reports a reduction in Class A common stock equity from $48 million to $47 million due to $2 billion in repurchases during 2024, showing how the capital structure is actively managed despite the static nature of Class B shares."

      "answer": "The structure of CMCSA\u2019s dual-class stock system gives disproportionate influence to the holders of Class B common stock, despite their minority ownership stake. Class A shareholders collectively hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B shareholders hold a non-dilutable 33 1/3%, which can only decrease if the number of Class B shares falls below a specified threshold. Importantly, Class B shares have separate approval rights over several material transactions, including mergers, asset sales, and amendments to the articles of incorporation, even if such actions are approved by the Board or a majority of Class A shareholders. This means that the strategic direction of the company, including major transactions or governance changes, can be significantly constrained by the holder(s) of Class B shares\u2014in this case, Brian L. Roberts, who owns all outstanding Class B stock. Thus, while Class A shareholders represent the majority in ownership, the structural protections of Class B shares allow a single individual to exert outsized control over corporate decisions.",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

If  we  are  unable  to  reach  agreement  with  a  labor  union  before  the  expiration  of  a  collective  bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.\n\nIn  addition,  NBCUniversal's Media segment and Sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.\n\nOur Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced  below  9,444,375,  which  was  the  number  of  shares  of  Class  B  common  stock  outstanding  on  the  date  of  our  2002 acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp.'s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets)  or  issuances  of  securities  that  require  shareholder  approval,  transactions  that  result  in  any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles  of  incorporation  or  by-laws  that  would  limit  the  rights  of  holders  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Brian  L.  Roberts,  our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium. 1\n\n## Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 2: Properties\n\nWe believe that substantially all of our physical assets were in good operating condition as of December 31, 2021. Our corporate headquarters and Cable Communications segment headquarters are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at One Comcast Center. Additionally, the Comcast Technology Center, which is adjacent to the Comcast Center, is a center for Cable Communications' technology and engineering workforce, as well as the home of our NBCUniversal and Telemundo owned local broadcast stations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We also have leases for numerous business offices, warehouses and properties throughout the United States that house divisional information technology operations.\n\n## Cable Communications Segment\n\nOur  principal  physical  assets  consist  of  operating  plant  and  equipment,  including  cable  system  signal  receiving,  encoding  and decoding devices, headends and distribution networks. Our distribution network consists primarily of headends, content distribution servers,  coaxial  and  fiber-optic  cables,  lasers,  routers,  switches  and  related  electronic  equipment.  Our  cable  plant  and  related equipment generally are connected to utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities, although in some areas the  distribution  cable  is  buried  in  underground  ducts  or  trenches.  The  physical  components  of  cable  systems  require  periodic maintenance and replacement.\n\nOur cable system signal reception sites, which consist primarily of antenna towers and headends, and our microwave facilities are located on owned and leased parcels of land, and we own or lease space on the towers on which certain of our equipment is located. We own most of our service vehicles.\n\nOur broadband network consists of fiber-optic cables owned or leased by us and related equipment. We also operate national and regional data centers with equipment that is used to provide services, such as email and web services, to our broadband and",

      "question": "How does the treatment of Class A stock in share repurchase decisions relate to the lack of trading for Class B stock, and what does this imply about Alphabet's capital structure prioritization?",
      "answer": "Alphabet's repurchase program for Class A and Class C shares is executed based on economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including relative trading prices and volumes (page_81). This implies active market engagement for these classes. In contrast, Class B stock is neither listed nor traded (page_26), indicating a structural separation from market-based capital allocation decisions. The computation of diluted net income per share for Class A assumes conversion of Class B shares, while Class B calculations do not assume such conversion (page_81), reinforcing the primacy of Class A in financial reporting and capital return strategies. Together, this highlights a prioritization of Class A shares in both operational execution (repurchases) and financial presentation (EPS), while Class B remains insulated from market dynamics, likely preserving internal ownership control.",

        "Hop 2: [Class A Stock] \u2192 [Class B Stock]: Class B shares are not included in the repurchase program and are not publicly traded, and their dilutive effect is asymmetrically treated in EPS calculations, showing structural differentiation.",
        "Hop 3: [Class B Stock] \u2190 [GOOGL](page_26): Class B stock is neither listed nor traded, reinforcing its role as a non-market-determined ownership vehicle, in contrast to the actively managed Class A shares."

      "answer": "The DTC business faces significant risks related to brand damage, where negative publicity or consumer dissatisfaction with one brand could spill over and impact other businesses, including subscriber retention and brand perception (page 29). Disney+\u2014a core component of the DTC strategy\u2014explicitly includes National Geographic branded programming as a top-level tile in its interface, directly tying the National Geographic brand to Disney\u2019s DTC subscriber experience (page 12). Furthermore, Disney holds a 73% interest in National Geographic domestically and a controlling stake internationally, meaning its financial performance is directly consolidated into Disney\u2019s financials (page 78). Therefore, any reputational risk associated with National Geographic content could not only affect subscriber trust and retention in the DTC segment but also directly impact Disney\u2019s financial results, creating a dual exposure point where brand and financial risk are interlinked through the National Geographic stake and its prominent placement within Disney+.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nsuccessfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 18).\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\n## Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution\n\nDMED encompasses the Company's global film and episodic television content production and distribution activities. Content is distributed by a single organization across three significant lines of business: Linear Networks, Direct-toConsumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Content is generally created/licensed by four groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. The distribution organization has full accountability for the financial results of the entire media and entertainment business.\n\nThe operations of DMED's significant lines of business are as follows:\n\n- Linear Networks\n- Domestic Channels: ABC Television Network and eight owned ABC television stations (Broadcasting), and Disney, ESPN (80% interest), Freeform, FX and National Geographic (73% interest) branded domestic television networks (Cable)\n- International Channels: Disney, ESPN, Fox, National Geographic and Star branded television networks outside the U.S.\n- A 50% equity investment in A+E Television Networks (A+E), which operates a variety of cable channels including A&amp;E, HISTORY and Lifetime\n- Direct-to-Consumer\n- Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, ESPN+ (68% effective interest), Hulu and Star+ direct-to-consumer (DTC) video streaming services\n- Content Sales/Licensing\n- Sale/licensing of film and television content to third-party television and subscription/advertising video-on-demand (TV/SVOD) services\n- Theatrical distribution\n- Home entertainment distribution (DVD, Blu-ray discs and electronic home video licenses)\n- Music distribution",

      "answer": "Shendi provided Shanghai Disney Resort with a 2.6 billion yuan ($0.4 billion) line of credit bearing interest at 8%, with no balance currently outstanding. In contrast, Disney provided Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with a HK$2.7 billion ($347 million) revolving credit facility bearing interest at three-month HIBOR plus 1.25%, maturing in December 2028, also with no balance outstanding. While both facilities are interest-bearing and unused at present, Shendi's line carries a fixed rate of 8%, whereas Disney's facility uses a floating rate tied to HIBOR.

      "answer": "The inclusion of Marvel-branded programming within Disney+ services underscores Marvel's strategic importance to Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer platform, which is central to its future growth. However, since Marvel is listed as an indefinite-lived intangible asset valued alongside ESPN and Pixar trademarks on page 110, any reputational or brand damage to Marvel could have broader implications for Disney\u2019s brand portfolio and financial valuation. The risk factors section on page 29 highlights that damage to one brand could negatively affect other businesses and brands across the company, especially given the interconnected nature of Disney\u2019s globally recognized brands. Therefore, the reliance on Marvel content within Disney+ introduces a dual-edged risk: while it enhances the platform\u2019s appeal, any negative perception or damage to Marvel could not only reduce subscriber engagement but also impair the value of a key intangible asset, thereby impacting Disney\u2019s overall financial health and brand equity.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nsuccessfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

      "answer": "CMCSA's capital structure shows that Class A common stock had 4,651,093,045 shares issued in 2024, while Class B common stock had only 9,444,375 issued and outstanding shares. Despite both classes being outstanding, all stock repurchases in 2024 were limited to Class A shares, totaling $2 billion in reductions to additional paid-in capital and $7,251 million in reductions to retained earnings. This suggests a strategic focus on managing Class A share count while preserving the concentrated voting power of Class B shares, which carry 15 votes each and are entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, ensuring continued control over key corporate decisions.",

      "answer": "Disney identifies brand damage in one business as potentially impacting performance across other businesses due to the interconnected nature of its globally recognized brands (page 29). This risk is particularly relevant given that Disney+\u2014a key part of its DTC strategy\u2014includes Marvel content as a top-level tile in its interface, directly linking Marvel\u2019s brand strength to subscriber attraction and retention (page 12). Furthermore, Marvel is listed among Disney\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets, alongside Pixar and ESPN, indicating its long-term strategic and financial value to the company (page 110). Therefore, any reputational harm to the Marvel brand could not only affect Disney+ subscriber metrics but also diminish the value of a significant intangible asset, thereby impacting overall financial stability and DTC profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nsuccessfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

      "answer": "The $21.7 billion in 2023 stock-based compensation expenses under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan primarily involves Class C stock awards, which contributes to dilution pressure from RSUs vesting over time. To offset this dilution and optimize shareholder value, Alphabet repurchases both Class A and Class C shares based on market conditions and relative trading prices. Despite differing voting rights, both share classes have identical dividend and liquidation rights, ensuring equitable treatment in earnings allocation. The repurchase strategy for Class A shares, therefore, complements the company's broader capital allocation approach by balancing the dilutive impact of Class C stock awards while maintaining proportionate value distribution across share classes.",

      "question": "Why are forecasted foreign currency transactions included in Disney's foreign exchange hedging program but excluded from the Value at Risk (VAR) model, and how does this exclusion affect the company's overall assessment of financial risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Disney actively hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions as part of its foreign exchange risk management strategy, with $9.9 billion in notional amounts of net foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of September 28, 2024. These forecasted transactions are intended to be protected against exchange rate fluctuations through forward and option contracts. However, the company explicitly excludes forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and foreign currency receivables/payables from its Value at Risk (VAR) model, which focuses only on financial instruments like derivatives and market-sensitive equity investments. The VAR model estimates a maximum one-day loss of $255 million at fiscal year-end 2024. By excluding forecasted transactions from the VAR model, Disney does not incorporate the potential volatility or risk associated with these future transactions into its quantitative risk metric, even though they are actively hedged. This creates a divergence between the company's proactive hedging strategy and its formal risk measurement framework, suggesting that the VAR model may understate the full scope of foreign exchange risk the company manages.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "question": "What are the implications of the non-dilutable voting power structure of Class B common stock on the equity presentation and capital structure of CMCSA, particularly considering the disparity in issued shares between Class A and Class B?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's capital structure includes two classes of common stock with a distinct voting rights framework. Class B common stock, although representing only 9,444,375 issued and outstanding shares compared to 4,842,108,959 Class A shares, holds 33\u2153% of the total voting power, which is non-dilutable under the company's articles of incorporation. Each Class B share is entitled to 15 votes, and the class can convert share-for-share into Class A stock, although this conversion is subject to restrictions. Despite the significant numerical disparity\u2014where Class A shares vastly outnumber Class B\u2014the latter retains a disproportionately large influence on corporate governance. This structure ensures that holders of Class B common stock maintain a consistent governance position regardless of future issuances of Class A shares. The equity section of the balance sheet reflects this arrangement by separately disclosing Class A and Class B shares, with Class A shares having a par value of $0.01 and a larger issued quantity, while Class B shares, also with a $0.01 par value, are limited in issuance and carry enhanced voting rights.",

        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Notes that Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares on a one-for-one basis and highlights the non-dilutable 33\u2153% voting power of Class B shares, with each share entitled to 15 votes, in contrast to the more diluted voting rights of Class A shareholders.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(page_69): Details the actual number of issued and outstanding shares for both classes, showing that Class B constitutes only 9,444,375 shares versus over 4.8 billion for Class A, while still maintaining significant voting control."

      "answer": "Disney reported a 40% increase in programming and production costs for ESPN+ and other services in 2022, rising from $1.121 billion in 2021 to $1.564 billion in 2022. This increase was partly attributed to ESPN\u2019s strategic emphasis on college sports content, which includes ESPNU\u2014a channel dedicated to college athletics. Despite this investment, ESPNU had 51 million subscribers in 2022, significantly lower than ESPN and ESPN2\u2019s 74 million subscribers. This suggests that while Disney is increasing spending on college sports programming, the subscriber base for ESPNU has not reached the same level as its flagship ESPN channels, raising questions about the effectiveness of this investment in reaching broader audiences for college sports.",

      "answer": "Disney's strategy of bundling ESPN+ with Disney+ and Hulu aims to drive subscriber growth for ESPN+ by leveraging the broader Disney ecosystem. ESPN+ offers live sports and on-demand content, and as of September 2024, had approximately 26 million paid subscribers. This bundling strategy likely enhances ESPN+'s distribution and monetization potential through combined subscription models. Meanwhile, ABC Network pays ESPN for programming rights, as noted in the Sports segment section, where fees paid by ABC Network to ESPN are recognized in segment revenues and later eliminated in consolidation. ESPN's operating expenses include significant programming and production costs, particularly for licensed sports rights. The financial interdependency arises because ESPN's ability to secure and retain valuable sports rights depends on revenue generated through these internal arrangements with ABC Network and other Disney segments. Therefore, ESPN+'s subscriber growth strategy must be evaluated in the context of how ESPN's broader programming costs are subsidized by internal payments from ABC Network, which itself relies on affiliate fees charged to MVPDs for the right to deliver its programming, including content from ESPN.",

      "question": "How does Netflix balance its low-cost international pricing strategy with the risk of third-party content providers withdrawing popular titles on short notice, particularly in markets where content licensing challenges are more pronounced?",
      "answer": "Netflix offers a range of membership plans internationally, with prices varying from $1 to $32 per month depending on the country and plan features (page 22). This pricing model includes low-cost plans aimed at price-sensitive markets. However, Netflix's ability to provide compelling content depends on licenses from third-party content providers, which can withdraw content on short notice due to contractual provisions or strategic decisions, such as launching their own streaming platforms (page 10). Additionally, content licensing becomes more complex in certain jurisdictions due to regulatory requirements like content quotas and levies (page 4), which may exacerbate the risk of content unavailability. By maintaining a diverse and original content portfolio and selectively renewing titles, Netflix attempts to mitigate the impact of content withdrawal while keeping its service attractive at lower price points across different regions.",

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

      "question": "Given the non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power of Class B common stock and its conversion mechanism into Class A shares, how does the absence of issued Class B shares in 2023 affect the overall voting power distribution compared to historical issuance patterns reflected in equity disclosures?",
      "answer": "The absence of issued Class B shares in 2023 eliminates the non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power block that Class B shares typically provide, shifting full voting control to Class A shareholders who previously held 66 2/3% of the voting power. This contrasts with historical patterns where Class B shares maintained a fixed 33 1/3% voting stake regardless of issuance levels of Class A shares. The equity disclosures on page 69 show zero issued Class B shares in 2023, compared to their presence in prior disclosures, which indicates a structural shift in shareholder control dynamics. Without Class B shares, the voting power previously concentrated in Class B is redistributed among Class A shareholders, altering governance influence.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(page_1) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Discloses that Class A Common Stock has 66 2/3% of the voting power, with Class B having the remaining 33 1/3%, and notes the existence of Class B shares as a distinct class.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The voting power structure is defined by the proportional relationship between the two classes, with Class B shares holding a non-dilutable 33 1/3% and being convertible into Class A shares.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(page_69): Discloses that as of 2023, no Class B shares were issued or outstanding, contrasting with prior disclosures where Class B shares were present and maintained a fixed voting stake."

      "question": "Given the concentrated voting power of Brian L. Roberts through Class B common stock and the significant repurchase activity of Class A common stock in 2024, how does the company's equity structure reflect a potential imbalance in governance influence versus shareholder value distribution?",
      "answer": "The equity structure of CMCSA reveals a governance framework where Brian L. Roberts, through ownership of all outstanding Class B common stock, holds 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. This concentrated voting power contrasts with the company's financial activities around Class A common stock, which saw repurchases of $2 billion in 2024. Despite these repurchases reducing the number of outstanding Class A shares (from 4,842,108,959 to 4,651,093,045), the governance structure remains unaffected due to the non-dilutive nature of Class B voting rights. This dynamic suggests that while shareholder value is being redistributed through stock repurchases, the core governance influence remains insulated, creating a potential misalignment between ownership benefits and control.",

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class  B  common stock having 15 votes per share.  The  Class  B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\n## Div idends\n\nWe expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

      "question": "Given the SEC Network's subscriber base of 45 million and its position within the ESPN portfolio, how does the antitrust litigation risk facing ESPN potentially affect the financial viability of college sports programming rights like those held by the SEC Network?",
      "answer": "The SEC Network, with 45 million subscribers, is a key part of Disney's ESPN portfolio, which incurs significant programming and production costs, including amortization of licensed sports rights. The antitrust lawsuits against ESPN and its parent company raise concerns about the future of its carriage agreements and the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny on its pricing and bundling practices. These legal challenges, particularly the consolidated class action and the Fubo lawsuit, threaten to disrupt ESPN's distribution model and increase costs, which could impact its ability to maintain or renew expensive programming rights, such as those for SEC college athletics. If the litigation results in restrictions on ESPN's business practices or significant financial penalties, it could lead to a reevaluation of high-cost programming assets like the SEC Network, directly affecting its financial viability.",

      "question": "How does the subscriber base of ESPNU influence Disney's treatment of ESPN as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, especially in light of the significant programming rights and associated costs outlined in the Sports segment?",
      "answer": "ESPNU, as one of ESPN\u2019s branded channels, has 47 million subscribers, contributing to the broader ESPN network\u2019s subscriber base and overall revenue-generating capacity. This subscriber count is a key factor in assessing the strength and reach of ESPN\u2019s platform, which is central to justifying its classification as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Furthermore, the Sports segment details substantial programming and production costs tied to high-profile sports rights such as the NFL, NBA, MLB, and college football playoffs \u2014 all of which are used across ESPN networks, including ESPNU, to produce content. These rights and the associated subscriber base support the long-term revenue assumptions necessary for ESPN\u2019s indefinite-lived asset classification. Therefore, the combination of subscriber metrics and the strategic value of exclusive programming rights underpins Disney\u2019s decision to treat ESPN as an intangible asset with indefinite life, rather than one subject to amortization.",
