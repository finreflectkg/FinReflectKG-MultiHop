      "question": "How does Netflix's increased investment in original content production, as evidenced by rising amortization and production costs, align with their significant future content obligations and cash usage priorities, particularly in light of their $5 billion stock repurchase authorization?",
      "answer": "Netflix's investment in original content production increased significantly, with content amortization rising by $1.4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, and production-related costs growing by $633 million (page 25). This aligns with their substantial future content obligations, which they estimate could include $1 billion to $4 billion in payments over the next three years for unknown future titles, with most payments expected beyond the next twelve months (page 29). Despite these obligations and the cash-intensive nature of original content production, Netflix authorized a $5 billion stock repurchase program in March 2021, of which $4.4 billion remained available as of December 31, 2021 (page 28). This suggests a strategic balance between investing in content to drive growth and returning capital to shareholders, assuming sufficient cash flow and financing access.",

Other costs of revenues increased $633 million, primarily due to the continued growth in our content production activities, coupled with an increase in expenses associated with streaming delivery costs and payment processing fees driven by our growing member base. The decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from 61% to 58% is primarily due to delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the growth in revenue.\n\n## Marketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2) Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n- (3) See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $366 million which has been included above. Total lease obligations as of December 31, 2021 increased $677 million from $2,839 million as of December 31, 2020 to $3,516 million as of December 31, 2021 due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $203 million, of which $39 million was classified in 'Other non-current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like share repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\n\n",

The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,408 million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $18,638 million. As of December 31, 2021, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased 1,182,410 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million. As of December 31, 2021, $4.4 billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content are in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. Expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Netflix's increased investment in original content production, as evidenced by pandemic-driven payment timing shifts, relate to the complexities in amortization accounting that require auditor validation of estimated viewing patterns?",
      "answer": "Netflix's increased investment in original content production in 2021, with content payments rising $4,933 million (39%) compared to a more modest $1,423 million (13%) increase in amortization expense, reflects a growing gap between upfront cash outlays and accounting charges. This discrepancy is tied to the company's amortization methodology, which relies on estimated viewing patterns that auditors specifically tested through sensitivity analyses and comparisons of prior estimates to actual results. The audit procedures highlighted the subjective nature of amortization, particularly for original content where forecasting long-term viewership trends introduces material uncertainty that could affect financial reporting timing and accuracy.",

The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party 'cloud' computing services. As we scale our content production, including now games, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. Further, we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control.

To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Our business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\n\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management's time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\n## We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices.

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit            | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |",

      "question": "How does Netflix's legal exposure to content providers, as seen in litigation risks and licensing constraints, align with the increased production costs and pandemic-related delays in content availability, and how does this impact their overall content investment strategy as reflected in cash flow and amortization trends?",
      "answer": "Netflix faces legal risks tied to content licensing, including potential unavailability of content due to unfavorable licensing terms or disputes with rights holders, which could disrupt service and increase costs (page_11). These risks are compounded by pandemic-related production delays, which caused a $4,933 million increase in content payments in 2021 as production schedules shifted (page_30). Additionally, the company incurred higher operating costs, including delays and additional expenses related to original content production, which were further exacerbated by industry-wide risks such as guild payments and talent-related uncertainties (page_8). Despite these challenges, Netflix continues to invest heavily in content, with content amortization rising from $10,807 million to $12,230 million in 2021, indicating a sustained commitment to original and exclusive programming as a core strategy to maintain subscriber growth and retention.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

The full extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the effect on our members and consumer demand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees' ability to work and travel; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming. Such production pauses have in the past, and may in the future, cause us to delay content releases and temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions can result in additional costs to production, including additional pay to cast and crew. Also, Covid-related delays and production protocols and requirements, including use of PPE and testing, add to costs of production.\n\nWe will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, members, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nIn addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy may continue to be impacted as a result of the actions taken in response to COVID-19. To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers' ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors' ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operations negatively impacted.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we have expanded our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk, which risks have been heightened during Covid-19. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.  We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising",

The payments for content assets increased $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, or 39%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,423 million, from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, or 13%. The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

The agreement was originally entered into on July 27, 2017, and has undergone two amendments, the most recent of which was on June 17, 2021, indicating ongoing adjustments to its terms (page_66). Despite having this facility available, Netflix had not drawn any amounts under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021, and instead focused on other capital activities such as debt repayment and stock repurchases, suggesting a conservative liquidity approach (page_28). Together, these elements show that Netflix maintains access to liquidity but has chosen to rely on operational cash flows and existing resources, reflecting a financially cautious strategy amid content investment growth.",

Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 17, 2026, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2021, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the 'Alternate Base Rate') or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the 'Adjusted LIBO Rate'), plus a margin of 0.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus 0.500% and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-month interest period, plus 1.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than 0.00% per annum. Regulatory authorities that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of 2021, they would no longer compel banks currently reporting information used to set the Adjusted LIBO Rate to continue to make rate submissions, and that publication of the Adjusted LIBO Rate based upon U.S. Dollars is expected to cease on June 30, 2023. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary provisions for the replacement of the Adjusted LIBO Rate with an alternate benchmark rate, including a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as the Adjusted LIBO Rate is phased out in the lending market. The Company does not anticipate that the replacement of the Adjusted LIBO Rate with such alternative benchmark rate, as provided in the Revolving Credit Agreement, will materially impact its liquidity or financial position.\n\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of 0.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\n## 7. Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Content\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $23.2 billion of obligations comprised of $4.3 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $3.1 billion of \"Non-current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $15.8 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $19.2 billion of obligations comprised of $4.4 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $2.6 billion of \"Non-current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $12.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:\n\n",

The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,408 million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $18,638 million. As of December 31, 2021, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased 1,182,410 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million. As of December 31, 2021, $4.4 billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content are in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. Expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n",

The  increase  was  due  to  growth  in revenues  partially  offset  by  increases  in  TAC,  content  acquisition  costs,  compensation  expenses,  advertising  and promotional expenses, and charges related to certain legal matters. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment. The effect of COVID-19 on 2020 results affected the year-over-year increase in operating income.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud operating loss decreased $2.5 billion from 2020 to 2021. The decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by growth in revenues, partially offset by an increase in expenses, primarily driven by compensation expenses. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nOther Bets operating loss increased $805 million from 2020 to 2021.

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n- Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n- Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\n\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\n\nThe main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:\n\n- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;\n- depreciation; and\n- professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\n\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain  customer service functions; and\n- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\n\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  in  finance,  human  resources,  information  technology,  legal,  and  other administrative support functions;\n- expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n- professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.",

Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.\n\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, for compensation  and  related  costs,  and  for  content  acquisition  costs.  In  addition,  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities include hardware inventory costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the net effect of an increase in cash received from revenues and cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\n\n## Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and non-marketable  securities.  Cash  used  in  investing  activities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  nonmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in maturities and sales of marketable securities, an increase in purchases of property and equipment, offset by a decrease in purchases of nonmarketable securities.\n\n## Cash Used in Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of  interest  in  consolidated  entities.  Cash  used  in  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  repurchases  of  common  and capital stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash payments for repurchases of common and capital stock.\n\n## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements\n\nWe  expect  existing  cash,  cash  equivalents,  short-term  marketable  securities,  cash  flows  from  operations  and financing  activities  to  continue  to  be  sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for  investing  and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of Class C Capital Stock across financial statements, capital structure disclosures, and exhibit documentation collectively reflect Alphabet Inc.'s equity strategy and governance structure?",
      "answer": "The financial statements on page 53 show that Class C Capital Stock, alongside Common Stock, plays a role in equity changes through stock-based compensation, repurchases, and tax withholding adjustments, with a balance of $61,774 million as of December 31, 2021. Page 2 discloses that as of January 25, 2022, there were 315,639,479 shares of Class C Capital Stock outstanding, indicating its material presence in the company's capital structure. Page 90 further contextualizes this by listing the Specimen Class C Capital Stock certificate as an exhibit, showing regulatory and structural importance in corporate governance. Together, these perspectives suggest a deliberate use of Class C shares to manage equity compensation, capital structure flexibility, and shareholder rights within a governed framework.",

      "question": "How does Google's strategic emphasis on growing non-advertising revenue through Google Play align with its monetization metrics and revenue recognition practices, especially considering the increasing importance of app sales and in-app purchases in driving financial performance?",
      "answer": "Google's strategic focus on expanding non-advertising revenue through Google Play is evident in its increasing investment in products like Google Play, which is highlighted as a key growth driver alongside Google Cloud and hardware. In terms of monetization, Google Play contributes to paid clicks and user engagement metrics, which are critical for tracking advertising performance across Google-owned properties like Gmail, Maps, and Play. Financially, Google Play's revenue from app sales and in-app purchases is recognized on a net basis due to Google's role as an intermediary, which impacts reported revenue figures and gross margin calculations. This multi-faceted perspective shows how Google Play is strategically positioned for growth, operationally tracked through engagement metrics, and financially reported with specific accounting judgments that affect overall revenue visibility and profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInternational  revenues  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  in  foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by  our  total  number  of  impressions,  and  represents  the  average  amount  we  charge  advertisers  for  each  impression displayed to users.\n\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting  the  number  of  paid  clicks  and  the  number  of  impressions,  and  for  identifying  the  revenues  generated  by  the corresponding click and impression activity.\n\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &amp; other properties  and  the  change  in  impressions  and  cost-per-impression  on  Google  Network  properties  and  the  correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n\n- advertiser competition for keywords;\n- changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n- changes in device mix;\n- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n- fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;\n- general economic conditions, including the effect of COVID-19;\n- seasonality; and\n- traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.\n\n## Google Other\n\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;\n- Devices and Services, which includes sales of hardware, including Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n- YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n- other products and services.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n- Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and\n- other enterprise services.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.",

Revenues  related  to  cloud  services  provided  on  a  consumption  basis  are  recognized  when  the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\n\n## Google Other Revenues\n\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\n- Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;\n- hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n- YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n- other products and services.\n\nAs it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net  basis  because  our  performance  obligation  is  to  facilitate  a  transaction  between  app  developers  and  end  users,  for which we earn a service fee.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  may  include  multiple  performance  obligations.  For  such  arrangements,  we  allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred and when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).",

      "question": "How does Google's expectation of increasing Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) paid to Google Network Partners relate to both the structure of its advertising revenue recognition and the cost structure of its advertising segments, particularly in comparison to Google Search properties?",
      "answer": "Google expects TAC paid to Google Network Partners to increase as advertising revenues grow, with the TAC rate being influenced by factors like device mix, geographic mix, and partner agreements. This expectation aligns with the revenue recognition model where Google reports advertising revenues from Google Network properties on a gross basis, meaning it bills the advertiser and pays a portion to the partner as cost of revenue. Additionally, the cost of revenues as a percentage of ad revenue is significantly higher for Google Network properties compared to Google Search properties because most of the revenue from the former is paid out as TAC. This creates a dynamic where growth in Google Network advertising revenue increases both gross revenue and cost of revenues, but with lower margin contribution compared to Google Search, affecting overall profitability trends.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with 'Note about Forward-Looking Statements,' Part I, Item 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe have omitted discussion of 2019 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item 7 of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results\n\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services  and  Google  Cloud;  we  also  report  all  non-Google  businesses  collectively  as  Other  Bets.  Other  Bets  include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 'Business' and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\n\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:\n\n- Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\n\nThe continuing shift  from  an  offline  to  online  world  has  contributed  to  the  growth  of  our  business  since  inception, contributing to revenue growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.\n\n- Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats.\n\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\nWe are increasingly generating advertising revenues from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins on advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those  from  traditional  desktop  search. Additionally,  as  the  market  for  a  particular  device  type  or  modality  matures,  our revenues  may  be  affected.  For  example,  growth  in  the  global  smartphone  market  has  slowed  due  to  various  factors, including  increased  market  saturation  in  developed  countries,  which  can  affect  our  mobile  advertising  revenue  growth rates.\n\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\n\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our margins.\n\n- As  online  advertising  evolves,  we  continue  to  expand  our  product  offerings,  which  may  affect  our monetization.\n\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve these changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play, which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads.\n\n- As  users  in  developing  economies  increasingly  come  online,  our  revenues  from  international  markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\n\nThe shift  to  online,  as  well  as  the  advent  of  the  multi-device  world,  has  brought  opportunities  outside  of  the  U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and  advertising  programs  relevant  to  our  users  in  these  markets.  This  has  led  to  a  trend  of  increased  revenues  from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Alphabet Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties, including the effects of COVID-19. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets, and goodwill; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn  January  2021,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and adjusted the estimated useful life  of  our  servers  from  three  years  to  four  years  and  the  estimated  useful  life  of  certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $2.6 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion, or $3.02 per basic share and $2.98 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility  of  an  amount  that  we  expect  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services  is  probable.  Sales  and  other  similar taxes are excluded from revenues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\n- Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use  Google.com  as  their  default  search  in  browsers,  toolbars,  etc.  and  other  Google  owned  and  operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  advertising  inventory  through  Google  Ads,  Google  Ad  Manager,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.",

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.

      "answer": "AT&T's strategic collaboration with Ericsson on Open RAN deployment, announced in December 2023, aims to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and scale Open RAN across its wireless network starting in 2024. This initiative is expected to pressure 2024 expense trends due to the spending required for deployment. Additionally, the deployment of Open RAN is projected to result in approximately $850 million in increased depreciation expense in 2024 due to the accelerated replacement of wireless equipment. This reflects a dual impact where strategic investment in Open RAN supports long-term efficiency and innovation while simultaneously increasing near-term costs related to network upgrades and depreciation.",

      "answer": "AT&T's repurchase of the Mobility preferred interests in April 2023 removed a dilutive effect on earnings per share that existed prior to the repurchase, as the interests were previously factored into diluted earnings per share calculations under ASU 2020-06. Additionally, the repurchase settled a liquidity obligation tied to the put option exercised by the AT&T pension trust, which required AT&T to pay $5,414 to repurchase the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests. This final repurchase concluded a process that had already seen $2,600 paid in October 2022 and had previously resulted in a reclassification of $5,340 of the interests from equity to liabilities on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.",

On December 27, 2022, the AT&T pension trust provided written notice of its right to require us to purchase the remaining 213 million, or approximately $5,340, of Mobility preferred interests outstanding. The terms of the instruments limited the amount we were required to redeem in any 12-month period to approximately 107 million shares, or $2,670. With the certainty of redemption, the Mobility preferred interests were reclassified from equity to a liability at fair value, with approximately $2,670 recorded in current liabilities as 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities,' representing the amount required to be redeemed within one year, and $2,670 recorded in 'Other noncurrent liabilities.' The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Notes 12 and 14). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interest for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414. |\n| Tower Holdings Preferred Interests In 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the 'Tower preferred interests'). The September series (Tower Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals $1,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and the December series (Tower Class A-2) totals $4,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning five years from the issuance date or upon the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the underlying assets. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Telco LLC Preferred Interests In September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunication-related assets.

      "answer": "AT&T's financial relationship with DIRECTV shows a consistent stream of equity income, with $1,666 million recognized in 2023, down from $1,808 million in 2022 and up significantly from $619 million in 2021. This reflects DIRECTV's ongoing contribution to AT&T's earnings. Additionally, amortization expense related to intangible assets was $184 million in 2023, with a projected decline over the next five years, indicating long-term asset valuation considerations. The reconciliation of equity investments on page 69 clarifies that DIRECTV was only included in AT&T's financials from August 1, 2021, onward, aligning with the formation of the new company with TPG and the shift to equity method accounting. Together, these perspectives illustrate a strategic deconsolidation and financial repositioning of DIRECTV, with ongoing material influence but reduced direct control.",

      "answer": "AT&T uses interest rate locks to hedge against increases in benchmark interest rates before issuing fixed-rate debt, designating these instruments as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses from settled interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt, with $59 expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to 'Interest expense' over the next 12 months. These interest rate locks are part of a broader derivative strategy that includes interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps, used to manage both interest rate and foreign exchange risks.

The increase in impressions was due to Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar growth, in part reflecting the launches of the ad-supported Disney+ service domestically in December 2022 and internationally starting in November 2023 and airing more cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar. There were two significant International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year.\n\n## Revenues - Other\n\nThe increase in other revenue was due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nIn addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business: (1)\n\nPaid subscribers at:\n\n",

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.\n\n## DTC PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS, KEY DEFINITIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nIn the U.S., Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or as part of various multi-product offerings. Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which was available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering. Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.\n\n## Paid Subscribers\n\nPaid subscribers reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Certain product offerings provide the option for an extra member to be added to an account (extra member add-on). These extra members are not counted as paid subscribers. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to multi-product offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each of the Company's services included in the multi-product offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ services. In Latin America prior to July 2024, if a subscriber had either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribed to Combo+, the subscriber was counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. Subscribers include those who receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements, including those for which the service is available to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.\n\n## International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)\n\nInternational Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\n## Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber\n\nHulu and ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses), premium and feature add-on revenue and extra member add-on revenue but excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN+ multiproduct offering. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.",

      "question": "How does Disney's treatment of Asia Theme Parks borrowings in terms of interest rates, maturity structure, and consolidation impact the overall assessment of their debt profile and financial obligations?",
      "answer": "Disney's Asia Theme Parks borrowings involve distinct interest rates, maturity schedules, and consolidation dynamics that shape their broader debt profile. The Asia Theme Parks borrowings totaled $1.292 billion as of September 28, 2024, with a stated interest rate of 7.93% and effective rate of 5.75%, indicating some interest rate mitigation through swaps or favorable refinancing terms. These borrowings include HK$0.5 billion ($68 million) from HKSAR at HIBOR + 2% maturing in September 2025, and 8.6 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) from Shendi at 8% maturing in 2036, with early repayment tied to cash flows. Looking ahead, the consolidated borrowings schedule shows that Asia Theme Parks borrowings contribute $128 million in 2025 and $1.164 billion thereafter, indicating minimal near-term repayment pressure but a significant long-term liability. This mix of short-term and long-term obligations, combined with the consolidated presentation, affects how Disney's overall debt burden and liquidity risk is perceived, especially when compared to their larger U.S. dollar denominated notes and cruise ship financings.",

      "answer": "The 'Parks licensing and other' category saw a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue, rising from $2.107 billion in 2023 to $2.259 billion in 2024. This growth aligns with the broader Experiences segment\u2019s capital investment strategy, which has focused heavily on parks and experiences, including expansions at EPCOT (such as the June 2024 opening of CommuniCore Hall and Plaza), the upcoming retheming of DinoLand USA into Tropical Americas by 2027, and continued development of sponsored attractions at Walt Disney World Resort. The revenue growth in 'Parks licensing and other' is specifically driven by income from sponsorships, co-branding opportunities, real estate rent, and royalties earned on Tokyo Disney Resort revenues, all of which are detailed as key components of this revenue line.",

      "question": "How does Disney's strategic decision to merge Star+ with Disney+ in Latin America align with its broader international DTC strategy and financial reporting of subscription revenue per paid subscriber?",
      "answer": "Disney's decision to merge Star+ with Disney+ in Latin America, as of July 2024, reflects a strategic move to consolidate its streaming offerings under a single brand, aligning with its international DTC strategy of simplifying product structure and enhancing user experience. This decision is consistent with the company's broader approach to streamline multi-product offerings and improve customer retention. Financially, the change impacts the reporting of average monthly revenue per paid subscriber, as the merged service will now be counted under Disney+, which uses a daily average method for subscriber calculation and allocates revenue based on relative standalone pricing. This integration likely affects revenue attribution and subscriber count metrics previously applied separately to Disney+ and Star+ in that region.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [DIS](page_57) \u2192 [Star]: The document notes that in Latin America prior to July 2024, Disney offered both Disney+ and Star+ as standalone services or in combination (Combo+), and subscribers were counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber regardless of whether they had Star+. The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber was calculated using a daily average method for Disney+ and allocated revenue based on relative pricing.",
        "Hop 2: [DIS](page_78) \u2192 [Star]: Star is referenced as part of the international general entertainment television channels under the Entertainment segment, which includes Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, and Hulu. This segment includes subscription fees as a key revenue source, and Star+ would have contributed to this revenue prior to the merger.",
        "Hop 3: [DIS](page_4) \u2192 [Star]: Star is again referenced as part of the international general entertainment television channels under the Entertainment segment, reinforcing its strategic importance in Disney\u2019s international DTC offerings. The merger of Star+ into Disney+ aligns with the company\u2019s broader DTC strategy of unifying services under a single brand to simplify access and improve scalability."

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.\n\n## DTC PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS, KEY DEFINITIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nIn the U.S., Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or as part of various multi-product offerings. Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which was available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering. Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.\n\n## Paid Subscribers\n\nPaid subscribers reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Certain product offerings provide the option for an extra member to be added to an account (extra member add-on). These extra members are not counted as paid subscribers. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to multi-product offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each of the Company's services included in the multi-product offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ services. In Latin America prior to July 2024, if a subscriber had either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribed to Combo+, the subscriber was counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. Subscribers include those who receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements, including those for which the service is available to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.\n\n## International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)\n\nInternational Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\n## Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber\n\nHulu and ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses), premium and feature add-on revenue and extra member add-on revenue but excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN+ multiproduct offering. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.",

At Google, we hav e been bringing AI into our products and serv ices for more than a decade and making them av ailable to our users.\n\nIn 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for ev eryone with the introduction of Gemini, our nativ ely multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image, and v ideo. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and serv ices that are helping people ev eryday. T oday, all sev en of our two billion-user products - Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and YouTube - are using Gemini.\n\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at the forefront of innov ation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI dev elopment platform, world-class models, as well as assistiv e agents and applications.\n\nWe believe AI  has  the  potential  to  solv e  important  societal,  scientific,  and  engineering  challenges.  For  example,  in  2020,  Google  DeepMind's AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we introduced AlphaFold 3, built on the prev ious models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in life's processes.\n\nWe are focused on transforming our products to prov ide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we deliv er on our mission to organize the world's information and make it univ ersally accessible and useful.\n\n## Deliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\n\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized infrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\n\nWe are driv ing efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improv ements. For example, since we started serv ing AI Overv iews to our users, we hav e significantly lowered machine costs and latency through hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AIoptimized infrastructure allows us to use, and offer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built T ensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nOur teams across Alphabet lev erage Gemini, as well as other AI models we hav e prev iously dev eloped and announced, to deliv er the best product and serv ice experiences for our users, adv ertisers, partners, customers, and dev elopers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra,  which  explores  the  future  capabilities  of  a  univ ersal AI  assistant  and  Project  Mariner ,  an  early  prototype  capable  of  taking  actions  in Chrome as an experimental extension.\n\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means dev eloping AI in a way that maximizes the positiv e benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles.\n\n## Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\n\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to  driv e  transformation.  T hat  is  why  we  are  focused  on  making  it  easy  and  scalable  for  others  to  innov ate,  and  grow ,  with AI.  T hat  means  prov iding advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to Google's latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform giv es dev elopers the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generativ e AI models. Gemini for Google Cloud prov ides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist dev elopers to write, document, test, and operate software as well as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\n\n## Improve Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\n\nAs AI continues to improv e rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to prov ide our users the most helpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down concepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a v ideo and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps users understand complex information by summarizing sources and prov iding relev ant quotes. We are embedding the power of generativ e AI to continue helping our users express themselv es and get things done. For example, the Gemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write,  organize,  v isualize,  accelerate  workflows,  and  hav e  richer  meetings.

Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content.\n\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and dev ices. T hat is why we continue to inv est in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as our family of dev ices. We see tremendous potential for dev ices to be helpful and make people's liv es easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and serv ices that people rely on ev ery day is a journey that we are inv esting in for the long-term.\n\n## How We Make Money\n\nWe  have  built  world-class  adv ertising  technologies  for  adv ertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital  marketing  businesses.  Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across dev ices and formats, and we aim to ensure positiv e user experiences by serv ing the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our adv ertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help adv ertisers find untapped and incremental conv ersion opportunities.\n\nGoogle  Serv ices  generates  rev enues  primarily  by  deliv ering  both  performance  and  brand  adv ertising  that  appears  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other properties,  YouT ube,  and  Google  Network  partners'  properties  (\"Google  Network  properties\").  We  continue  to  inv est  in  both  performance  and  brand advertising and seek to improv e the measurability of adv ertising so adv ertisers understand the effectiv eness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and deliv ers relev ant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with adv ertisers. Performance advertising lets our adv ertisers connect with users while driv ing measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance adv ertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps  enhance  users'  awareness of  and  affinity  for  adv ertisers'  products  and  serv ices,  through  v ideos,  text,  images,  and other  interactiv e  ads  that  run  across  v arious  dev ices.  We  help  brand  adv ertisers  deliv er  digital  v ideos  and  other  types  of  ads  to  specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad adv ertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and adv ertisers in many ways, including filtering out inv alid traffic, remov ing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and v ideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nIn addition, Google Serv ices increasingly generates rev enues from products and serv ices beyond adv ertising, including:\n\n- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include rev enues from YouTube serv ices, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n- platforms , which primarily include rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\n- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of dev ices.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates rev enues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud serv ices. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:\n\n- AI-optimized Infrastructure: prov ides  open,  reliable,  and  scalable  compute,  networking, and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere - on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serv e various types of AI models.\n- Developer Platform: prov ides dev elopers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generativ e AI models. We offer widely used first-party, third-party, and open models along with serv ices such as v ector search, grounding, and distillation to further improv e the cost and quality of models.\n- Cybersecurity: prov ides  AI  powered  cybersecurity  solutions  to  help  customers  analyze,  detect,  protect,  and  respond  to  a  broad  range  of cybersecurity  threats,  to  further  strengthen  security  outcomes,  prioritize  which  threats  to  inv estigate,  and  identify  attack  paths,  as  well  as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.",

      "answer": "Google Network Partners play a significant role in both generating advertising revenues and absorbing a portion of those revenues through traffic acquisition costs (TAC). On page 59, it is stated that TAC includes amounts paid to Google Network partners for ads displayed on their properties, which directly links their involvement to advertising cost structures. Page 42 notes that advertising revenues are generated from Google Network properties, indicating that these partners contribute to revenue generation. However, page 31 forecasts that TAC paid to these partners will increase as advertising revenues grow, suggesting a proportional relationship between revenue and cost. This implies that while Google Network Partners help scale advertising revenues, they also represent a growing cash outflow, affecting net profitability and cash flow dynamics.",

We report rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app dev elopers and end users for which we earn a serv ice fee.\n\n## Google Cloud Revenues\n\nGoogle Cloud rev enues consist of rev enues from:\n\n- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  serv ices.  T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nOur cloud serv ices are generally prov ided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may hav e contract terms longer than a year.

Revenues related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably ov er the contract term as the customer receiv es and consumes the benefits of the cloud serv ices.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate rev enues to each performance obligation based on its relativ e standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receiv e cash-based incentiv es or credits, which are accounted for as v ariable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce rev enues. We believ e that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentiv es and credits.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues consists of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with 'Note about Forward-Looking Statements,' Part I, Item 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe following section generally discusses 2024 results compared to 2023 results.  Discussion of 2023 results compared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results\n\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Serv ices and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectiv ely as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\n\nThe following long-term trends hav e contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:\n\n- Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\n\nThe continuing ev olution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our rev enues since inception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our rev enues, although at a slower pace than we hav e experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and adv ertisers, including from other dev elopers and prov iders of AI products and serv ices, which may affect our rev enues.\n\n## \u00b7 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\n\nOur  users  are  accessing  our  products  and  serv ices  v ia  div erse  dev ices  and  modalities  beyond  traditional  desktop,  such  as  smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and serv ices to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\nWe benefit from adv ertising rev enues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer adv ertising formats. T he margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular dev ice type or modality matures, our adv ertising rev enues may be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in dev eloped countries, can affect our mobile adv ertising rev enues.\n\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our rev enues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising rev enues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in dev ice mix; geographic mix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relativ e rev enue growth rates of adv ertising rev enues from different channels; and rev enue share terms.\n\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our rev enues and put pressure on our margins.\n\n- As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization.\n\nAs interactions between users and adv ertisers change, and as online user behav ior ev olv es, for example with AI, we continue to expand our product offerings  to  serv e  these  changing  needs,  which  may  affect  monetization  of  our  products  and  serv ices.  We  expect  to  continue  to  incorporate  AI innov ations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When dev eloping new products and serv ices we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization.\n\n- As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\n\nThe shift to online, as well as the adv ent of the multi-dev ice world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India.  We continue to inv est heav ily and dev elop localized v ersions of our products and adv ertising programs relev ant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nAs of October 2, 2015, Alphabet Inc. became the successor issuer of Google Inc. pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act. Our Class A stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol 'GOOG' since August 19, 2004, and under the symbol \"GOOGL\" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no public market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol 'GOOG' since April 3, 2014.\n\n## Holders of Record\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 7,743 and 1,671 stockholders of record of our Class A stock and Class C stock, respectiv ely. Because many of our shares of Class A stock and Class C stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 57 stockholders of record of our Class B stock.\n\n## Dividend Program\n\nDiv idend payments to stockholders of Class A, Class B, and Class C shares were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion, respectiv ely, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company intends to pay quarterly cash div idends in the future, subject to rev iew and approv al by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion. We regularly ev aluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.\n\n## Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nThe  following  table  presents  information  with  respect  to  Alphabet's  repurchases  of  Class  A  and  Class  C  stock  during  the  quarter  ended December 31, 2024:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Alphabet's dividend policy for Class C shares align with the company's share repurchase activity and outstanding share count, and what does this reveal about the treatment and role of Class C shares in the company's capital structure?",
      "answer": "Alphabet paid $3.3 billion in dividends on Class C shares during 2024, indicating their material role in shareholder returns. At the same time, the company repurchased over 72 million Class C shares during the year, more than Class A shares, suggesting a strategic focus on managing Class C share levels. With 5,497 million Class C shares outstanding as of January 2025, these shares represent a significant portion of the capital structure. This reveals that while Class C shares are treated equally in terms of dividends, they are more actively managed through repurchases, potentially influencing ownership dynamics and signaling investor preference.",

The repurchase program does not hav e an expiration date.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash div idends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectiv ely.\n\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash div idends in the future, subject to rev iew and approv al by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\n\n## Note 12. Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using  the  weighted-av erage  number  of  shares  outstanding  during  the  period.  Diluted  net  income  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-av erage number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutiv e securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutiv e securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutiv e effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conv ersion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conv ersion of those shares.\n\nIn accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and div idend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to v oting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law , which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share div idends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law prov ides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would hav e the effect of adv ersely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a giv en class of stock must be approv ed by the class of stock adv ersely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation prov ides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder v ote, it must be approv ed by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors.",

      "answer": "Netflix faces significant intellectual property risks, including the potential for third-party infringement and costly legal disputes over content rights, which could lead to removal of content from its service or costly licensing agreements (page_11). Additionally, the company is heavily dependent on third-party content providers, and if studios or rights holders refuse to license content on acceptable terms, it could face increased programming costs and reduced content availability, directly affecting member retention and acquisition (page_10). Compounding these issues, Netflix's content amortization is based on estimated viewing patterns, which are subjective and could lead to changes in amortization timing if actual viewing differs from forecasts, impacting financial results (page_40). Together, these factors create a complex risk environment where legal exposure, rising licensing costs, and uncertain financial forecasting could undermine the long-term viability of Netflix's content strategy and compress operating margins.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "question": "How does Netflix's strategic reliance on content providers, as outlined in their intellectual property and risk disclosures, connect to their financial exposure through foreign currency remeasurement losses tied to content licensing obligations?",
      "answer": "Netflix's strategic reliance on content providers is evident in both their intellectual property and risk disclosures. On page 4, the company emphasizes that its ability to provide content depends on third-party licenses from studios and content providers, which are critical to maintaining a compelling content mix for members. On page 10, the risk section warns that if content providers refuse to license content on acceptable terms\u2014especially as they develop their own streaming services\u2014Netflix\u2019s service could be adversely affected, including rising programming costs and potential content removals. This dependency is further underscored financially on page 48, where Netflix reports a $293 million foreign currency remeasurement loss for 2023, primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies. This shows that Netflix\u2019s content licensing commitments not only carry operational and strategic risk but also direct financial exposure through currency fluctuations, linking their reliance on external content providers to tangible financial volatility.",

        "Hop 1: NFLX (page_4) \u2192 Content Providers: Netflix depends on third-party content providers for streaming content, with licensing terms and availability being critical to service continuity and member satisfaction.",
        "Hop 2: NFLX (page_10) \u2192 Content Providers: Risk is elevated as content providers increasingly launch their own platforms, potentially withdrawing content or increasing licensing costs, threatening Netflix's content mix and cost structure.",

      "answer": "Netflix's September 2023 increase in stock repurchase authorization by $10 billion, bringing the total to $15 billion, reflects confidence in its long-term financial position and strategic flexibility. Despite spending $6.045 billion on stock repurchases in 2023, the company still saw a $1.058 billion increase in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, indicating strong cash generation from operations. This aligns with Netflix's stated capital allocation strategy that balances repurchases with content investment and liquidity needs, while maintaining access to financing and preserving flexibility to adapt to market conditions.",

      "question": "How does Netflix's current Revolving Credit Agreement structure, including its interest terms and covenant restrictions, reflect its broader financial flexibility and strategic positioning as evidenced by both its borrowing inactivity and recent amendment history?",
      "answer": "Netflix's Revolving Credit Agreement provides for interest at either the Alternate Base Rate or Term SOFR Rate plus a margin of 0.75%, with a commitment fee of 0.10% on undrawn amounts, indicating a flexible but cost-conscious financing structure. Despite having access to this $1 billion facility, Netflix has not borrowed any amounts under the agreement as of December 31, 2023, suggesting strong internal liquidity or alternative funding sources. The agreement has been amended multiple times, most recently on March 6, 2023, to update interest rate benchmarks and extend maturity to June 17, 2026, reflecting proactive management of credit terms in response to market changes. These amendments, along with compliance with restrictive covenants that limit subsidiary debt, liens, and asset disposals, demonstrate Netflix's strategic approach to maintaining financial flexibility while managing risk. Together, the lack of borrowing activity, updated interest terms, and covenant discipline suggest a company positioning itself for financial agility without immediate liquidity pressure.",

      "question": "How does Comcast's regulatory exposure around retransmission consent agreements align with their revenue recognition practices and contractual distribution terms involving NBC and Telemundo networks?",
      "answer": "Comcast faces regulatory constraints under FCC rules requiring them to either carry local broadcast stations under 'must-carry' provisions or negotiate retransmission consent agreements, which often involve payments from cable operators to stations (page_16). These agreements, including those under NBC and Telemundo, directly contribute to the Media segment\u2019s revenue, where distribution revenue is recognized monthly based on subscriber counts and per-subscriber fees under multiyear agreements (page_75). The company also highlights that these distribution fees are a core component of its revenue model, with retransmission consent payments factored into multiyear contracts that generate predictable cash flow, particularly with half of annual Business Services Connectivity revenue tied to fixed pricing under existing contracts (page_10). This creates a regulatory-commercial tension: while retransmission consent agreements are a stable revenue source under long-term contracts, they are also subject to unpredictable regulatory outcomes that could alter future negotiations or terms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe, from time to time, participate in broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state levels and may also become subject to additional broadbandrelated commitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding. We cannot predict how and to whom any such funds will be awarded, when the initiatives will be terminated or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses.\n\nA number of municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create governmentowned networks, particularly in light of federal funding for broadband deployment. Certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of government-owned networks. Other states, however, have amended or may amend such laws to facilitate such networks. Much of the federal funding authorized for broadband deployment is conditioned on states agreeing to make it available for potential use by government-owned networks, although the funding prioritizes deployment to unserved and underserved areas and locations. We cannot predict how successful any of those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses.\n\n## Video and Media\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that apply to the cable services we provide through our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms business and to our cable networks and local broadcast television stations in our Media business. These laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete, particularly against DTC streaming service providers, which are not subject to these same requirements.\n\nFederal, state and local franchising rules and regulations may require us to provide adequate channel capacity, facilities and financial support for public, educational and governmental access programming; comply with certain renewal procedures for our franchise agreements; pay franchise fees; and comply with customer service, accessibility, and certain other requirements. In addition, the FCC and other federal agencies can impact the programming networks that we carry, as well as how we price, package, bill and market our video services. FCC regulations also require cable operators to carry programming transmitted by certain local broadcast television stations ('must-carry' requirement) or to negotiate a 'retransmission consent' agreement with certain other stations that will frequently involve payments from cable operators to the station; govern program access by preventing cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video providers; grant licenses to broadcast television stations for 8-year cycles, which may not be renewed on favorable terms, or at all; limit local and national television ownership, as well as foreign ownership in a broadcast television station; and regulate children's programming.\n\nThe FCC enforces these rules on a case-by-case basis based on complaints filed by consumers, state and local governments, and other entities. We have been involved in disputes at the FCC in some of these areas and may be involved in new disputes in the future, including potential disputes related to content moderation and free speech. We cannot predict the outcome of any such disputes or associated litigation. The FCC and Congress have previously considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with MVPDs and potentially with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. We currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis (in 'tiers') and, in various cases, individually. We have been involved in program access disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\n\nFurthermore, certain states and localities have adopted laws to impose franchise or other fees on DTC streaming services. To date, courts have invalidated those laws, but we cannot predict the outcome of any future litigation.\n\n## Wireless\n\nWe offer a wireless voice and data service primarily using our MVNO rights to provide the service over V erizon's wireless network. MVNOs are subject to many of the same FCC regulations as facilities-based wireless carriers, such as E911 services and local number portability, as well as certain state or local regulations. The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile broadband providers in the future, which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally.\n\n## Voice\n\nWe provide voice services using V oIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including  regulations  relating  to  privacy  of  customer  proprietary  network  information,  local  number  portability  duties  and  benefits,  disability  access,  E911,  law enforcement  assistance,  outage  reporting,  Universal  Service  Fund  contribution  obligations,  rural  call  completion,  customer  equipment  back-up  power,  robocall mitigation, service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level.\n\n13\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided over the contract period. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging  from 2  years  for  small  and  medium-sized  businesses  to  up  to 5  years  for  larger  enterprises.  Customers  with  contracts  may  only  discontinue  service  in accordance with the terms of their contracts. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual Business Services Connectivity segment revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers under contract typically pay on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\n## Media Segment\n\n## Advertising\n\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our linear television networks, Peacock and other digital properties.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days.  In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in contracts where the ratings were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMedia generates revenue from the distribution of television programming in the United States and internationally to traditional multichannel video providers, such as our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment, and to virtual multichannel video providers that offer streamed linear television networks. This revenue includes amounts under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements, and we also receive associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. We also receive monthly subscription fees for our Peacock service either directly from customers or from companies who sell Peacock to customers on our behalf. We have determined that we are principal in these arrangements and in the event we do not have transparency into the pricing charged by a company selling Peacock on our behalf, the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the fees receivable from that company pursuant to our arrangement.\n\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming on our television networks and a per subscriber fee, although revenue for certain of our television networks is based on a fix ed fee. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment within 60 days. These arrangements are accounted for as licenses of functional intellectual property and revenue is recognized as programming is provided.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\n## Content Licensing\n\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content to television networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers and other service providers. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film's theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\n\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing third-party agreements at any given time equals approximately one-half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this future revenue. The majority of this revenue will be recognized within 2 years. This amount may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\n\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does Comcast's financial exposure to Universal Beijing Resort, as reflected in its debt structure, compare with its operational stake and strategic positioning within the Theme Parks segment?",
      "answer": "Comcast's financial exposure to Universal Beijing Resort is primarily through $3.4 billion in debt as of December 31, 2024, which is reported separately under 'Debt Not Guaranteed' and consolidated on its balance sheet. As a 30% owner in a VIE (Variable Interest Entity), Comcast consolidates Universal Beijing Resort\u2019s $7.3 billion in assets and $7.0 billion in liabilities, indicating a significant but non-controlling operational stake. Strategically, Universal Beijing Resort is positioned as a core part of the Theme Parks segment, alongside Universal Orlando Resort, Universal Studios Hollywood, and Universal Studios Japan, with operations contributing to guest spending and brand expansion in China. This reflects a deliberate investment in global theme park presence despite the financial leverage and risk associated with its debt obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Nonmarketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  that  are  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  as  nonmarketable  equity  securities.  The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer.  We generally apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\n\n## Other Investments\n\nOther investments also includes certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, that are generally accounted for at amortized cost. We had no short-term instruments as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, these short-term instruments totaled $254 million. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs  that  use  interest  rates  for  instruments  with  similar  terms  and  remaining  maturities.  Proceeds  from  short-term  instruments  in  2024,  2023  and 2022  were $702 million, $560 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Purchases of short-term instruments in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $443 million, $506 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\n\n## Impairment Testing of Investments\n\nWe  review  our  investment  portfolio,  other  than  our  marketable  equity  securities,  each  reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  are  identified  events  or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\n\n## Consolidated Variable Interest Entity\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'), which opened in  September 2021.  We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2024, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of December 31, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort's results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statements of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.8 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.",

We also produce television content jointly as co-producers with third-party studios and production companies. Our television studios produce content primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Television\n- Universal Content Productions\n- Universal Television Alternative Studio\n- Universal International Studios\n- Sky Studios\n\nOur original content is primarily initially licensed to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, including those in our Media and Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segments. We also license content after its initial airing, license older television content from our television library, and distribute owned and acquired content globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products.  The production and distribution costs related to original broadcast television content generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial license, which means that obtaining additional licenses following the initial network license is critical to the content's financial success. Similar to our film studios, we typically owe residuals and participations payments in connection with television studio productions.\n\n## Theme Parks Segment\n\nOur Theme Parks segment primarily includes the operations of the following Universal theme parks:\n\n- Universal Orlando Resort : Includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, and our water park, V olcano Bay, all of which are located in Orlando, Florida. Universal Orlando Resort also includes Universal CityWalk Orlando, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and features onsite themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest, and will include an additional theme park, Epic Universe, that is expected to open in May 2025.\n- Universal Studios Hollywood : Includes the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park located in Hollywood, California and Universal CityWalk Hollywood, a dining, retail and entertainment complex.\n- Universal Studios Japan : Includes the Universal Studios Japan theme park located in Osaka, Japan.\n- Universal  Beijing  Resort :  Includes  the  Universal  Studios  Beijing  theme  park,  as  well  as  Universal  CityWalk  Beijing,  a  dining,  retail  and  entertainment complex, and on-site themed hotels, all of which are located in Beijing, China. Universal Beijing Resort is owned by us and a consortium of Chinese stateowned companies (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\nOur Theme Parks segment properties are primarily owned by us, although certain properties are leased, including land in Beijing, China and Osaka, Japan. We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in ex isting and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, as well as in new destinations and ex periences, such as Epic Universe; Universal Kids Resort, a smaller-scale theme park in Frisco, Texas expected to open in 2026; and Universal Horror Unleashed, a year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas, Nevada expected to open in 2025.\n\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks, including ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise, and from our consumer products business. Revenue for our theme parks generally depends on the overall environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on leisure and other recreational activities.\n\nWe also license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The themed elements in our rides, attractions, and merchandising are based on intellectual property in our Studios and Media segments and intellectual property licensed from third parties under long-term agreements.\n\n## Competition\n\n## Media\n\nOur  Media  segment  competes  for  viewers'  attention  and  audience  share  with  all  forms  of  programming  provided  to  viewers,  including  DTC  streaming  service providers; television networks; local broadcast television stations; physical and digital home entertainment products; video on demand and pay-per-view services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does Comcast's competitive positioning in broadcast television, particularly with respect to local broadcast television stations, align with its increasing programming cost pressures and its strategic pursuit of major sports rights like Sunday Night Football and the Olympics?",
      "answer": "Comcast faces increasing programming cost pressures, particularly from local broadcast television stations that demand higher payments for retransmission consent, which is a significant component of its rising per-subscriber programming expenses (page 23). At the same time, its broadcast networks compete with other major networks to secure affiliations with independently owned local broadcast television stations, which is essential for nationwide distribution (page 14). Additionally, Comcast has strategically invested in major sports rights, such as Sunday Night Football and the Olympics, which not only drive advertising and distribution revenue but also intensify its need to maintain strong relationships with local broadcast affiliates to maximize reach and monetization (page 12). This creates a complex dynamic where rising costs from local stations must be balanced against the strategic value of exclusive content and network affiliation agreements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe also create content for licensing to third parties and to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to license such content on acceptable terms or at all could negatively impact our business. Moreover, we may generate lower revenue when we opt to retain our content for our own use, including for Peacock, rather than licensing it to third parties who pay licensing fees for such content.\n\nIf  our  content  does  not  achieve  sufficient  consumer  acceptance,  or  if  we  cannot  obtain  or  retain  rights  to  popular  content  on  acceptable  terms,  or  at  all,  our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect our video businesses.\n\nWe expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms business and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. Part of these programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by consolidation in the media industry, which may further  increase  our  programming  ex penses.  If  we  are  unable  to  offset  programming  cost  increases  through  rate  increases,  the  sale  of  additional  services,  cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## The loss of programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nOur linear television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to our television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers as the media distribution business model changes. Similarly, multichannel video providers may elect not to enter into agreements to distribute some or all of our linear television networks as a result of these changing market dynamics. In addition, our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. Our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either 'must-carry' status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without paying any compensation to us, or 'retransmission consent,' in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider.\n\nFor all of these types of arrangements, our ability to renew agreements on acceptable terms may be affected by evolving market dynamics and industry consolidation. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on similar terms. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our businesses.\n\n## Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others.\n\nWe rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain, or continue to obtain, licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, or at all, our businesses could be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMedia competes for the sale of advertising with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers and other online content, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content, as well as with other television networks and stations, and all other advertising platforms. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations or digital properties. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number and forms of entertainment choices available. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur domestic cable networks and international networks compete primarily with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming service providers. Our domestic broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations  with  independently owned local broadcast television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience. Peacock competes for subscribers primarily with other DTC streaming service providers, as well as with traditional providers of linear television programming.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of our studios primarily depends on the number of films and television series and episodes produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Our studios also compete to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on television networks, and on DTC streaming services.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nOur theme parks compete with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, tourism, recreational activities and lodging. The competitive position of our theme parks primarily depends on the quality and popularity of rides and attractions, including effective use of intellectual property in themed  attractions.  There  is  increased  competition  in  areas  with  high  concentrations  of  theme  parks  and  other  attractions  operated  by  several  companies. Macroeconomic conditions and other factors may also result in shifting consumer preferences toward other types of destinations, experiences and products.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nRevenue and costs and expenses in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic G ames and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic G ames. Costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the recognition of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Media is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Domestic advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the winter holiday season, and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively.  International  advertising  revenue typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months, with lower levels in summer months due to the timing of European football seasons, winter holidays and summer vacations. Revenue also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year.\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, through DTC streaming services and viewing on demand, and on physical and digital home entertainment products. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the winter holiday season. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film's ex hibition in movie theaters. Content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees. Revenue from our television studios fluctuates in part due to a correlation with the broadcast network season beginning annually in September.\n\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the winter holiday season.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The agreement expires after the 2033-34 season, w ith a termination right available to the NFL after the 2029-30 season. The agreement also includes rights to additional exclusive games on Peacock. All of the NFL games are also distributed in the S panish language on Universo or Telemundo.\n\n(c) Includes the unilateral right by the other party (i.e., the licensor) to the agreement, under certain circumstances, to shorten the term of the agreement by one year.\n\nOur  television  and  streaming  business  competes  for  the  acquisition  of  content,  including  sports  rights,  and  for  on-air  and  creative  talent  primarily  with  other television networks,  DTC streaming providers, and local broadcast television stations.  In  Europe, major sports rights, which are significant to our international networks, are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a 3 to 5 year period.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\nOur Studios segment primarily includes our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations. Our studio production facilities primarily include our owned Universal City location in Los Angeles, California and our leased studios in Atlanta, G eorgia and in Elstree, United Kingdom. Revenue is generated primarily from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content and from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. We also generate revenue from the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products, as well as the production and licensing of live stage plays and the distribution of content produced by third parties.\n\n## Film Studios\n\nOur film studios develop, produce, acquire, market and distribute filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Pictures\n- Illumination\n- DreamWorks Animation\n- Focus Features\n- Working Title\n\nWe distribute the majority of our films initially for ex hibition in movie theaters, while other films are initially distributed through licensing agreements. After their initial release, we distribute films globally to different customers over multiple licensing windows. We license films, including recent films and selections from our film library, which is comprised of more than 6,500 movies in a variety of genres, to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, and to video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers. This includes licenses to our Media and Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segments. Certain films are also licensed to our Media segment and made available for viewing on Peacock on the same date as the theatrical release. We also distribute films globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products. Additionally, we acquire distribution rights to films produced by third parties, which may be limited to particular geographic regions, specific forms of media or certain periods of time. Theatrical revenue is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, their acceptance by audiences, the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sales retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is generally a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding licensing windows and through physical and digital home entertainment product sales.\n\nWe develop and produce films both alone and jointly with other studios or production companies. In certain cases, we have also entered into film co-financing arrangements with third party studios and non-studio entities to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film.\n\nIn connection with film studio productions, we typically owe 'residuals' payments to individuals hired under collective bargaining agreements, which are generally calculated based on post-theatrical or content licensing revenue.  We also typically owe 'participations' payments to creative talent, to third parties under cofinancing agreements and to other parties involved in content production, which are generally based on the financial performance of the content.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "Comcast's investment in Epic Universe is reflected across its capital expenditures outlook, strategic theme park expansion plans, and integrated business expectations. In 2025, the company plans to continue investing in existing and new attractions at Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe, as part of its broader capital allocation strategy (page 51). The park is expected to open in May 2025, marking a key milestone in the company's theme park expansion and a new destination within its Theme Parks segment (page 13). Additionally, the investment aligns with Comcast\u2019s broader Content & Experiences business, where Epic Universe is expected to positively impact attendance and guest spending, reinforcing the company\u2019s integrated approach between its theme parks and media content distribution (page 42). This multi-faceted approach demonstrates how Epic Universe supports both near-term capital deployment and long-term experiential growth.",

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet  cash  used  in  financing  activities  decreased  in  2024  primarily  due  to  repayment  of  a  collateralized  obligation  in  the  prior  year  (see  Note  7),  a  decrease  in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, lower repurchases and repayments of debt in the current year, repayments of short-term borrowings, net in the prior year and higher proceeds from borrowings in the current year.\n\nIn September 2024, we issued \u20ac1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing in 2032 and 2036 and entered into a corresponding cross-currency swap, effectively converting the debt to an aggregate U.S. dollar principal amount of $2.0 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.72%. We also issued \u00a3750 million ($1.0 billion using ex change rates on the date of issuance) principal amount of fix ed rate sterling senior notes maturing in 2040 with an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from this issuance were intended for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the early redemption of $725 million of  our  outstanding  5.25%  Notes  due  2025,  which  was  completed  in  October  2024,  and  the  repayment  of  certain  of  our  other  outstanding  debt  with  near-term maturities. In May 2024, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes, which have maturities ranging between 2029 and 2054 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38%. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for the repayment of our outstanding commercial paper, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nIn 2024, we made debt repayments of $3.6 billion, including $1.9 billion principal amount of notes due at maturity and $750 million of 5.250% Notes due 2025, $391 million of 3.950% Notes due 2025, $256 million of 3.375% Notes due 2025, and $104 million of 3.150% Notes due 2026.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In January 2024, our Board of Directors terminated our existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion effective as of January 26, 2024, which had no expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased a total of 212 million shares of our Class A common stock for $8.6 billion under our authorization programs. We did not purchase any shares outside of these programs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $7.0 billion remaining under the authorization, and in January 2025, our Board of Directors terminated the existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion, which has no expiration date. We expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.\n\nIn 2024, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.31 per share, including our fourth quarter dividend payable in January 2025 and we made dividend payments of $4.8 billion. In January 2025, our Board of Directors approved a 6.5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.33 per share, to be paid in April 2025. We ex pect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

We also produce television content jointly as co-producers with third-party studios and production companies. Our television studios produce content primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Television\n- Universal Content Productions\n- Universal Television Alternative Studio\n- Universal International Studios\n- Sky Studios\n\nOur original content is primarily initially licensed to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, including those in our Media and Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segments. We also license content after its initial airing, license older television content from our television library, and distribute owned and acquired content globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products.  The production and distribution costs related to original broadcast television content generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial license, which means that obtaining additional licenses following the initial network license is critical to the content's financial success. Similar to our film studios, we typically owe residuals and participations payments in connection with television studio productions.\n\n## Theme Parks Segment\n\nOur Theme Parks segment primarily includes the operations of the following Universal theme parks:\n\n- Universal Orlando Resort : Includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, and our water park, V olcano Bay, all of which are located in Orlando, Florida. Universal Orlando Resort also includes Universal CityWalk Orlando, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and features onsite themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest, and will include an additional theme park, Epic Universe, that is expected to open in May 2025.\n- Universal Studios Hollywood : Includes the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park located in Hollywood, California and Universal CityWalk Hollywood, a dining, retail and entertainment complex.\n- Universal Studios Japan : Includes the Universal Studios Japan theme park located in Osaka, Japan.\n- Universal  Beijing  Resort :  Includes  the  Universal  Studios  Beijing  theme  park,  as  well  as  Universal  CityWalk  Beijing,  a  dining,  retail  and  entertainment complex, and on-site themed hotels, all of which are located in Beijing, China. Universal Beijing Resort is owned by us and a consortium of Chinese stateowned companies (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\nOur Theme Parks segment properties are primarily owned by us, although certain properties are leased, including land in Beijing, China and Osaka, Japan. We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in ex isting and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, as well as in new destinations and ex periences, such as Epic Universe; Universal Kids Resort, a smaller-scale theme park in Frisco, Texas expected to open in 2026; and Universal Horror Unleashed, a year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas, Nevada expected to open in 2025.\n\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks, including ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise, and from our consumer products business. Revenue for our theme parks generally depends on the overall environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on leisure and other recreational activities.\n\nWe also license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The themed elements in our rides, attractions, and merchandising are based on intellectual property in our Studios and Media segments and intellectual property licensed from third parties under long-term agreements.\n\n## Competition\n\n## Media\n\nOur  Media  segment  competes  for  viewers'  attention  and  audience  share  with  all  forms  of  programming  provided  to  viewers,  including  DTC  streaming  service providers; television networks; local broadcast television stations; physical and digital home entertainment products; video on demand and pay-per-view services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear television networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to content and marketing at Peacock. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics in the third quarter of 2024 and our acquisition of NBA rights, which begin in 2025.\n\nOur Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content &amp; Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. The Writers G uild and the SAG  work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively, resulted in reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment and reduced programming and production costs at both our Studios and Media segments in 2023.\n\nWe continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we expect will open in May 2025, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does Disney's treatment of Asia Theme Parks borrowings in terms of interest cost, maturity structure, and financing activity collectively reflect the company's broader debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "Disney's Asia Theme Parks borrowings totaled $1,425 million in fiscal 2022, with an effective interest rate of 6.11%, significantly higher than the overall corporate average of 4.08%. These borrowings are primarily long-term with no maturities in the near term (2023\u20132024), contrasting with the broader debt portfolio that includes near-term maturities. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, there was a net increase of $105 million in Asia Theme Parks borrowings after repayments and other adjustments, indicating active financing support for the segment. This suggests that Disney is strategically managing its debt by isolating higher-cost, long-duration financing to its international theme park operations while maintaining flexibility in its core borrowing structure.",

COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 18).\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\n## Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution\n\nDMED encompasses the Company's global film and episodic television content production and distribution activities.

      "question": "How does Disney's decision to continue investing in new cruise ships align with its risk disclosures about economic downturns reducing demand for high-cost discretionary experiences like those described in its broader consumer-facing businesses?",
      "answer": "Disney's investment in cruise ships, noted on page 17 as part of its Parks & Experiences segment capital expenditures, reflects a strategic commitment to expanding its premium travel offerings. However, this strategy must be balanced against the economic risk factors outlined on page 24, which highlight that declines in economic conditions can reduce attendance at parks and resorts, and more generally shift consumer demand away from discretionary entertainment spending. Page 25 further emphasizes that investments in cruise ships and other consumer-facing facilities are made with uncertain market conditions in mind, and if consumer preferences or economic conditions shift post-investment, these assets may not generate anticipated returns. Therefore, while Disney sees cruise ships as a growth avenue, the disclosures suggest that macroeconomic volatility and post-pandemic shifts in consumer behavior pose material risks to the success of these capital-intensive ventures.",

The current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products or subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC products, while also increasing the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation in the domestic and global energy sector and other pronounced price increases generally and in certain other sectors, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. A decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our business plans, such as our plans to realign our cost structure and for the new DTC ad-supported service, pricing structure and price increases. In addition, actions to reduce inflation, including raising interest rates, increase our cost of borrowing, which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms. Further, global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar has adversely impacted the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar may increase our labor, supply or other costs in non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries. Broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution may further exacerbate current inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations. The adverse impact on our businesses of the decline in economic conditions will depend, in part, on its severity and duration and our ability to mitigate the impacts of this decline on our businesses will be limited.\n\n## Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.\n\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In addition, theater-going to watch movies currently is, and may continue to be, below pre-COVID-19 levels. Declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, initiating plans to again reorganize our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies, and developing next generation storytelling offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, next generation storytelling offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. We expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources, particularly as we expand our DTC offerings. To date we have experienced significant losses in our DTC businesses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models.\n\n## Misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for public or out-of-home",

Demand for certain of our out-of-home entertainment experiences, such as theater-going to watch movies, has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, and COVID-19 may continue to impact consumer tastes and preferences. In addition, many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S. The success of our businesses therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in content production and acquisition, acquisition of sports rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other facilities or customer facing platforms before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance, and these products may be introduced into a significantly different market or economic or social climate from the one we anticipated at the time of the investment decisions. If our entertainment offerings and products (including our content offerings, which have been impacted by COVID-19 and may in the future be impacted by COVID-19 developments or other health outbreaks or pandemics) as well as our methods to make our offerings and products available to consumers, do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue may decline, decline further or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby further adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. Further, consumers' perceptions of our position on matters of public interest, including our efforts to achieve certain of our environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. Consumer tastes and preferences impact, among other items, revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air), affiliate fees, subscription fees, theatrical film receipts, the license of rights to other distributors, theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, sales of licensed consumer products or sales of our other consumer products and services.\n\n## The success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create.\n\nThe value to us of our IP is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our IP may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. The terms of some copyrights for IP related to some of our products and services have expired and other copyrights will expire in the future. For example, in the United States and countries that look to the United States copyright term when shorter than their own, the copyright term for early works such as the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), and the specific early versions of characters depicted in those works, expires at the end of the 95th calendar year after the date the copyright was originally secured in the United States. Revenues generated from this intellectual property could be negatively impacted.\n\nThe unauthorized use of our IP may increase the cost of protecting rights in our IP or reduce our revenues. The convergence of computing, communication and entertainment devices, increased broadband internet speed and penetration, increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of IP rights more challenging. The unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for IP rights holders. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry IP in one country can adversely affect the results of the Company's operations worldwide, despite the Company's efforts to protect its IP rights. COVID-19 and distribution innovation in response to COVID-19 has increased opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways. Additionally, negative economic conditions coupled with a shift in government priorities could lead to less enforcement. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our IP against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content and other commercial misuses of our IP.\n\nWith respect to IP developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in IP may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from or utilize the IP that is the subject of challenged rights. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain IP rights of third parties. Technological changes in industries in which the Company operates and extensive patent coverage in those areas may increase the risk of such claims being brought and prevailing.\n\n## Protection of electronically stored data and other cybersecurity is costly, and if our data or systems are materially compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities, damage to our reputation, disruption of service or theft of our assets.\n\nWe maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. We also use computer systems to deliver our products and services and operate our businesses. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access, modification, exfiltration, destruction or denial of access and our computer systems are subject to cyberattacks that may result in disruptions in service.

      "question": "How does Disney's strategic positioning of its 30% stake in Tata Play Limited align with its broader international media distribution strategy and financial reporting of equity investments, particularly in light of the stake's placement within DMED's content licensing structure and its valuation in the equity method investments section?",
      "answer": "Disney's 30% stake in Tata Play Limited is positioned within the DMED segment as part of its content licensing and post-production services, aligning with Disney's broader international media distribution strategy by leveraging Tata Play's direct-to-home satellite platform in India. This strategic alignment is complemented by the financial reporting in the equity method investments section, where Tata Play is listed among key media investments like A+E and CTV Specialty Television, with an aggregate book value exceeding underlying net assets by $0.8 billion as of October 1, 2022. The stake is also referenced in the DMED section as part of Disney\u2019s international content delivery infrastructure, suggesting that the investment supports Disney\u2019s global content monetization efforts, particularly in high-growth markets like India.",

This integration is further reflected in the receivables presentation, where captive reinsurance arrangements are specifically excluded from reported receivables, signaling a distinct treatment in financial reporting and asset management.

      "question": "Given that Verizon's Intelligent Edge Network strategy emphasizes 5G deployment, how does its continued reliance on 4G LTE for FWA broadband impact its Consumer segment operating income margin and Segment EBITDA metrics?",
      "answer": "Verizon's Intelligent Edge Network strategy focuses on transforming its architecture to support 5G, which promises higher throughput and lower latency than 4G LTE. Despite this strategic shift, the company continues to rely on 4G LTE for Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) broadband, particularly through offerings like LTE Home Internet. As of December 31, 2023, the 4G LTE network covers approximately 330 million people, making it a foundational component of FWA services. This reliance on 4G LTE for FWA directly affects the Consumer segment's financial metrics, where Segment EBITDA and operating income margin are key indicators of performance. Since 4G LTE still carries about half of the wireless traffic and supports a significant portion of FWA broadband, the ongoing operational and maintenance costs for this legacy network likely influence the segment's profitability. While 5G deployment is expected to drive future growth, the current dependence on 4G LTE infrastructure may constrain improvements in operating income margin and Segment EBITDA in the near term.",

        "Hop 1: [VZ](page_29) \u2192 [4G LTE Network]: The Consumer segment's financial metrics, including Segment EBITDA and operating income margin, are key indicators of performance and are influenced by network-related costs.",
        "Hop 2: [VZ](page_7) \u2192 [4G LTE Network]: The 4G LTE network remains critical for FWA broadband services and covers approximately 330 million people as of December 31, 2023, despite strategic investments in 5G and network densification.",
        "Hop 3: [VZ](page_58) \u2192 [4G LTE Network]: The Consumer segment provides FWA broadband using both 5G and 4G LTE networks, indicating continued reliance on 4G LTE for delivering services to customers not served by Fios."

      "answer": "Verizon's Business segment explicitly lists 'corporate networking solutions' as a core product offering, targeting businesses, government customers, and carriers globally. This aligns with the segment's revenue of $30.1 billion in 2023, despite a 3.1% year-over-year decline, indicating the importance of these solutions in maintaining a significant portion of the segment's performance. Furthermore, within the Enterprise and Public Sector vertical\u2014representing 50% of Business revenues\u2014Verizon emphasizes private networking, cloud connectivity, and software-defined networking services, which are key components of its corporate networking solutions. This strategic focus supports large businesses and government entities in optimizing operations and managing risks, reinforcing the centrality of corporate networking solutions in Verizon\u2019s enterprise value proposition.",

      "answer": "AT&T's decision to retain its 41.3% stake in SKY Mexico while divesting its Latin American video operations through the sale of Vrio reflects a strategic choice to maintain exposure to the Mexican pay-TV market without full operational control. This aligns with the broader divestiture strategy seen in the sale of Vrio for $610 in note receivables, which included a significant impairment charge of $4,555 related to Latin American operations, including $2,500 in property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets. Despite this impairment, AT&T continues to account for SKY Mexico under the equity method, consistent with its treatment of other significant investments like DIRECTV, where it also holds a junior preferred position. The equity method allows AT&T to reflect its share of SKY Mexico\u2019s earnings without consolidating its financials, which supports a capital-light strategy while maintaining a strategic foothold in the region.",

In the second quarter of 2021, we classified the Vrio disposal group as held-for-sale and reported the disposal group at fair value less cost to sell, which resulted in a noncash, pre-tax impairment charge of $4,555, including approximately $2,100 related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments and $2,500 related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Approximately $80 of the impairment was attributable to noncontrolling interest. The assets and liabilities removed from our consolidated balance sheet included $851 of Vrio held-for-sale assets primarily related to deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs, prepaids and other deferred charges, and $2,872 of related liabilities primarily for reserves associated with accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, which reversed against accumulated other comprehensive income upon close of the transaction. This disposition did not result in a net material gain or loss. We continue to hold a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nOtter Media During the third quarter of 2021, we disposed of substantially all of the assets of Otter Media. We received approximately $1,540 in cash and removed approximately $1,200 of goodwill associated with these assets. The dispositions did not result in a material gain or loss.\n\nPlaydemic Ltd. On September 20, 2021, we sold WarnerMedia's mobile games app studio, Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic) for approximately $1,370 in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain of $706 in 'Other income (expense) - net,' on our consolidated statement of income. Approximately $600 of goodwill was removed related to this business. Playdemic was excluded from the pending WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction.\n\nCentral European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CME) On October 13, 2020, we completed the sale of our 65.3% interest in CME, a European broadcasting company, for approximately $1,100. This disposition did not result in a material gain or loss. Upon close, we received relief from a debt guarantee originally covering approximately $1,100 that was reduced to $600 at the time of the sale.\n\nOperations in Puerto Rico On October 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our previously held-for-sale wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for approximately $1,950 and recorded a pre-tax loss of $82. Upon sale we removed held-for-sale assets ('Prepaid and other current assets') and held-for-sale liabilities ('Accounts payable and accrued liabilities') that primarily consisted of FCC licenses (approximately $1,100), allocated goodwill (approximately $250), net property, plant and equipment (approximately $850) and net tax liabilities (approximately $500), previously reported on our consolidated balance sheets. The proceeds were used to redeem $1,950 of cumulative preferred interests in a subsidiary that held notes secured by the proceeds of this sale.\n\nHudson Yards In June 2019, we sold our ownership in Hudson Yards North Tower Holdings LLC under a sale-leaseback arrangement for cash proceeds of $2,081 and recorded a loss of approximately $100 resulting from transaction costs (primarily real estate transfer taxes).",

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nInvestments in partnerships, joint ventures and less than majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). The transaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Video Business, with DIRECTV being accounted for under the equity method beginning August 1, 2021.\n\nIn May 2020, we acquired the remaining interest in HBO LAG and fully consolidated that entity. In October 2020, we sold our ownership interest in CME. (See Note 6)\n\nIn 2019, we sold our investments in Hudson Yards and Hulu. (See Note 6)\n\nOur investments in equity affiliates at December 31, 2021 primarily included our interests in DIRECTV, SKY Mexico and The CW Network.\n\nDIRECTV We account for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting. DIRECTV is considered a variable interest entity for accounting purposes. As DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&amp;T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO, we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of DIRECTV.\n\nThe ownership interests in DIRECTV, based on seniority are as follows:\n\n- Preferred units with distribution rights of $1,800 held by TPG, which were fully distributed by December 31, 2021.\n- Junior preferred units with distribution rights of $4,250 held by AT&amp;T, of which $3,212 of distribution rights remain as of December 31, 2021.\n- Distribution preference associated with Common units of $4,200 held by AT&amp;T.\n- Common units, with 70% held by AT&amp;T and 30% held by TPG.\n\nThe initial fair value of the equity considerations on July 31, 2021 was $6,852, which was determined using a discounted cash flow model reflecting distribution rights and preference of the individual instruments. During 2021, we recognized $619 of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $1,942 from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV at December 31, 2021 was $5,539.\n\nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive non-proportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests.\n\nSKY Mexico We hold a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, which is a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe CW Network (The CW) We hold a 50.0% interest in The CW, which is an advertising supported broadcasting and licensing joint venture between Warner Bros. and CBS Corporation.",

The main contracts included the following:\n\n- A contract covering approximately 12,000 Mobility employees in 36 states and the District of Columbia is set to expire in February 2022.\n- A contract covering approximately 6,000 wireline employees in five Midwest states that was set to expire in April 2022 was extended for a four-year period until April 2026.\n- A contract covering approximately 3,000 MW IBEW employees is set to expire in June 2022.\n- A contract covering approximately 2,000 AT&amp;T Corp. employees nationwide that was set to expire in April 2022 was extended for a four-year period until April 2026.\n- A contract covering approximately 170 Teamsters Alascom employees in Alaska is set to expire in February 2022.\n\nEnvironmental We are subject from time to time to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under federal, state or local environmental laws. We reference in our Forms 10-Q and 10-K certain environmental proceedings that could result in monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) of three hundred thousand dollars or more.

      "answer": "AT&T's deconsolidation of DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC was driven by the strategic decision to exit the U.S. Video business by forming a joint venture with TPG, in which AT&T contributed its U.S. Video operations in exchange for $4,250 million in junior preferred units and a 70% economic interest in common units. This transaction was structured such that DIRECTV became a variable interest entity, and AT&T concluded it was not the primary beneficiary, leading to deconsolidation and a shift to equity method accounting. The initial fair value of AT&T\u2019s investment in DIRECTV was $6,852 million, determined through a discounted cash flow model that reflected distribution rights and preferences. This valuation and accounting treatment marked a significant financial event that removed the Video segment\u2019s operations from AT&T\u2019s consolidated financial statements, aligning with management\u2019s strategic shift and impacting how AT&T reports future earnings and cash flows from this investment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&amp;T Inc. is referred to as 'AT&amp;T,' 'we' or the 'Company.' The consolidated financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  which  we  control. AT&amp;T  is  a  holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications, media and technology industries.\n\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction, we separated and deconsolidated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method (see Notes 6 and 10). On November 15, 2021, we sold our Latin America video operations, Vrio, to Grupo Werthein (see Note 6).\n\nAll significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in subsidiaries and partnerships which we do not control but have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included in our results on a one quarter lag. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees' other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including translation adjustments. We treat distributions received from equity method investees as returns on investment and classify them as cash flows from operating activities until those distributions exceed our cumulative equity in the earnings of that investment. We treat the excess amount as a return of investment and classify it as cash flows from investing activities.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, including other estimates of probable losses and expenses, that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior-period amounts have been conformed to the current period's presentation.\n\n## Accounting Policies and Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nCredit Losses As of January 1, 2020, we adopted, through modified retrospective application, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, 'Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,' or Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326 (ASC 326), which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under prior GAAP with an expected credit loss model. ASC 326 affects trade receivables, loans, contract assets, certain beneficial interests, off-balance-sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance and other financial assets that are not subject to fair value through net income, as defined by the standard. Under the expected credit loss model, we are required to consider future economic trends to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Upon adoption on January 1, 2020, we recorded a $293 reduction to 'Retained earnings,' $395 increase to 'Allowances for credit losses' applicable to our trade and loan receivables, $10 reduction of contract assets, $105 reduction of net deferred income tax liability and $7 reduction of 'Noncontrolling interest.' Our adoption of ASC 326 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\nLeases As of January 1, 2019, we adopted, with modified retrospective application, the FASB's ASU No. 2016-02, 'Leases (Topic 842)' (ASC 842), which replaces existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements (see Note 8). ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding 'right-of-use' assets. For income statement recognition purposes, leases are classified as either a finance or an operating lease without relying upon bright-line tests.\n\nThe key change upon adoption of the standard was balance sheet recognition of operating leases, given that the recognition of lease expense on our income statement is similar to our historical accounting. Using the modified retrospective transition method of adoption, we did not adjust the balance sheet for comparative periods but recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2019. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allowed us to carry forward our historical lease classification. We also elected the practical expedient related to land easements, allowing us to carry forward our accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements that were not accounted for as leases. We excluded leases with original terms of one year or less. Additionally, we elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets. Our accounting for finance leases did not change from our prior accounting for capital leases.",

In connection with the transaction, the Company contributed its U.S. Video business unit to DIRECTV for $4,250 million of junior preferred units, an additional distribution preference of $4,200 million and a 70% economic interest in common units. DIRECTV was considered a variable interest entity for accounting purposes. The Company concluded that it was not the primary beneficiary and accordingly deconsolidated DIRECTV and accounted for its investment under the equity method of accounting. The initial fair value of the Company's investment in DIRECTV on July 31, 2021 was $6,852 million, which was determined using a discounted cash flow model, reflecting distribution rights and preference of the individual instruments.\n\nAuditing management's application of the variable interest entity consolidation model to this transaction, and its initial estimate of the fair value of the Company's investment in DIRECTV, required significant judgment. In particular, management's assessment of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary under the variable interest model required significant judgment to determine the activities of the investee that most significantly impact the investee's economics, and management applied significant judgment in determining and applying the valuation model used to estimate the initial fair value of the Company's investment in DIRECTV.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's application of the variable interest entity consolidation model, including the identification of the activities that most significantly impact DIRECTV's economics, and its selection and application of the model used to estimate the initial fair value of the Company's investment in DIRECTV.\n\nOur audit procedures to test the appropriateness of management's application of the variable interest entity consolidation model to the DIRECTV transaction included, among others, evaluating the design and purpose of the variable interest entity, and assessing the terms of the arrangement, that were relevant to the evaluation of DIRECTV's significant activities. Our procedures to test the valuation of AT&amp;T's investment in DIRECTV included, among others, involving our valuation specialists in assessing the reasonableness of the selected valuation methodology, performing an independent calculation, and performing sensitivity analysis for certain assumptions in the model.\n\n## /s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1999.\n\nDallas, Texas February 16, 2022",

It is included in the segment operating results following the date of acquisition.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery Inc. On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft). (See Note 6)\n\nOperating revenues increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increases in content and other, reflecting the partial recovery from prior-year impacts of the pandemic, and also in subscription revenues. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower content and advertising revenues, which were negatively impacted by the pandemic, partially offset by higher subscription revenues.\n\nSubscription revenues increased in 2021 and 2020, reflecting growth of DTC domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and the May 2020 acquisition of the remaining interest in HBO Latin America Group. DTC subscription revenues were $7,723 in 2021, versus $6,090 and $5,814 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and include growth from intercompany relationships with the Communications segment.",

      "question": "What was the financial impact of AT&T's acquisition of the remaining interest in HBO LAG in May 2020, and how does this transaction compare in scale and strategic significance to AT&T's other equity method investment activities and spectrum acquisitions during the same reporting period?",
      "answer": "AT&T acquired the remaining interest in HBO LAG for $141 in May 2020, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $68 due to the fair value of the business exceeding the carrying amount of the prior equity method investment. This transaction was relatively small in scale compared to AT&T's broader investment activities, such as the $6,852 receipt of equity interest in DIRECTV in 2021 and the multi-billion-dollar spectrum acquisitions, including $23,406 for C-Band licenses in early 2021. While the HBO LAG acquisition allowed AT&T to fully consolidate the business and record $640 in trade names, $271 in distribution networks, and $346 in goodwill under the WarnerMedia segment, it was a minor transaction in the context of AT&T's overall capital allocation strategy, which prioritized spectrum investments and strategic restructuring of its video business through the DIRECTV joint venture.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 10. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nInvestments in partnerships, joint ventures and less than majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). The transaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Video Business, with DIRECTV being accounted for under the equity method beginning August 1, 2021.\n\nIn May 2020, we acquired the remaining interest in HBO LAG and fully consolidated that entity. In October 2020, we sold our ownership interest in CME. (See Note 6)\n\nIn 2019, we sold our investments in Hudson Yards and Hulu. (See Note 6)\n\nOur investments in equity affiliates at December 31, 2021 primarily included our interests in DIRECTV, SKY Mexico and The CW Network.\n\nDIRECTV We account for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting. DIRECTV is considered a variable interest entity for accounting purposes. As DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&amp;T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO, we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of DIRECTV.\n\nThe ownership interests in DIRECTV, based on seniority are as follows:\n\n- Preferred units with distribution rights of $1,800 held by TPG, which were fully distributed by December 31, 2021.\n- Junior preferred units with distribution rights of $4,250 held by AT&amp;T, of which $3,212 of distribution rights remain as of December 31, 2021.\n- Distribution preference associated with Common units of $4,200 held by AT&amp;T.\n- Common units, with 70% held by AT&amp;T and 30% held by TPG.\n\nThe initial fair value of the equity considerations on July 31, 2021 was $6,852, which was determined using a discounted cash flow model reflecting distribution rights and preference of the individual instruments. During 2021, we recognized $619 of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $1,942 from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV at December 31, 2021 was $5,539.\n\nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive non-proportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests.\n\nSKY Mexico We hold a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, which is a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe CW Network (The CW) We hold a 50.0% interest in The CW, which is an advertising supported broadcasting and licensing joint venture between Warner Bros. and CBS Corporation.",

ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nSpectrum Auctions On February 24, 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that AT&amp;T was the winning bidder for 1,621 C-Band licenses, comprised of a total of 80 MHz nationwide, including 40 MHz in Phase I. We provided to the FCC an upfront deposit of $550 in 2020 and cash payments totaling $22,856 in the first quarter of 2021, for a total of $23,406. We received the licenses in July 2021 and classified the auction deposits, related capitalized interest and billed relocation costs as 'Licenses - Net' on our December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet. In December 2021, we paid $955 of Incentive Payments upon clearing of Phase I spectrum and estimate that we will pay $2,112 upon clearing of Phase II spectrum, expected by the end of 2023. Additionally, we are responsible for approximately $1,000 of compensable relocation costs over the next several years as the spectrum is being cleared by satellite operators, of which $650 was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in 'Acquisitions, net of cash acquired' on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest is capitalized until the spectrum is ready for its intended use. Funding for the purchase price of the spectrum included a combination of cash on hand and short-term investments, as well as short- and long-term debt.\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder for 1,624 3.45 GHz licenses in Auction 110. We provided the FCC an upfront deposit of $123 in the third quarter of 2021 and will pay the remaining $8,956 in the first quarter of 2022, for a total of $9,079. We intend to fund the purchase price using cash and short-term investments.\n\nIn June 2020, we completed the acquisition of $2,379 of 37/39 GHz spectrum in an FCC auction. Prior to the auction, we exchanged the 39 GHz licenses with a book value of approximately $300 that were previously acquired through FiberTower Corporation for vouchers to be applied against the winning bids and recorded a $900 gain in the first quarter of 2020. These vouchers yielded a value of approximately $1,200, which was applied toward our gross bids. In the second quarter of 2020, we made the final cash payment of $949, bringing the total cash payment to $1,186.\n\nIn December 2019, we acquired $982 of 24 GHz spectrum in an FCC auction.\n\nHBO Latin America Group (HBO LAG) In May 2020, we acquired the remaining interest in HBO LAG for $141, net of cash acquired. At acquisition, we remeasured the fair value of the total business, which exceeded the carrying amount of our equity method investment and resulted in a pre-tax gain of $68. We consolidated that business upon close and recorded those assets at fair value, including $640 of trade names, $271 of distribution networks and $346 of goodwill that is reported in the WarnerMedia segment.\n\n## Dispositions\n\nVideo Business On July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV, which is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&amp;T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, we contributed our U.S. Video business unit to DIRECTV for $4,250 of junior preferred units, an additional distribution preference of $4,200 and a 70% economic interest in common units (collectively 'equity considerations'). TPG contributed approximately $1,800 in cash to DIRECTV for $1,800 of senior preferred units and a 30% economic interest in common units. See Note 10 for additional information on our accounting for our investment in DIRECTV.\n\nUpon close of the transaction in the third quarter, we received approximately $7,170 in cash from DIRECTV ($7,600, net of $430 cash on hand) and transferred $195 of DIRECTV debt. Approximately $1,800 of the cash received is reported as cash received from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows, as it relates to a note payable to DIRECTV, for which payment is tied to our agreement to cover net losses under the remaining term of the NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract up to a cap of $2,100 over the remaining period of the contract. The remainder of the net proceeds is reported as cash from investing activities. This transaction did not result in a material gain or loss.",

The borrowings carry an average stated interest rate of 7.93%, but the effective interest rate is lower at 5.75%, likely due to interest rate management strategies. The maturity structure varies significantly between the two parks: Hong Kong Disneyland Resort has a loan of $68 million maturing in September 2025 at an interest rate of three-month HIBOR plus 2%, while Shanghai Disney Resort has a larger loan of $1.2 billion at 8% interest maturing in 2036, with early repayment permitted based on available cash flows.",

      "question": "How does Disney's strategic positioning of National Geographic across its DTC platforms, financial performance of the National Geographic business, and ownership structure collectively reflect its role and value within Disney's broader entertainment ecosystem?",
      "answer": "Disney strategically integrates National Geographic content across its DTC platforms, particularly Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar, where it appears as a top-level branded tile, contributing to the general entertainment and family programming that drives subscription revenue. As of September 28, 2024, Disney+ had approximately 123 million paid subscribers globally, and Disney+ Hotstar had approximately 36 million paid subscribers, indicating the scale at which National Geographic content reaches consumers. However, financial reports note a decline in the performance of the National Geographic business in fiscal 2024, contributing to a decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Despite this, Disney maintains a 73% ownership stake in National Geographic, which is part of the Entertainment segment and also includes the National Geographic magazine and online business. This ownership structure allows Disney to continue leveraging National Geographic\u2019s brand and content while managing its financial trajectory within the broader entertainment portfolio.",

        "Hop 2: [DIS](page_36) \u2192 [National Geographic]: The National Geographic business experienced lower results in fiscal 2024, contributing to a decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, indicating financial underperformance or restructuring challenges.",

      "question": "How does Disney's monetization of post-production services through licensing and distribution activities align with its broader entertainment segment revenue streams and cost structure, particularly when considering both domestic and international content delivery models?",
      "answer": "Disney monetizes post-production services through fees generated from licensing its intellectual property and providing services such as those offered by Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound (page_78). These services are part of the broader 'Other revenue' category, which also includes music licensing, stage play ticket sales, and consumer products merchandise licensing (page_79). The revenue from these services contributes to the Entertainment segment\u2019s diversified income sources, including subscription fees, advertising, and affiliate fees. However, the cost structure of the Entertainment segment includes significant operating expenses, such as programming and production costs, amortization of capitalized production costs, and distribution costs (page_5). These costs are necessary to support both domestic and international content delivery models, including direct-to-consumer platforms like Disney+ and Hulu, as well as traditional linear networks. Thus, while post-production services generate incremental revenue, they operate within a larger framework of content creation and distribution that requires substantial investment in production and delivery infrastructure.",

      "answer": "Verizon accounts for device payment plans by recognizing a contract liability due to billing credits offered to customers who maintain service, which are included in the transaction price and allocated to performance obligations (page 61). These plans involve a financing component, though Verizon has determined it is not significant, and they also include trade-in rights that are accounted for as guarantee obligations, reducing device revenue (page 60). In the Consumer segment, device payment plans are a key promotional tool used to attract and retain customers, offering installment-based device acquisition with lower service fees compared to older fixed-term plans, and are often paired with trade-in incentives to encourage upgrades (page 5). Synthesizing these perspectives, Verizon's financial treatment reflects the promotional and strategic use of device payment plans in the Consumer market, where billing credits and trade-in rights are not only marketing tools but also have distinct accounting implications that affect revenue recognition and contract liabilities.",

This results in the creation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents the recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed.\n\nFor our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability .\n\nWe may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled after considering expected returns. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We also may provide credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.\n\n## Wireline Contracts\n\nTotal consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on our standalone selling price for each service. While many contracts include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone basis without any promotional discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights  and  obligations  in  our  contract  with  customers  such  as  penalties  that  a  customer  would  have  to  pay  to  early  terminate  a  fix ed-term  contract.  The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of transaction price and related disclosures.\n\nWe may provide performance-based credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with our Business customers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price.

This principal-versus-agent assessment involves judgment and focuses on whether the facts and circumstances of the arrangement indicate that the goods or services were controlled by us prior to transferring them to the customer. T o evaluate if we have control, we consider various factors including whether we are primarily responsible for fulfillment, bear risk of loss and have discretion over pricing.\n\n## Other\n\nWe  offer  telematics  services  including  smart  fleet  management  and  optimization  software.  T elematics  service  revenue  is  generated  primarily  through subscription contracts. We recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts.\n\nWe report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis.\n\n## Maintenance and Repairs\n\nWe charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs are incurred.\n\n## Advertising Costs\n\nCosts for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the periods in which they are incurred.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under T opic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest recognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement.\n\n## Nature of Products and Services\n\n## Telecommunications\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. M onthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability . See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).\n\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability , and serv ice rev enue is recogniz ed ov er the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\n\n## Equipment\n\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the V erizon brand and other brands.  Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we  have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans (for our Business customers) and device payment plans.\n\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically  for a term of 36 months or less).\n\nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, ty pically  ov er a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.\n\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitativ e and quantitativ e considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fix ed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately . See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.\n\n## Wireless Contracts\n\nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.\n\nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The total",

FWA  enables fixed broadband access using radio frequencies instead of cables and can be used to connect homes and businesses to the internet. A s of December 31, 2024, we had nearly 4.6 million FWA broadband connections.\n\nConsumer and Business offer several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches. Oftentimes, we offer promotional trade in offers to incentivize new customers or existing customer upgrades. Consumer wireless customers can acquire wireless equipment from us using device payment plans, which permit the customer to pay for the device in installments over time. Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program generally pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge is included on their wireless monthly bill. While we no longer offer Consumer customers fixed-term subsidized service plans for devices, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers. We also continue to service existing plans for customers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the V erizon device payment program.\n\n## Verizon Consumer Group\n\nIn addition to wireless services and equipment for retail customers, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and  voice  services,  and  wireless  network  access  to  resellers  on  a  wholesale  basis.  Consumer  also  provides  non-connectivity  services  including  device protection, content offerings, cloud storage, and other products.\n\nResidential fixed services - We provide residential fixed connectivity solutions to customers over our 100% fiber-optic network through our V erizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.

      "answer": "The $128M increase in contract assets tied to Fios services during 2024 reflects growing customer adoption and upfront investment in these offerings, which contributes to the Business Markets and Other segment\u2019s revenue of $13.1 billion\u2014representing 44% of total Business revenues. This growth in Fios services appears to partially offset the broader Business segment\u2019s overall revenue decline, driven largely by a $702M drop in wireline offerings such as networking, traditional data, and voice communication services within the Enterprise and Public Sector. The segment-level data suggests that while legacy wireline services face secular decline, Fios services are emerging as a strategic counterbalance, supported by increased contract assets and positioned to stabilize or grow Business Markets and Other revenue in the medium term.",

This strategic positioning is mirrored in the financial statements, where the company's significant capital investments in network infrastructure\u2014including spectrum acquisition and fiber\u2014are accounted for under long-lived asset categories, with depreciation and amortization directly impacting segment EBITDA and operating income. Operationally, the company tracks FWA broadband connections, which are explicitly delivered over 4G LTE or 5G networks, as a key performance metric, showing that 4G LTE remains critical to expanding broadband access and customer acquisition, particularly in areas not served by Fios.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the Company , collectively , V erizon), is one of the world's leading providers of communications, technology , information and streaming products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers' demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity and security.\n\nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - V erizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and V erizon Business Group (Business).\n\nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the V erizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA ) broadband through our fifth-generation (5G) or fourth-generation (4G) Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) networks as an alternative  to  traditional  landline  internet  access.  Our  wireline  serv ices  are  prov ided  in nine  states  in  the  M id-A tlantic  and  Northeastern  U.S.,  as  well  as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our V erizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\n\nOur  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  FWA   broadband,  data,  video  and  advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity , involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well  as  variable  interest  entities  (V IE)  where  we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary .  For  controlled  subsidiaries  that  are  not  wholly -owned,  the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and T otal equity . Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence  over  operating  and  financial  policies,  are  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method.  Equity  method  investments  are  included  in  Investments  in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nWe  prepare  our  financial  statements  using  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GA A P),  which  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of property , plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability , fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible  assets,  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  valuation  allowances  on  tax  assets,  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  obligations,  contingencies  and  the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large enterprise and government customers. We account for these revenues under Topic 606.",

The churn rate in each period presented is calculated by dividing retail  disconnects,  retail  postpaid  disconnects,  or  retail  postpaid  phone  disconnects  by  the  average  retail connections, average retail postpaid connections, or average retail postpaid phone connections, respectively, in the period.\n\nWireless retail postpaid ARPA is the calculated average retail postpaid service revenue per account (A RPA ) from retail postpaid accounts in the period. Wireless retail postpaid service revenue does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the V erizon device payment program, plan billings related to device warranty and insurance or regulatory fees. Wireless retail postpaid A RPA  in each period presented is calculated by dividing retail postpaid service revenue by the average retail postpaid accounts in the period.\n\nWireless retail postpaid accounts are wireless retail customers that are directly served and managed under the Verizon brand and use its services as of the end of the period. A ccounts include unlimited plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single connection plans and multi-connection family plans. A  single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Wireless retail postpaid accounts are calculated by adding retail postpaid new accounts to the prior period retail postpaid accounts.\n\nWireless retail postpaid connections per account is the calculated average number of retail postpaid connections per retail postpaid account as of the end of the period. Wireless retail postpaid connections per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the end of the period.\n\nSegment operating income margin reflects the profitability  of the segment as a percentage of revenue. Segment operating income margin is calculated by dividing total segment operating income by total segment operating revenues.\n\nSegment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA) , which is presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment  EBITDA  is  calculated  by  adding  back  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  to  segment  operating  income  (loss).  Segment  EBITDA   margin  is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues.

Additionally, the document highlights experiments with Search and Shopping ads integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and conversational mode in Search Generative Experience, suggesting that these innovations contributed to increased advertiser value and user engagement.

      "answer": "Google's indemnification agreements with Google Network Partners pose a potential financial liability, though no material claims were probable or reasonably possible as of December 31, 2023. These partners are also a direct cost of revenue, with payments made to them for ads displayed on their properties recorded under Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), which is expected to increase as advertising revenues grow. Furthermore, management anticipates that TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues will be influenced by factors such as device mix, geographic and partner mix, and revenue share terms\u2014highlighting the strategic and financial dependency Google has on these partners across legal, operational, and forward-looking planning contexts.",

      "question": "How does Alphabet's use of Class C stock in employee compensation align with its share repurchase strategy and shareholder structure, particularly in light of the equal dividend and liquidation rights across stock classes?",
      "answer": "Alphabet uses Class C stock as the primary vehicle for employee compensation through RSUs, with $21.7 billion worth of awards expected to be settled in stock in 2023. At the same time, the company repurchases both Class A and Class C shares based on market conditions, with no preference between the two classes. Despite these activities, the company maintains that all stock classes have equal dividend and liquidation rights, ensuring a proportionate allocation of earnings and distributions. This alignment reflects a balanced approach to capital allocation that considers both talent retention and shareholder value while preserving structural equity across stock classes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [GOOGL](page_83) \u2192 [Class C Stock]: Class C stock is the form of equity issued upon vesting of RSUs under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan, with $21.7 billion of stock-based compensation in 2023 tied to awards expected to settle in Class C shares.",
        "Hop 2: [GOOGL](page_81) \u2192 [Class C Stock]: Class C shares are repurchased alongside Class A shares based on market conditions, with repurchases executed to support shareholder value without class-based preference.",

      "answer": "The Basic with Ads tier was introduced at $6.99, significantly lower than the $15.49 Standard and $22.99 Premium tiers, suggesting a strategy to attract price-sensitive users. Page 50 notes that the Basic with Ads tier was launched to 'broaden accessibility,' indicating an intent to increase subscriber volume. Page 52 states that the Standard tier remains the most popular, implying it may still dominate revenue despite the new offering. Page 56 reports that total members grew to 260 million, with the new tier contributing to this increase, though it does not specify the exact mix. Given the lower price point, the Basic tier likely contributes less per-user revenue compared to the Standard and Premium tiers, which may affect overall ARPU unless offset by significantly higher adoption.",

      "answer": "Netflix's strategic expansion into games is reflected in its operational scaling efforts, including the introduction of games as a feature to enhance member engagement and diversify its entertainment offerings. This initiative is tied to its broader risk exposure, as outlined in the Risk Factors section, where competition from dedicated video gaming providers is explicitly mentioned as a threat to member retention and growth. Additionally, the company's financial reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements highlights its significant content investments, including in games, which are part of its broader strategy to maintain differentiation and competitiveness. However, the financial commitment to games development, while not quantified in the provided excerpts, implies a material allocation of resources that must be weighed against the risk of not achieving expected returns due to market saturation or superior offerings from dedicated gaming competitors.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fix ed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our ex penditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## If we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live programming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not done in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits or generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our ex isting members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers and platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant",

They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies more effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n## If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nNetflix , Inc. (the 'Company') was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical ex perience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 22040): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific ex pense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.\n\n## Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , requiring public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments' significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 12 Segment and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Shortterm investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in 'Interest and other income (ex pense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.",

      "question": "How does Netflix's increase in content amortization expense relate to their content investment strategy and the auditing complexities around content amortization modeling?",
      "answer": "Netflix's cost of revenues increased by $1,104 million in 2024 due to higher content amortization, reflecting their aggressive investment in acquiring, licensing, and producing content, which is capitalized and amortized over time based on expected viewing patterns. This strategy leads to complex accounting challenges, particularly in estimating amortization schedules, which are based on historical and forecasted viewing data and require significant management judgment. The company's auditors specifically tested the assumptions and data behind these amortization models, acknowledging the subjectivity involved and the potential financial impact if actual viewing patterns differ from estimates. Together, these elements show how Netflix's content spending directly affects financial performance while introducing modeling risks that require careful oversight.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company's intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\n## Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as 'Content assets, net' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use over ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically ex pects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company's behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company's service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company's content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax  positions, tax -related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the ex pected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables primarily consist of membership and advertising fees due to the Company. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and ex ternal market factors.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "answer": "Netflix's ability to maintain member retention rates above 90% hinges on a complex interplay between its content licensing agreements, internal talent strategy, and device accessibility. From page 4, the company emphasizes that its content library depends on licenses from studios and content providers, noting that 'if studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.' This directly impacts the availability of exclusive and popular content that drives member satisfaction. On page 10, the company outlines its strategy to 'develop and expand an advertising sales and advertising technology organization team,' which signals a shift in human capital investment toward supporting new revenue models while maintaining content curation teams to 'select titles we add and renew to our service' for member delight. Finally, page 8 highlights the dependency on device partners, stating that 'if partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch... our service may be adversely impacted,' underscoring the importance of maintaining broad and seamless device access.

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, members and other stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') matters, both in the United States and internationally, including the adoption of new disclosure and regulatory frameworks. To the extent we are unable to meet regulatory or industry standards or investor expectations on ESG issues or the content we distribute and the manner in which we produce content creates ESG related concerns, our reputation may be harmed.\n\n## Our business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\n\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments (some of which may be unforeseen) include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and ex pected synergies; and diversion of management's time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the ex tent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\n## We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV settop boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV settop boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream content and offer games to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices' performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, and from time to time, lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\n## We are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill members on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition members or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may",

These settlements highlight the significant financial exposure associated with regulatory scrutiny. However, despite these resolutions, ongoing litigation with state attorneys general, such as the appeal of the District of Columbia case and the upcoming trial in New Mexico, indicates continued legal and reputational risks.

With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action.  On  December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us.  The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors appealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness  of  the  modified  consent  order.  The  state  attorneys  general  inquiries  and  litigation  and  certain  government  inquiries  in  other  jurisdictions  remain ongoing. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and include,  among others,  a  prohibition  on  our  use  of  minors'  data  for  any  commercial  purposes,  changes  to  the  composition  of  our  board  of  directors,  and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v. Facebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The underlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to rule.\n\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ),  asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the district court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss our complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy ( Jarkesy ). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending appeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy . Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The district court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to dismiss.",

In addition, we have been and continue to be the subject of litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect and use information, including where advertisers are subject to additional regulation such as housing, employment, credit, and financial services. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation, and certain government inquiries in other  jurisdictions  remain  ongoing.  The  FTC  also  continues  to  monitor  us  and  our  compliance  with  the  modified  consent  order  and  initiated  an  administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. In addition, we are subject to inquiries and investigations by the European Commission regarding our compliance with various provisions of the DSA relating to the use of Facebook and Instagram, including matters related to elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, and minors and other vulnerable users. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to penalties, fines, and requirements to change our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, in July 2024, we entered into a settlement to resolve a lawsuit by the state of Tex as in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" feature and other uses of facial recognition technology.\n\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and  WhatsApp in 2014.  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in November 2024, the European Commission issued a fine as a result of its finding that we tied Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For ex ample, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee.\n\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\n\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\n\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative",

We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney G eneral's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and include,  among others,  a  prohibition  on  our  use  of  minors'  data  for  any  commercial  purposes,  changes  to  the  composition  of  our  board  of  directors,  and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v. Facebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The underlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to rule.\n\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ),  asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the district court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss our complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy ( Jarkesy ). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending appeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy . Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The district court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to dismiss.\n\nOn April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the Order to Show Cause proceeding was legally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners on those issues on November 12, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the Commission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta's jurisdictional challenges currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. , and that the nature and scope of any further administrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.\n\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under",

      "question": "How does Meta's disclosure of ongoing tax inquiries and uncertain tax positions reconcile with the broader context of global regulatory and litigation risks, especially in light of its $9.99 billion liability for uncertain tax positions and active investigations by the European Commission and CFPB?",
      "answer": "Meta faces a complex landscape of global regulatory scrutiny and litigation, including significant exposure from tax inquiries, which is exemplified by its $9.99 billion liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. This uncertainty is compounded by ongoing investigations from the European Commission, which opened formal proceedings on April 30, 2024, to assess compliance with the Digital Services Act (DSA) on issues including political advertising and disinformation. Additionally, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) initiated a NORA process on September 18, 2024, related to financial product advertising on Meta\u2019s platform, which could lead to legal action and financial penalties. These regulatory pressures intersect with Meta's broader exposure to litigation and investigations across privacy, antitrust, and content moderation, as noted in its Item 3 Legal Proceedings. The combination of tax uncertainties, evolving regulatory regimes, and the potential for substantial financial and operational consequences creates a multi-dimensional risk profile that could materially impact Meta\u2019s financial position and strategic flexibility.",

We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\n\n## Leases and Contractual Commitments\n\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include data centers, offices and colocations. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities  consolidation  restructuring  efforts  did  not  materially  change  our  operating  lease  obligations.  Our  contractual  commitments  are  primarily  related  to  our investments in servers and network infrastructure, and content costs from content providers whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion, which mature  from  2027  through  2064.  Short-term  and  long-term  future  interest  payments  obligations  as  of  December  31,  2024  were  $1.39  billion  and  $28.10  billion, respectively.\n\n## Capital Return Program\n\n## Share Repurchase\n\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $29.75 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $51.28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.\n\n## Dividend\n\nWe paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2.00 for each share of Class A and Class B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and dividend equivalents on our outstanding common stock.\n\n## Taxes\n\nCash paid for income taxes was $10.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had taxes payable of $718 million related to a one-time transition tax  payable incurred as a result of the Tax  Act, which is due within one year.\n\nOur long-term income taxes include $9.99 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.",

Legal Proceedings\n\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to numerous claims, litigation, regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal proceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these matters are without merit and are vigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved adversely or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide to settle litigation, disputes, or other legal proceedings in some instances on terms that  are  unfavorable  to  us.  In  addition,  we  may  become  subject  to  orders  or  consent  decrees  imposed  by  government  or  regulatory  authorities.  Any  such developments  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs,  ex pose  us  to  civil  and  criminal  liability  (including  liability  for  our  personnel)  or  penalties  (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have experienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the past, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in light of complex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and advertiser base.\n\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving the company have increased, and there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid or limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to dismiss, including through the use of products liability theories. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in non-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining guidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the G eneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are facing inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe, including class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage) and/or injunctions in respect of alleged failings to comply with such regulatory requirements. We are also responding to litigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing or contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud, unlawful discrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people. This is in addition to significant tax , competition and antitrust, stockholder, commercial, consumer, and privacy litigation and investigations. Furthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential exposure to substantial damages awards and fines has increased.\n\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have not previously been enforced, or where the nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be very difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the nature and extent of injunctive or other non-monetary relief and the applicability and amount of any potential forfeitures, disgorgement, fines or penalties.  While we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can be no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our activities will not result from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\n\n## Privacy and Related Matters\n\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action.  On  December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors appealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state",

We are also responding to regulatory inquiries and litigation related to allegedly deceptive advertising, including but not limited to financial scams, in other parts of the world.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise (NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products and services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the Director of the CFPB that the Bureau take legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged receipt and use for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as well as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided us with an opportunity to respond. We disagree with the claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded through the NORA process. The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action against us, the CFPB could file a lawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  subject  to  litigation  and  other  proceedings  involving  law  enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in  Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\n\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we expect to be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes in the future.\n\n## Item 4.

      "question": "How does Meta's introduction of less personalized ads in Europe reflect regulatory pressures, and what are the implications for advertising revenue and user engagement?",
      "answer": "Meta introduced the option for users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland to see less personalized ads in November 2024 in response to regulatory developments, including scrutiny from the European Commission under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the European Data Protection Board under GDPR. This product change follows the company's earlier introduction of a 'subscription for no ads' model, which is currently under formal investigation by the European Commission, with preliminary findings indicating non-compliance with DMA requirements. The less personalized ads option is expected to result in ads that are less relevant and effective compared to premium offerings, which directly impacts Meta's ability to monetize its advertising platform. This shift has already led to challenges in targeting and measuring ad effectiveness, negatively affecting advertising revenue. Additionally, regulatory-driven product changes, combined with limitations from third-party platforms like Apple and Google, have reduced the availability of data signals used for ad targeting, further diminishing advertiser ROI and potentially impacting user growth and engagement.",

Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney G eneral as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EUU.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy  Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies.  In addition, the ePrivacy  Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response  to  regulatory  developments  in  Europe,  we  announced  plans  to  change  the  legal  basis  for  behavioral  advertising  on  Facebook  and  Instagram  in  the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024, reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation in March 2025. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads,",

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other U.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing additional rights for users and could result in restrictions  on  our  use  of  signals  from  third-party  apps  and  websites  through  certain  browser-  and  device-based  universal  opt-out  mechanisms.  Judicial  and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past.

For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\n\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021.

We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to",

We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations.

      "answer": "Reels' lower monetization rate compared to Feed and Stories creates a dual effect on Meta's advertising revenue in 2024. On one hand, the increased user engagement with Reels drives higher ad impression volumes\u2014growing 11% year-over-year\u2014which contributes to overall advertising revenue growth of 22%. However, the fact that Reels ads monetize at lower rates partially offsets the potential revenue gains from this increased volume. Despite this, Meta continues to strategically invest in Reels, recognizing its importance in driving user engagement and long-term platform stickiness, even if it comes at the expense of near-term monetization efficiency. This reflects a calculated trade-off between current revenue yield and future growth potential.",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.

We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.\n\n## Advertising\n\nAdvertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad. In 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28% increase in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in all regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In 2024, the average price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The increase in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by an increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement tools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled \"-Executive Overview of Full Y ear 2024 Results.\" In addition, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and ad impressions delivered.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nFoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by WhatsApp Business Platform revenue.\n\n## Reality Labs\n\nRL revenue in 2024 increased $250 million, or 13%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to an increase in RL consumer hardware products sold.\n\n## Revenue Seasonality\n\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and 16% between the third and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17% compared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.",

We expect these and other developments will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads and may negatively impact our advertising revenue and user engagement. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We subsequently began offering users in the region who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and G oogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\n\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products.  We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.\n\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect  that  some  of  these  efforts  will  be  long-term  initiatives,  and  that  the  legislative,  regulatory  and  platform  developments  described  above  will  continue  to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with global content, security, and integrity obligations. Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and marketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we expect that the continued enhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material.\n\n## Other Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\n\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, high  interest  rates,  and  related  market  uncertainty,  which  has  led  to  reduced  marketer  spending.  While  we  saw  improvement  in  business  and  macroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial results in future periods.\n\nIn addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics, in particular younger users. In addition, while Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time due to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.",

      "answer": "Meta's exposure to the FTC's administrative proceeding is discussed with increasing specificity across the three sections. In the risk factor section (page 42), the company warns that an adverse outcome could impose significant limitations on its ability to launch new products and use data from users under 18. In the litigation section (page 53), Meta discloses the FTC's proposed order, which includes a prohibition on using minors' data for commercial purposes, changes to board composition, and restrictions on product development.

Together, these perspectives reveal a multi-dimensional risk encompassing financial penalties (e.g., $5.0 billion FTC settlement referenced in page 53), operational limitations, and strategic trade-offs in product innovation and data usage.",

      "question": "How do Meta's technical limitations in detecting violating accounts, combined with their Family metrics' error margins and data signal constraints, impact the reliability of their user growth metrics for investors evaluating platform trustworthiness and advertising effectiveness?",
      "answer": "Meta faces significant technical limitations in estimating violating accounts, with approximately 3% of their worldwide MAP estimated to consist solely of such accounts in Q4 2023, based on internal reviews of limited account samples. These estimates are inherently judgment-based and subject to algorithmic or technical errors. At the same time, Meta acknowledges a 3% error margin for their Family metrics (DAP and MAP), which are calculated using complex machine learning models that match accounts across products using data signals like IP addresses and device information. However, data signal constraints\u2014especially on encrypted platforms like WhatsApp, where only phone numbers and device information are available\u2014further increase the risk of error. These limitations not only affect the accuracy of user growth metrics but also raise concerns about platform trustworthiness and the effectiveness of Meta's advertising ecosystem, as inaccurate metrics could lead to reduced advertiser confidence and potential financial repercussions.",

      "question": "How might limitations in Meta's Family metrics, including algorithm errors and encrypted platform constraints, affect investor confidence in reported user growth and geographic revenue allocation?",
      "answer": "Meta's Family metrics, which consolidate user activity across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, are calculated using complex algorithms and machine learning models that inherently carry the risk of algorithm errors. These errors, combined with data limitations, can lead to inaccuracies in estimating the number of unique users, with an estimated error margin of approximately 3% of worldwide MAP. Additionally, Meta faces specific challenges with encrypted products like WhatsApp, where limited data signals (e.g., reliance primarily on phone numbers and device information) reduce the accuracy of user matching across platforms. This can further undermine the reliability of Family metrics, especially as evolving methodologies or loss of data signals may impact metric stability. On a geographic level, Meta's revenue allocation by user location is also affected by algorithmic or technical errors, as user location data\u2014based on IP addresses and self-disclosed information\u2014may not always reflect actual locations due to proxies or other factors. Together, these limitations create uncertainty around user growth trends and revenue attribution, potentially affecting investor confidence in the accuracy and consistency of Meta's reported performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META (page_4) \u2192 Algorithm Errors: Discloses that Family metrics rely on complex algorithms and machine learning models that are susceptible to algorithm errors and statistical variances, with an estimated error margin of approximately 3% of worldwide MAP.",
        "Hop 2: META (page_31) \u2192 Algorithm Errors: Impacted_By: Notes that algorithm accuracy is further constrained by limited data signals, especially for encrypted products like WhatsApp, where matching accounts is more difficult and may evolve over time, introducing additional risk of error.",
        "Hop 3: META (page_6) \u2192 Algorithm Errors: Impacted_By: Highlights that geographic revenue allocation is also affected by algorithm or technical errors, as IP addresses and self-disclosed location data may misrepresent actual user locations, impacting revenue reporting by region."

      "answer": "Meta introduced the 'subscription for no ads' model in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland in November 2023 as a direct response to regulatory developments (page_20). This change was made in part to shift the legal basis for behavioral advertising from 'legitimate interests' to 'consent,' aligning with GDPR and DMA compliance requirements (page_41). The move was also a strategic response to advertising risk factors outlined in the filing, including the impact of regulatory changes on ad targeting and measurement capabilities, which have already caused marketers to reduce spending due to privacy-related constraints (page_19). Meta continues to engage with regulators to ensure this model complies with evolving GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws, indicating a broader strategy of adapting product offerings to mitigate legal and regulatory exposure while attempting to preserve user engagement and revenue (page_41).",

      "answer": "Meta's definition of Daily Active Users (DAUs) explicitly includes users who access Messenger, even if they don't engage directly with Facebook's core platform, indicating Messenger's integral role in user engagement metrics. This aligns with the forward-looking statements that frame the 'Family'\u2014including Messenger\u2014as a unified ecosystem designed to enhance user connectivity across platforms. Furthermore, the business description of Messenger emphasizes its purpose as a cross-platform communication tool that connects users with friends, family, and businesses, reinforcing its strategic importance in maintaining and growing Meta's user base. Together, these perspectives show that Messenger is not only a communication product but also a key driver of Facebook's DAU growth and, by extension, its advertising revenue potential as outlined in the forward-looking context.",

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS OF THE BUSINESS\n\n2025 Revenue Trends We expect revenue growth in our wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by wireless network enhancements through 5G deployment and our fiber network expansion. We believe that our simplified go-to-market strategy for 5G in underpenetrated markets will continue to contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that expansion of our fiber footprint and our multi-gig offerings will drive greater demand for broadband services on our fast-growing fiber network, as well as increasing our converged customers that have both wireless and fiber.\n\nAs we expand our fiber reach, we will be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity to offset continuing declines in legacy Business Wireline products by growing connectivity with small to mid-sized businesses. We plan to use our strong fiber and wireless assets, broad distribution and integrated product offerings to strengthen our overall market position. We will continue to rationalize our product portfolio with a longer-term shift of the business to fiber and mobile connectivity, and growth in value-added services. As customers are demanding faster and more reliable services, we are decommissioning our legacy copper network and enhancing our offerings to include services that provide better experiences over new technologies, such as AT&amp;T Internet Air.\n\n2025 Expense Trends During 2025, we expect expense trends consistent with the prior year, and that we will continue to focus on efficiency, led by our cost transformation initiative. We expect the spending required to support growth and efficiency initiatives, primarily our continued deployment of fiber and 5G, to pressure expense trends in 2025. These investments will help prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming, augmented reality, 'smart' technologies, user generated content and artificial intelligence (AI). The software benefits of our 5G wireless technology should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. Furthermore, to the extent customers upgrade their handsets in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\nWe continue to transform our operations to be more efficient and effective. We are restructuring businesses, working with regulators and customers to sunset legacy networks, improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation, sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels, and reassessing overall benefit costs. We also expect cost savings through AI-driven efficiencies in our network design and operations, software development, sales, marketing, customer support services and general and administrative costs.\n\nMarket Conditions In recent years, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates, inflation and an increasing interest rate environment continued to produce volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. We expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2025 as we respond to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and our competitive marketplace, especially in wireless services.\n\nIncluded on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits. Our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). We expect only minimal ERISA contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2025. Investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans. In addition, our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions; however, these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in 'Other income (expense) - net.' Changes in our discount rate, which are tied to changes in the bond market, and changes in the performance of equity markets, may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2025 (see 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates').\n\nExpected Growth Areas Over the next few years, we expect our growth to come from wireless and IP-based fiber broadband services. We provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the U.S. on a converged telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms. In 2025, our key initiatives include:\n\n- Continuing our wireless subscriber momentum and 5G deployment, with expansion of wireless subscribers in underpenetrated markets and converged customers.\n- Continuing our fiber deployment, improving fiber penetration, growing AT&amp;T Internet Air services, accelerating subscriber growth and increasing broadband revenues.\n- Deploying Open RAN to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, fostering lower network costs, improved operational efficiencies and allowing for continued investment in our fast-growing broadband network.\n- Continuing to drive efficiencies and a competitive advantage through cost transformation initiatives and product simplification.",

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## Dollars in millions ex cept per share amounts\n\n## General\n\nWe are a leading provider of telecommunications and technology services globally. The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\n\nThe Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the United States and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect integrated product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\n- Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n- Business Wireline provides advanced ethernet-based fiber services, fixed wireless services, IP Voice and managed professional services, as well as legacy voice and data services and related equipment, to business customers.\n- Consumer Wireline provides broadband services, including fiber connections that provide multi-gig services, and our fixed wireless access product (AT&amp;T Internet Air or 'AIA') that provides internet services delivered over our 5G wireless network, to residential customers in select locations. Consumer Wireline also provides legacy telephony voice communication services.\n\nThe Latin America segment provides wireless service and equipment in Mexico.\n\nCorporate support costs, including administrative support costs borne by AT&amp;T where business units do not influence decision making and results from business no longer integral to our operations are reported as Corporate and Other , which reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes.\n\n## Areas of Focus\n\nWe are a leader in providing connectivity services through our market focus areas of 5G and fiber. Fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, both wired and wireless. Building on that fiber foundation is our solid spectrum portfolio, strengthened through Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction acquisitions and 5G deployment. We believe our fixed wireline and mobile approach will differentiate our services and provide us with additional convergence growth opportunities in the future as bandwidth demands continue to grow. We will continue to demonstrate our commitment to ensure management attention is sharply focused on growth areas and operational efficiencies.\n\nOur integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms to provide instant connectivity at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements. Streaming, augmented reality, 'smart' technologies, user generated content and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to continue to drive greater demand for broadband, which we believe will allow us to capitalize on our fiber and 5G deployments. During 2025, we are focused on the core capabilities of our products, our infrastructure and our network. Our concentration is to aggregate the most traffic on the largest, lowest marginal cost, converged network through efficient spectrum deployment and construction of the largest high-capacity broadband solutions in the United States, while also working with regulators and customers to decommission high-cost legacy technologies over the next several years.\n\nDuring 2024, we collaborated with Ericsson to lead the U.S. in commercial scale open radio access network (Open RAN) deployment to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, fostering lower network costs, improved operational efficiencies and allowing for continued investment in our fastgrowing broadband network. We plan for about 70% of our wireless network traffic to flow across open-capable platforms by late 2026. Beginning in 2025, we expect to scale this Open RAN environment throughout our wireless network in coordination with multiple suppliers. We believe the move to an open, agile, programmable wireless network positions us to quickly capitalize on the next generation of wireless technology and spectrum when it becomes available. These innovative technologies are expected to enable lower-power, sustainable networks with higher performance to deliver enhanced user experiences.\n\nWireless Service We continue to experience rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices, and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet. The deployment of 5G, which allows for faster connectivity, lower latency and greater bandwidth, requires modifications of existing cell sites to add equipment supporting new frequencies, like the C-Band and the 3.45 GHz band. The increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5G technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services. As the wireless industry has matured, with nearly full penetration of smartphones in the U.S. population, future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services, plans and devices that bundle product offerings and take advantage of our 5G wireless network.\n\nTo support higher mobile data usage, our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible. We expect to continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, as well as obtaining additional spectrum, when available, that meets our long-term needs. We participate in FCC spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support",

Subscribers that bring their own devices or retain handsets for longer periods impact upgrade activity. Like other wireless service providers, we also provide postpaid contract subscribers promotional equipment offers to initiate, renew or upgrade service.\n\nBusiness Wireline Our Business Wireline business unit provides services to business customers, including multinational corporations, small and mid-sized businesses, and governmental and wholesale customers. Our Business Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer fiber and other advanced connectivity services, such as AT&amp;T Dedicated Internet, fiber ethernet and broadband, fixed wireless, and hosted and managed professional services, as well as legacy voice and other transitional services comprised of copper-based voice and data, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), wholesale, outsourcing and IP sales. Historically, a majority of our Business Wireline service revenues came from legacy copper-based voice and data and traditional products; however, over recent years those services have been declining due to secular pressures.\n\nWe continue to reconfigure our wireline network to take advantage of the latest technologies and services, and rely on our SDN and NFV to enhance business customers' digital agility in a rapidly evolving environment. Some of the services we have offered historically are in secular decline and, going forward, we will focus on our owned and operated connectivity services powered by 5G and fiber as well as evaluating opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure.\n\n## Equipment\n\nEquipment revenues include customer premises equipment.\n\nConsumer Wireline - Our Consumer Wireline business unit provides broadband services, including fiber connections, AIA and legacy telephony voice communication services, to customers in the United States by utilizing our IP-based and copper wired network. Our Consumer Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: broadband, legacy voice and data services and other service and equipment.\n\n## Broadband Service\n\nWe provide broadband and internet services to approximately 14.1 million customers, including 9.3 million fiber broadband subscribers at December 31, 2024. With changes in video viewing preferences and the impacts of remote learning trends, we are experiencing increasing demand for high-speed broadband services. We believe our investment in expanding our industry-leading fiber network positions us to be a leader in wired connectivity. Our focus on fiber brings owners economics and expected efficiencies while we continue to evaluate opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure.\n\nWe believe that our flexible platform, with a broadband and wireless connection, is the most efficient way to transport direct-to-consumer video and data experiences both at home and on mobile devices. Through this integrated approach, we can optimize the use of storage in the home as well as in the cloud, while also providing a seamless service for consumers across screens and locations.\n\n## Legacy Voice and Data Services\n\nRevenues from our traditional voice services continue to decline as customers switch to wireless or VoIP services provided by us, cable companies or other internetbased providers.\n\n## Other Service and Equipment\n\nOther service revenues include VoIP services, customer fees and equipment.\n\nAdditional information on our Communications segment is contained in the 'Overview' section of Item 7.\n\n## LATIN AMERICA\n\nOur Latin America segment provides wireless service in Mexico. We utilize our regional and national wireless networks in Mexico to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. The Latin America segment provided approximately 3% of 2024 segment operating revenues and less than 1% of our 2024 total segment operating income. We divide our revenue into the following categories: service and equipment.",

      "answer": "AT&T's investment in DIRECTV has transitioned to a cash flow-based recognition model due to the investment's book value reaching zero in Q3 2024. In 2024, AT&T received $2,955 in total distributions from DIRECTV, which exceeded the carrying value of the investment, resulting in the full amount being recognized in 'Equity in net income of affiliates' ($2,027) and as operating cash flow. This reflects a shift from traditional equity method accounting to a cash-receipts basis. Over the past three years, DIRECTV contributed $2,027 in 2024, $1,666 in 2023, and $1,808 in 2022 to AT&T\u2019s equity income, with distributions consistently outpacing earnings.

We hold a 50% interest in this joint venture, which provides a fiber network in select areas to internet service providers and other businesses across the U.S. We deconsolidated Gigapower's operations and began accounting for it as an equity method investment on May 12, 2023.\n\nSKY Mexico In June 2024, we sold our 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe following table presents summarized financial information for DIRECTV and our other equity method investments, consisting primarily of Gigapower, SKY Mexico (prior to disposition) and certain sports-related programming investments, at December 31, or for the year then ended:\n\n",

The increase reflects cash distributions received by AT&amp;T in excess of the carrying amount of our investment in DIRECTV, partially offset by the performance of our investment in DIRECTV (see Notes 10 and 19).\n\nOther income (expense) - net increased in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by actuarial remeasurement of benefit plan assets and obligations, with an actuarial loss of $56 in 2024, compared to net actuarial and settlement losses of $1,594 in 2023 (see Note 14). Also contributing to the increase was the prior-year writedown of our SKY Mexico equity investment. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments.\n\nIncome tax expense increased in 2024. While our income before income taxes decreased in 2024, it includes a goodwill impairment associated with our Business Wireline reporting unit, which is not deductible for tax  purposes and results in a higher effective tax  rate. Our effective tax  rate was 26.6% in 2024, 21.3% in 2023, and (122.2)% in 2022. The effective tax  rate in 2022 was also impacted by goodwill impairments, which are not deductible for tax  purposes.\n\nSegment Results Our segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We evaluate segment performance based on operating income as well as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. See 'Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures' for a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n",

      "answer": "Comcast's regulatory obligations in the UK and EU, including content-related rules that govern the acquisition and exploitation of sports rights, directly constrain its flexibility in managing both its $64.6 billion future sports rights commitments and rising programming costs. In the UK, Sky is subject to Ofcom regulations that require fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory access to content, including sports programming, through mechanisms like the electronic program guide and conditional access systems. These obligations limit Comcast's ability to exclusively leverage sports content as a competitive differentiator or pricing lever, which in turn affects the ROI expectations from its substantial sports rights investments. Additionally, the company faces increasing programming expenses on a per-subscriber basis, with no assurance that revenue from sports programming will exceed the associated costs. Regulatory constraints on how content can be distributed and monetized, combined with the fixed financial commitments tied to long-term sports rights contracts, create a high-risk environment where Comcast must navigate rising costs without the ability to fully pass them on to consumers or distributors, especially as market dynamics and media consolidation further pressure content acquisition and distribution terms.",

      "question": "How does the strategic importance of Wireless Gateways in CMCSA's residential broadband offerings align with the company's capital expenditure plans and supplier dependency risks?",
      "answer": "Wireless Gateways are positioned as a key enabler of CMCSA's residential broadband strategy, offering integrated Wi-Fi coverage and network management tools to customers (page_7). This aligns with the company's capital expenditure plans, which include continued investment in wireless gateways and next-generation platforms like X1 and Sky Q (page_69). However, the company also acknowledges a supplier concentration risk, noting that a limited number of vendors supply a significant portion of customer premise equipment, including wireless gateways (page_8). This creates a dependency that could impact the rollout and reliability of broadband services if supply chain disruptions occur.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nCommunications segment; and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, X1 and Sky Q. In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks in the future, including the development of our additional theme  park  in  Orlando,  Florida,  which  resumed  in  2021.  Capital  expenditures  for  subsequent  years  will  depend  on  numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented  in  other  financing  activities,  repurchases  of  common  stock  under  our  share  repurchase  program  and  employee  plans, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Net cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted  primarily  of  repayments  of  debt  and  the  related  early  redemption  payments  presented  in  other  financing  activities, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented  in  other  financing  activities,  partially  offset  by  proceeds  from  borrowings  and  proceeds  from  the  settlement  of cross-currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities.\n\nIn August 2021, we completed a debt exchange transaction. We issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, which have maturities ranging from 2051 to 2063 and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.93%, and made cash payments of $0.5 billion in exchange for $11.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2033 to 2058 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.04%. The debt exchange resulted in an overall reduction in the weighted-average interest rate for our total outstanding debt of 0.27% and extended the overall weighted-average maturity by 2 years. The debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, and therefore following the exchange, the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments, and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes.\n\nIn 2021, we made debt repayments of $11.5 billion, including $4.9 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of $3.3 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025, as well as amounts due at maturity and the cash payments in the debt exchange transaction.\n\nIn 2021, we issued \u20ac1.75 billion ($2.1 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate Euro senior notes maturing in 2026 and 2029. In 2021, we had borrowings of $0.6 billion under the Universal Beijing Resort term loan.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. Effective May 25, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. During 2021, we repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion. In January 2022, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization from the $6 billion remaining as of December 31, 2021 to $10 billion. Under the authorization, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares, which may be in the open market or in private transactions.\n\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.6 billion in 2021. We paid dividends of $4.5 billion in 2021. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nThe  chart  below  summarizes  our  share  repurchases  under  our  publicly  announced  share  repurchase  program  authorization  and dividends paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, we paid $674 million and $534 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.",

Customers with wireless gateways may also personalize and manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home, and access advanced security technology and other features, with our xFi whole-home application and online portal.  Broadband  customers  have  access  to  our  expanding  network  of  secure  residential,  outdoor  and  business  Wi-Fi  hotspots nationwide. As part of our low-income broadband adoption program, we also offer qualifying customers our Internet Essentials service, and beginning at the end of 2021 Internet Essential Plus, which have downstream speeds of up to 50 megabits per second and 100 megabits per second, respectively.\n\nBroadband customers that prefer consuming content over the internet rather than linear cable television are eligible to receive our Flex streaming device for no additional charge, which includes integrated search functionality and a voice-activated remote control. Flex also provides access to and the integration of streaming content from Peacock's premium tier; certain third-party internetbased apps providing content and music such as DTC streaming services Disney+ and Netflix; and certain pay-per-view and video on demand content available over the internet. We earn commission revenue from the sale of certain third-party DTC streaming services.\n\n## Video - 17.5 million customers\n\nWe offer a broad variety of video services, primarily through our X1 platform, which provides integrated search functionality and a voice-activated remote control. The integrated features provided by X1 operate across content in customers' cable video services packages and content from internet-based streaming services that customers may access in a manner similar to our Flex streaming device.

We also offer Ethernet network services, which  connect  multiple  locations  and  provide  higher  downstream  and  upstream  speed  options  to  medium-sized  customers  and larger enterprises, and advanced voice services, as well as video solutions for hotels and other large venues. In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help manage their network bandwidth.\n\nOur business services offerings for medium-sized and enterprise customers also include a software-defined networking product, and larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These services are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with  multiple  locations  both  within  and  outside  of  our  cable  distribution  footprint,  where  we  provide  coverage  outside  of  our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells to local, regional and national advertisers as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, and we also generate revenue from selling advertising on our digital  platforms.  Our  advertising  business  also  represents  the  advertising  sales  efforts  of  other  multichannel  video  providers  in some markets and offers additional technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nOur security and automation services provide home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal, mobile apps and the X1 platform. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\n\n## Network and Technology\n\nOur  Cable  Communications  cable  distribution  system  uses  a  hybrid  fiber-optic  and  coaxial  cable  network  that  we  believe  is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities  over  time.  This  network  provides  the  two-way  transmissions  that  are  essential  to  providing  broadband  services, interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  On  Demand  and  DVR,  voice  services,  and  security  and automation  services.  Leveraging  DOCSIS  3.1  technology,  Cable  Communications  currently  deploys  broadband  services  with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\n\nCable  Communications  continues  to  focus  on  technology  initiatives  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  next-generation  media  and content  delivery  platforms,  such  as  the  X1  and  Flex  platforms  and  cloud  DVR  technology  that  use  Internet  Protocol  ('IP') technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other  internet-based  apps,  and  on  demand  content  in  one  unified  experience  with  voice-activated  remote  control  search  and interactive  features.  Cable  Communications  also  pursues  technology  initiatives  related  to  broadband  services  that  leverage  our global technology platform, providing customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our xFi whole-home application and online portal, advanced security technology and other features.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\nTo offer video services, Cable Communications licenses substantial amounts of programming from cable and broadcast networks, as  well  as  from  local  broadcast  television  stations.  The  fees  associated  with  these  programming  distribution  agreements  are generally based on the number of subscribers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our On Demand service, online portal, mobile apps and Flex.\n\nFor  wireless  services,  we  have  an  MVNO  agreement  that  allows  us  to  offer  services  using  Verizon's  wireless  network  and  we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches that we sell to wireless customers.\n\nCable  Communications  purchases  from  a  limited  number  of  suppliers  a  significant  amount  of  customer  premise  equipment, including  wireless  gateways  and  set-top  boxes,  network  equipment  and  services  to  provide  services  to  residential  and  business customers.\n\nCable Communications uses two primary vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",
