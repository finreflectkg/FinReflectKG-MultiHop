      "question": "How has The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's Executive Severance Plan evolved in terms of its filing status, historical amendments, and most recent updates, and what do these changes indicate about the company's executive compensation strategy?",
      "answer": "The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's Executive Severance Plan (ESP) has evolved through multiple stages: it was previously filed as Exhibit 10.13 with an amendment dated February 12, 2018, then referenced again in a 2024 amendment and restatement effective March 1, 2024, and filed as Exhibit 10.30 in the current filing. The most recent update includes changes to the 'Pro-Rata Annual Incentive Award' to allow for a full pro-rated amount (cash and deferred), aligns the definition of 'Cause' with equity award agreements, and incorporates other unspecified changes. This progression shows a consistent but evolving approach to executive severance, with recent refinements indicating a strategic alignment with broader executive compensation frameworks and incentive structures.",

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's frequent amendment of the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, including the most recent changes effective July 1, 2023, aligned with its broader executive compensation strategy as reflected in equity plan share availability and related deferral mechanisms?",
      "answer": "Wells Fargo has consistently amended the Supplemental 401(k) Plan at regular intervals, with updates effective on January 1 in 2020, 2021, 2022, and most recently on July 1, 2023, indicating a dynamic and responsive approach to executive compensation policy. This aligns with the company\u2019s broader equity compensation strategy as evidenced by the 1,693,770 shares remaining available for future issuance under the plan as of 2023, suggesting a structured effort to maintain flexibility in deferral distribution mechanisms. Additionally, the plan\u2019s frequent revisions are mirrored in the broader context of related deferral and compensation programs, such as the Directors Stock Compensation and Deferral Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan, which also show regular updates, reinforcing a coordinated approach to executive retention and incentive alignment.",

      "question": "How does the Dodd-Frank Act influence Wells Fargo's ability to acquire other companies, restrict its capital distribution policies, and shape its enhanced prudential requirements as a large bank holding company?",
      "answer": "The Dodd-Frank Act restricts Wells Fargo\u2019s ability to acquire other companies if the resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies. It also imposes capital distribution restrictions, such as limiting the Parent\u2019s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries if certain liquidity or capital thresholds fall below defined triggers under the Support Agreement. Furthermore, as a large bank holding company, Wells Fargo is subject to enhanced prudential requirements, including stricter capital adequacy, liquidity coverage, and stress testing standards, which directly affect its financial planning and risk management practices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [WFC](page_3) \u2192 [Dodd-Frank Act]: The Dodd-Frank Act is referenced in the regulatory framework section, where it is noted that it imposes enhanced prudential requirements on large BHCs, including capital, liquidity, and stress testing standards.",
        "Hop 2: [WFC](page_4) \u2192 [Dodd-Frank Act]: The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits Wells Fargo from merging or acquiring control of another company if its resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of all financial companies\u2019 liabilities.",
        "Hop 3: [WFC](page_5) \u2192 [Dodd-Frank Act]: The Dodd-Frank Act affects capital distribution policies, particularly through the Support Agreement, which may restrict the IHC from making dividend payments to the Parent if liquidity or capital metrics fall below defined triggers."

      "question": "How does MetLife's treatment of Phantom Stock-Based Awards in terms of liability recognition and fair value adjustments align with the specific compensation expense recognition methods and plan structures outlined in the equity disclosures?",
      "answer": "MetLife accounts for Phantom Stock-Based Awards (such as Unit Options, Performance Units, and Restricted Units) as liabilities, re-measuring their fair value at each reporting period until settlement, based on the change in Share price (page_270). This approach directly informs the compensation expense line item, which includes Phantom Stock-Based Awards and is separately disclosed in the financial statements (page_267). These awards are issued under structured plans like the MetLife, Inc. International Unit Option Incentive Plan and the 2015 Stock Plan, which define vesting terms, eligibility, and the form of awards, and MetLife adjusts compensation expense quarterly for these cash-settled instruments (page_266). Together, these sections show a consistent framework where Phantom Stock-Based Awards are recognized as liabilities, expensed based on fair value changes, and governed by formal plans that dictate their issuance and settlement.",

Otherwise, all values represent weighted average of number of awards multiplied by the fair value per Share at December 31, 2024. Fair value of Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units on December 31, 2024 was equal to Grant Date fair value.\n\n(2) Forfeited awards were either (a) unvested or unexercisable at the end of the awardholder's employment, where the awardholder did not meet the criteria for postemployment award continuation; or (b) held by awardholders the Company terminated from employment for cause as defined in the terms of the awards.\n\n(3) Includes both Shares paid and Deferred Shares.\n\nPerformance Share amounts above represent aggregate awards at target, and do not reflect potential increases or decreases that may result from the performance factor. At December 31, 2024, the performance period for the 2022 - 2024 Performance Share grants was completed, but the performance factor had not yet been determined. Included in the immediately preceding table are 873,665 outstanding Performance Shares to which the 2022 - 2024 performance factor will be applied.\n\n## Liability Awards (Phantom Stock-Based Awards)\n\nCertain MetLife subsidiaries have a liability for Phantom Stock-Based Awards in the form of Unit Options, Performance Units, and/or Restricted Units. These Sharebased cash settled awards are recorded as liabilities until MetLife makes payment. The fair value of unsettled or unvested liability awards is re-measured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one Share. The liability and corresponding expense are adjusted accordingly until the award is settled.\n\n## Unit Options\n\nUnit Options are the contingent right of award holders to receive a cash payment equal to the closing price of a Share on the exercise date, less the closing price on the grant date, if the difference is greater than zero, for a limited time. All Unit Options have an ex ercise price equal to the closing price of a Share reported on the NY SE on the date of grant and have a maximum term of 10 years. The majority of Unit Options have become or will become eligible for exercise at a rate of one-third of each award on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Other Unit Options have become or will become eligible for exercise on the third anniversary of the grant date.

E quity (continued)\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation Plans\n\n## Plans for Employees and Agents\n\nUnder the MetLife, Inc. 2015 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the '2015 Stock Plan'), MetLife, Inc. may grant awards to employees and agents in the form of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares or Performance Share Units, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards and StockBased Awards (each, as applicable, as defined in the 2015 Stock Plan with reference to shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock ('Shares')). Awards under the 2015 Stock Plan and its predecessor plan, the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the '2005 Stock Plan'), were outstanding at December 31, 2024. MetLife, Inc. granted all awards to employees and agents in 2024 under the 2015 Stock Plan.\n\nThe aggregate number of Shares available for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan at December 31, 2024 was 29,284,184.\n\nMetLife recognizes compensation expense related to each award under the 2005 Stock Plan or 2015 Stock Plan in one of two ways:\n\n- For cash-settled awards, MetLife remeasures the compensation expense quarterly.\n- For other awards, MetLife recognizes an expense based on the number of awards it expects to vest, which represents the awards granted less expected forfeitures over the life of the award, as estimated at the date of grant. Unless MetLife observes a material deviation from the assumed forfeiture rate during the term in which the awards are expensed, MetLife recognizes any adjustment necessary to reflect differences in actual experience in the period the award becomes payable or exercisable.\n\nCompensation expense related to awards under the 2005 Stock Plan principally relates to the issuance of Stock Options. Under the 2015 Stock Plan, compensation expense principally relates to Stock Options, Unit Options, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Units. MetLife, Inc. granted the majority of each year's awards under the 2005 Stock Plan prior to 2015, and under the 2015 Stock Plan in 2015 and later in the first quarter of the year.\n\nAwards that have become payable in Shares but the issuance of which has been deferred ('Deferred Shares'), payable to employees or agents related to awards under all plans equaled 627,849 Shares at December 31, 2024.\n\nMetLife granted cash-settled awards based in whole or in part on the price of Shares or changes in the price of Shares ('Phantom Stock-Based Awards') under the MetLife, Inc. International Unit Option Incentive Plan, the MetLife International Performance Unit Incentive Plan, and the MetLife International Restricted Unit Incentive Plan prior to 2015, and under the 2015 Stock Plan in 2015 and later.\n\n## Plans for Non-Management Directors\n\nUnder  the  MetLife,  Inc.  2015  Non-Management  Director  Stock  Compensation  Plan  (the  '2015  Director  Stock  Plan'),  MetLife,  Inc.  may  grant  non-management Directors of MetLife, Inc. awards in the form of nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, or Stock-Based Awards (each, as applicable, as defined in the 2015 Director Stock Plan with reference to Shares).\n\nThe  only  awards  MetLife,  Inc.  granted  under  the  2015  Director  Stock  Plan  and  its  predecessor  plan,  the  MetLife,  Inc.  2005  Non-Management  Director  Stock Compensation Plan (the '2005 Director Stock Plan'), through December 31, 2024 were Stock-Based Awards that vested immediately. As a result, no awards under the 2005 Director Stock Plan or 2015 Director Stock Plan remained outstanding at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe aggregate number of Shares available for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan at December 31, 2024 was 1,376,777.\n\nMetLife recognizes compensation expense related to awards under the 2015 Director Stock Plan based on the number of Shares awarded.\n\nDeferred Shares payable to Directors related to awards under the 2005 Director Stock Plan, 2015 Director Stock Plan, or earlier applicable plans equaled 315,652 Shares at December 31, 2024.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

Derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on financial results under different accounting regimes, including GAAP and local statutory accounting. Our derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged. Some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets. Our use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows:\n\n- Risks Related to G uarantee Benefits - We use a wide range of derivative contracts to mitigate the risk associated with living guarantee benefits accounted for as MRBs. These derivatives include equity and interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, currency futures/forwards, equity indexed options, TRRs, interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps.\n- Minimum Interest Rate Guarantees - For certain liability contracts, we provide the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate. These contracts include certain fix ed annuities and other insurance liabilities. We purchase interest rate caps and floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees.\n- Reinvestment Risk in Long-Duration Liability Contracts - Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long-duration liability contracts. Hedges include interest rate swaps, swaptions and Treasury bond forwards.\n- Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk - We use foreign currency swaps, futures, forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. These hedges are generally used to swap foreign currency denominated bonds, investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity market exposures to U.S. dollars. Our foreign subsidiaries also use these hedges to swap non-local currency assets to local currency assets in order to match liabilities .\n- General ALM Hedging Strategies - In the ordinary course of managing our asset/liability risks, we use interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floors, and inflation swaps. These hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the ex isting assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows.\n- Macro Hedge Program - We use equity options, equity TRRs, interest rate swaptions, interest rate swaps and Treasury locks to mitigate the potential loss of legal entity statutory capital under stress scenarios.\n\n## Risk Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nWe measure market risk related to our market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical 100 basis point change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, as well as a 10% change (increase or decrease) in foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices. We believe these changes in market rates and prices are reasonably possible in the near term. In performing the analysis summarized below, we used market rates at December 31, 2024. The sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of our market risk exposures (interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market) relating to our assets and liabilities. We modeled the impact of changes (increases and decreases) in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of our market sensitive assets and liabilities and present the results with the most adverse level of market risk impact to the Company for each of these market risk exposures as follows:\n\n- the net present values of our interest rate sensitive ex posures resulting from a 100-basis point change (increase or decrease) in interest rates;\n- estimated fair values of our foreign currency exchange rate sensitive exposures due to a 10% change (appreciation or depreciation) in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies; and\n- the estimated fair value of our equity market sensitive ex posures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in equity market prices.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nTo support management of interest rate risk, we perform analysis using various models, including multi-scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments, including derivatives. These projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of our in-force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. The NYDFS regulations require that we perform some of these analyses annually as part of our review of the sufficiency of our regulatory reserves. For several of our legal entities, we maintain segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of ALM and the allocation of investment income to product lines. In the U.S., for each segment, invested assets greater than or equal to the GAAP liabilities, net of certain noninvested assets allocated to the segment, are maintained, with any excess allocated to Corporate &amp; Other. The business segments may reflect differences in legal entity, statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration, liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets. Certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities. We measure relative sensitivities of the value of our assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing internal models. These models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality, morbidity and interest crediting rates. In addition,  these  models  include  asset  cash  flow  projections  reflecting  interest  payments,  sinking  fund  payments,  principal  payments,  bond  calls,  mortgage  loan prepayments and defaults.\n\nWe employ product design, pricing and ALM strategies to reduce the potential effects of interest rate movements. Product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset crediting rates for certain products. ALM strategies include the use of derivatives. We also use reinsurance to mitigate interest rate risk.\n\nWe also use common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the duration of liabilities, we consider policyholder guarantees and how we intend to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends. Each asset portfolio or portfolio group has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets, we may support such liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or interest rate curve mismatch strategies.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Management\n\nMetLife has a well-established policy to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures within its risk tolerance. In general, investments backing specific liabilities are currency matched. This is achieved through direct investments in matching currency or through the use of foreign currency exchange rate derivatives. Enterprise foreign currency exchange rate risk limits are established by the ERC. Management of each of our segments, with oversight from our FX Working G roup and the ALM committee for the respective segment, is responsible for managing any foreign currency exchange rate exposure.\n\nWe use foreign currency swaps, forwards and options to mitigate the liability exposure, risk of loss and financial statement volatility associated with our investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and foreign currency insurance liabilities.\n\n## Equity Market Risk Management\n\nWe manage equity market risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our ALM strategies, including the dynamic hedging with derivatives of certain variable annuity guarantee benefits accounted for as MRBs, as well as reinsurance, in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to large risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We also manage equity market risk exposure in our investment portfolio through the use of derivatives. These derivatives include exchange-traded equity futures, equity index options contracts, TRRs and equity variance swaps.",

      "question": "How does MET's exposure to ABS & CLO, as reflected in fair value and unrealized losses, align with the company's investment risk disclosures and the structure of its fixed maturity securities portfolio?",
      "answer": "MET's exposure to ABS & CLO is detailed across three perspectives: (1) On page 211, MET reports an estimated fair value of $2,840 million for ABS & CLO with gross unrealized losses of $88 million in the less than 12 months category, and $5,831 million fair value with $436 million in gross unrealized losses in the equal to or greater than 12 months category, indicating a significant but relatively low-loss segment of the portfolio. (2) On page 210, the amortized cost of ABS & CLO is $20,973 million with a $9 million allowance for credit loss, showing that MET carries a moderate credit risk exposure to this asset class. (3) On page 209, MET discloses that ABS & CLO include securities backed by consumer and corporate loans, and highlights that income recognition on such structured products is sensitive to prepayment and default assumptions, linking the portfolio composition to financial statement risks. Together, these sections suggest that while ABS & CLO represent a sizable portion of MET\u2019s fixed maturity AFS portfolio, the unrealized losses and credit allowances are relatively contained, though the sensitivity of income recognition to market conditions remains a key risk factor.",

Investments\n\nSee Note 13 for information about the fair value hierarchy for investments and the related valuation methodologies.\n\n## Investment Risks and Uncertainties\n\nInvestments are exposed to the following primary sources of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity, market valuation, currency and real estate risk. The financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks, are those associated with the determination of estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions, the recognition of ACL and impairments, the recognition of income on certain investments and the potential consolidation of VIEs. The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs relating to these financial statement risks may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe determination of ACL and impairments is highly subjective and is based upon quarterly evaluations and assessments of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\n\nThe  recognition  of  income  on  certain  investments  (e.g.  structured  securities,  including  mortgage-backed  securities,  ABS  &amp;  CLO,  certain  structured  investment transactions and FVO securities) is dependent upon certain factors such as prepayments and defaults, and changes in such factors could result in changes in amounts to be earned.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS by Sector\n\nThe following table presents fixed maturity securities AFS by sector. U.S. corporate and foreign corporate sectors include redeemable preferred stock. RMBS includes agency, prime, prime investor, non-qualified residential mortgage, alternative, reperforming and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. ABS &amp; CLO includes securities collateralized by consumer loans, corporate loans, broadly syndicated bank loans, and other assets. Municipals includes taxable and tax-exempt revenue bonds and, to a much lesser extent, general obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions. Commercial mortgage-backed securities ('CMBS') primarily includes securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans. RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS are, collectively, 'Structured Products.'",

      "question": "How does MetLife's treatment of Unit-linked Securities in terms of fair value sensitivity, asset classification, and income recognition reflect the complexity and risk profile associated with these instruments across different financial reporting sections?",
      "answer": "MetLife's treatment of Unit-linked Securities reveals a multifaceted approach across sections: on page 250, the fair value of these securities is shown to be sensitive to mortality, lapse, and equity volatility assumptions, indicating exposure to demographic and market risks. On page 296, Unit-linked Securities are classified as primarily equity and fixed maturity securities, with amortized cost accounting applied, which reflects their nature as long-duration investments. On page 252, changes in the estimated fair value of these securities are recognized directly in net investment income, linking their performance to earnings volatility. Together, these perspectives show that Unit-linked Securities are complex instruments with significant exposure to both market dynamics and policyholder behavior, and their accounting treatment directly impacts both asset valuation and income reporting.",

Fair Value (continued)\n\n- (7) Changes in estimated fair value are based on long U.S. dollar net asset positions and will be inversely impacted for short U.S. dollar net asset positions.\n- (8) Mortality  rates  vary  by  age  and  by  demographic  characteristics  such  as  gender.  Mortality  rate  assumptions  are  based  on  company  ex perience.  A  mortality improvement assumption is also applied. For any given contract, mortality rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs. For contracts that contain only a GMDB, any increase (decrease) in mortality rates result in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of MRBs. Generally, for contracts that contain both a GMDB and a living benefit (e.g., GMIB, GMWB, GMAB), any increase (decrease) in mortality rates result in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value of MRBs.\n- (9) Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. A dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in the money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. For any given contract, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n- (10) The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contractholders with GMIBs or a lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible. The rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract's withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder. For any given contract, utilization rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n- (11) The withdrawal rate represents the percentage of account balance that any given policyholder will elect to withdraw from the contract each year. The withdrawal rate assumption varies by age and duration of the contract, and also by other factors such as benefit type. For any given contract, withdrawal rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs. For GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees. For GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value.\n- (12) Long-term equity volatilities represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatilities are available. For any given contract, long-term equity volatility rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n\n(13) Nonperformance risk spread varies by duration and by currency. For any given contract, multiple nonperformance risk spreads will apply, depending on the duration of the cash flow being discounted for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n\nAll other classes of securities classified within  Level 3, including those within Unit-linked and FVO securities, Other investments, Separate account assets, and Embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance, use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3 securities. G enerally, all other classes of assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 that are not included above use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table. The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the more significant assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are summarized in '- Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.'",

It also includes an in-force block of assumed variable annuity guarantees from a third party.\n\n## Financial Measure and Segment Accounting Policies\n\nAdjusted  earnings  is  used  by  the  Company's  CODM,  its  chief  ex ecutive  officer,  to  evaluate  performance  and  allocate  resources. Adjusted  earnings  and  related measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and related measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of the Company's performance relative to its business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.\n\nConsistent with  GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is the  Company's  GAAP measure of segment performance and is reported below.  The Company believes  the  presentation  of  adjusted  earnings  enhances  its  investors'  understanding  of  its  performance  by  highlighting  the  results  of  operations  and  the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\n\nAdjusted earnings focuses on the Company's primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of (i) market volatility which could distort trends, (ii) asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, (iii) revenues and costs related to divested businesses, and (iv) other adjustments.

          "chunk_text": "## THE GOLDM AN SACHS GROUP , IN C . AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for  extension  options  or  demand  features,  or  is  modeled  in  the  case  of revolving credit card loans.  The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse  economic  scenarios  over  a  three-year  period.  For  loans  with expected  lives  beyond  three  years,  the  model  reverts  to  historical  loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. We apply judgment in  weighting  individual  scenarios  each  quarter  based  on  a  variety  of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus,  recent  macroeconomic  conditions  and  industry  trends.  The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic  indicators  (e.g.,  unemployment  rates  and  GDP),  the borrower's  capacity  to  meet  its  financial  obligations,  the  borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The allowance for loan losses for wholesale  loans  that  do  not  share  similar  risk  characteristics,  such  as nonaccrual loans, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective rate, the observable market price  of  the  loan,  or,  in  the  case  of  collateral  dependent  loans,  the  fair value  of  the  collateral  less  estimated  costs  to  sell,  if  applicable.  Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.\n\nThe  allowance  for  credit  losses  also  includes  qualitative  components which  allow  management  to  reflect  the  uncertain  nature  of  economic forecasting,  capture  uncertainty  regarding  model  inputs,  and  account  for model imprecision and concentration risk. The qualitative factors considered by management include, among others, changes and trends in loan  portfolios,  uncertainties  associated  with  the  macroeconomic  and geopolitical  environments,  credit  concentrations,  changes  in  volume  and severity of past due and criticized loans, idiosyncratic events  and deterioration within an industry or region.\n\nOur  estimate  of  credit  losses  entails  judgment  about  collectability  at  the reporting  dates,  and  there  are  uncertainties  inherent  in  those  judgments. The  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  subject  to  a  governance  process  that involves senior management within Risk and Controllers. Personnel within Risk  are  responsible  for  forecasting  the  economic  variables  that  underlie the  economic  scenarios  that  are  used  in  the  modeling  of  expected  credit losses.  While  we  use  the  best  information  available  to  determine  this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among  other  things,  changes  in  the  economic  environment  or  variances between  actual  results  and  the  original  assumptions  used.  Loans  are charged  off  against  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  when  deemed  to  be uncollectible.\n\nWe  also  record  an  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  lending  commitments which  are  held  for  investment  that  are  accounted  for  at  amortized  cost. Such  allowance is determined using the same  methodology  as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of December 2024 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios)  to  the  expected  credit  losses  under  a  100%  weighted  adverse economic scenario. The adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects  a  global  recession  in  the  first  quarter  of  2025  through  the  first quarter of 2026, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. A 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would  have  resulted  in an approximate  $0.9  billion increase in  our allowance  for  credit  losses  as  of  December  2024.  This  hypothetical increase  does  not  take  into  consideration  any  potential  adjustments  to qualitative  reserves.  The  forecasts  of  macroeconomic  conditions  are inherently  uncertain  and  do  not  take  into  account  any  other  offsetting  or correlated  effects.  The  actual  credit  loss  in  an  adverse  macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nU.S.  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  certain  estimates  and  assumptions.  In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  loans  and  lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use  of  estimates  and  assumptions  is  also  important  in  determining  the accounting  for  goodwill  and  identifiable  intangible  assets,  provisions  for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes.",

The  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  wholesale  loans  and lending  commitments  that  exhibit  similar  risk  characteristics  is  measured using  a  modeled  approach.  These  models  determine  the  probability  of default  and  loss  given  default  based  on  various  risk  factors,  including internal credit ratings, industry default and  loss data, expected  life, macroeconomic  indicators,  the  borrower's  capacity  to  meet  its  financial obligations, the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending commitments, the methodology also considers the probability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans backed by real  estate,  risk  factors  include  the  loan-to-value  ratio,  debt  service  ratio and home price index.  The most significant inputs to the forecast model for  wholesale  loans  and  lending  commitments  include  unemployment rates,  GDP,  credit  spreads,  commercial  and  industrial  delinquency  rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk  characteristics,  such  as  nonaccrual  loans,  is  calculated  using  the present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  discounted  at  the  loan's effective rate,  the  observable  market  price  of  the  loan,  or,  in  the  case  of collateral  dependent  loans,  the  fair  value  of  the  collateral  less  estimated costs  to  sell,  if  applicable.  Wholesale  loans  are  charged  off  against  the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\n\nConsumer. The  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  consumer  loans  that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated using a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans into pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related characteristics that differentiate a pool's risk characteristics from other pools. The factors considered in determining a pool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used for internal credit  risk  measurement  and  management  and  include  key  metrics,  such as FICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic  indicators.  The  most  significant  inputs  to  the  forecast model  for  consumer  loans  include  unemployment  rates  and  delinquency rates.  The  expected  life  of  revolving  credit  card  loans  is  determined  by modeling expected future draws and the timing and amount of repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on credit card lending commitments  as  they are cancellable by the firm.\n\nCredit  card  loans  are  charged  off  when  they  are  180  days  past  due. Installment loans were charged off when they were 120 days past due.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses Rollforward\n\nThe  table  below  presents  information  about  the  allowance  for  credit losses.\n\n",

The  allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is  measured  using  a  modeled  approach.  These  models  determine  the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including  internal  credit  ratings,  industry  default  and  loss  data,  expected life  and  macroeconomic  indicators  (the  most  significant  to  the  forecast model  being  the  forecasted  U.S.  unemployment  and  U.S.  GDP  growth rates),  the  borrower's  capacity  to  meet  its  financial  obligations,  the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The  allowance  for  credit  losses  also  includes  qualitative  components which  allow  management  to  reflect  the  uncertain  nature  of  economic forecasting,  capture  uncertainty  regarding  model  inputs,  and  account  for model imprecision and concentration risk.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures  relating  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  wholesale loan  portfolio  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  the  significant  judgment  by management  when  developing  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the wholesale  loan  portfolio  using  a  modeled  approach,  (ii)  a  high  degree  of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence  related  to  management's  internal  credit  ratings,  forecasted  U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n130\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nAddressing  the  matter  involved  performing  procedures  and  evaluating audit  evidence  in  connection  with  forming  our  overall  opinion  on  the consolidated  financial  statements.  These  procedures  included  testing  the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, including controls over the determination of management's internal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting. These procedures also included, among  others, (i) testing management's  process for developing the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using  a  modeled  approach  (ii)  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of data  used  in  the  estimate,  and  (iii)  the  involvement  of  professionals  with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of the forecast model and methodology used by management  (b)  the  reasonableness of management's  internal credit ratings,  forecasted  U.S.  unemployment  and  U.S.  GDP  growth  rates,  and (c) the reasonableness of the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nNew York, New York February 26, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1922.",

      "answer": "The sale of substantially all of the Marcus loan portfolio in 2023 resulted in a $442 million reserve reduction in 2023, which directly lowered the 2024 provision for credit losses to $1.35 billion, compared to $1.03 billion in 2023. This reserve reduction contributed to improved financial performance by reducing the credit loss burden in 2024. Additionally, pre-tax earnings related to the Marcus loan portfolio were included in the Asset & Wealth Management segment, and its sale aligns with Goldman Sachs' strategic decision to narrow its focus on consumer-related activities. The strategic exit from Marcus reflects a broader shift away from consumer platforms, including the sale of PFM, GreenSky, and seller financing loans, reinforcing a corporate strategy to streamline operations and focus on core institutional businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "New business initiatives expose us to new and enhanced risks, including risks associated with  dealing with  governmental  entities, reputational concerns  arising  from  dealing  with  different  types  of  clients,  business partners, counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, market, sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns  with  the  manner  in  which  certain  assets  are  being  operated  or held or in which  we  interact  with  these  clients,  business  partners, counterparties and investors. Legal, regulatory and reputational risks may also  exist  in  connection  with  activities  and  transactions  involving  new products or markets where there is regulatory uncertainty or where there are  different  or  conflicting  regulations  depending  on  the  regulator  or  the jurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in such products may involve multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe  have  developed  and  pursued  new  business  and  strategic  initiatives, including acquisitions, and may continue to do so. If and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiatives, we  may  incur unanticipated  costs  and  losses,  and  face  other  adverse  consequences, such  as  negative  reputational  effects.  In  addition,  the  actual  effects  of pursuing those initiatives may differ, possibly materially, from the benefits that  we  expect  to  realize  from  them,  such  as  generating  additional revenues, achieving expense savings, reducing operational risk exposures or  using  capital  and  funding  more  efficiently.  Engaging  in  new  activities exposes  us  to  a  variety  of  risks,  including  that  we  may  be  unable  to successfully develop new, competitive, efficient and effective systems and processes, and hire and retain the necessary personnel. Due to our lack of historical  experience  with  unsecured  consumer  lending,  our  loan  loss assumptions may  prove  to be incorrect and we  may  incur losses significantly  above  those  which  we  originally  anticipated  in  entering  the business.\n\nIn  recent  years,  we  have  invested,  and  may  continue  to  invest,  more  in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues.  Such  investments  and  acquisitions  may  not  be  successful  or have returns similar to our other businesses.\n\n## We  may  not  be  able  to  fully  realize  the  expected  benefits  or synergies from acquisitions or other business initiatives in the time frames we expect, or at all.\n\nWe have engaged in selective  acquisitions  and  may  continue  to  do  so  in the future and these acquisitions may, individually or in the aggregate, be material  to  us.  Any  future  acquisitions  could  involve  the  issuance  of common stock and/or the payment of cash as consideration. The success of  our  acquisitions  will  depend,  in  part,  on  our  ability  to  integrate  the acquired  businesses  and  realize  anticipated  synergies,  cost  savings  and growth opportunities. For example, in 2024, we sold GreenSky Holdings, LLC,  which  we  had  previously  acquired,  and  in  connection  with  the disposition  we  incurred  a  write-down  of  intangible  assets  and  goodwill. Also  in  2024,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  transition  the  GM  credit card  program  to  another  issuer  and  have  incurred  a  write-down  of intangible assets in  connection with that transaction. In any future acquisitions, we may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, counterparties,  regulators  and  others  in  connection  with  acquisitions. Integration  of  acquired  businesses  is  time-consuming  and  could  disrupt our ongoing  businesses, produce  unforeseen  regulatory  or operating difficulties, cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial,  management  and  other  resources.  It  is  also  possible  that  an acquisition,  once  announced,  may  not  close  due  to  the  failure  to  satisfy applicable closing conditions, such as the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals.\n\nThere  is  no  assurance  that  any  of  our  acquisitions  will  be  successfully integrated  or  yield  all  of  the  expected  benefits  and  synergies  in  the  time frames  that  we  expect,  or  at  all.  If  we  are  not  able  to  integrate  our acquisitions successfully, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.",

      "question": "How did the sale of the GreenSky loan portfolio impact Goldman Sachs' credit loss provisioning and strategic realignment of consumer-related activities between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "The sale of the GreenSky loan portfolio had a measurable impact on Goldman Sachs' credit loss provisioning and reflected a broader strategic shift away from consumer-focused loan portfolios. In 2023, the firm recorded $637 million in reserve reductions tied to transferring the GreenSky portfolio to held for sale, which directly reduced the provision for credit losses. This strategic move was part of a broader realignment where Goldman Sachs sold the majority of the GreenSky loan portfolio in 2023 and completed the sale of the remaining $3.69 billion in 2024. These actions aligned with the firm's decision to narrow its focus on consumer-related activities, which also included the sale of the Marcus loan portfolio and the seller financing loan portfolio, signaling a deliberate exit from non-core consumer lending businesses.",

These PayPal and V enmo customers may, if provisioned for external transfers and subject to our sanctions and anti-money laundering controls, send PYUSD to external wallets not controlled by PayPal. The PYUSD Issuer may also allow institutional users to directly purchase PYUSD from the PYUSD Issuer (as per the PYUSD Issuer's stablecoin terms and conditions). The regulatory treatment of stablecoins is evolving and has drawn significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies around the world, including the SEC. There are uncertainties on how ongoing changes to federal, state, and international laws and regulations would apply to stablecoins in practice, and we and the PYUSD Issuer may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with any additional or changed requirement. If we or the PYUSD Issuer fail to comply with regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, penalties, and other consequences. In addition, we could face reputational harm through our relationship with the PYUSD Issuer if the PYUSD Issuer were to face regulatory scrutiny, PYUSD is deemed to be a security, or PYUSD is alleged to be used for transactions in connection with illicit or illegal activities.\n\nWe hold our customers' cryptocurrency assets through one or more third-party custodians. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodians, insufficient insurance coverage by a custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, a custodian's failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, a custodian's inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, the failure of the PYUSD Issuer to maintain sufficient reserve assets backing PYUSD and defaults on financial or performance obligations by a custodian, banks with which the  PYUSD  Issuer maintains reserve assets or counterparty financial institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and significantly harm our business, financial condition, and reputation.\n\nWe have selected custodian partners and the PYUSD Issuer, and may in the future select additional custodian partners and stablecoin issuing entities, that are subject  to  regulatory  oversight,  capital  requirements,  maintenance  of  audit  and  compliance  industry  certifications,  and  cybersecurity  procedures  and  policies. Nevertheless, any operational disruptions at any such custodian or issuer, or such custodians' or issuer's failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings (or reserve assets), could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce consumer confidence and materially impact our cryptocurrency product offerings and our operating results.\n\nCustodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of a custodian's bankruptcy. While other types of assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian's bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of a custodian's bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although we contractually require our custodians to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by a custodian, will be effective in preventing such assets from being treated as part of the custodian's estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers against a custodian's estate for our customers' cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.\n\n## Lending Regulation\n\nWe hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. Similarly, the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. may be subject to consumer credit legislation, licensing requirements, consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations. Increased global regulatory focus on shortterm installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products.\n\nConsumer Protection",

PayPal's interest-bearing installment product for consumers in G ermany is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations. These loans are originated by PayPal (Europe).\n\nPayPal and V enmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product are issued by an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S., and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.\n\nOur U.S. merchant lending products are subject to federal and state regulations and are offered by an independent chartered financial institution. Our merchant lending products offered in G ermany, France, and the Netherlands are subject to the laws of Luxembourg and certain local laws, and our merchant lending product offered in the U.K. is subject to U.K. regulation. The loans offered to European and U.K. merchants are originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., respectively. Our merchant lending product in Australia is subject to the laws of Australia and is originated by PayPal Credit Pty Limited.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau ('CFPB'). The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, we are subject to the direct supervisory authority of the CFPB. The  CFPB  and  similar  regulatory  agencies  in  other  jurisdictions  may  have  broad  consumer  protection  mandates  that  could  result  in  the  promulgation  and interpretation of rules and regulations that may materially impact our business.\n\nAnti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering ('AML') laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\nInterchange fees. Interchange fees (the transaction fees for processing credit and debit card transactions) are subject to regulation in certain jurisdictions.  For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions. Interchange fees are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.\n\nData protection and privacy. We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations ('privacy and data protection laws') relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, 'processing') of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants' customers, and employees ('personal data') in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are in the process of adopting or amending data protection and privacy legislation or regulation aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are subject to change and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs.\n\nAnti-corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.",

The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\n\nGovernment regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.\n\nPayments regulation. Various  laws  and  regulations  govern  the  payments  industry  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally.  In  the  U.S.,  PayPal,  Inc.  (a  wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only our PayPal-branded products and services, but also our V enmo, Hyperwallet, Xoom, and Zettle products and services, to the ex tent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions on the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal's service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or V enmo account. In the State of New Y ork, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state.\n\nOutside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those nonU.S.  entities  are,  or  may  be,  supervised  by  a  financial  regulatory  authority  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  they  operate. Among  other  regulatory  authorities,  the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF'), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People's Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not ex haustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.\n\nIn  addition,  financial  services  regulators  in  various  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.S.  and  the  European  Union  ('EU'),  have  implemented  payment  authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products.\n\nFinancial Services supervision . We serve our customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. ('PayPal (Europe)'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Lux embourg by the CSSF. We serve our customers in the U.K. through PayPal U.K. Limited ('PayPal U.K.'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution in the U.K. by the FCA. Accordingly, we must comply with rules and regulations applicable to electronic money institutions in the U.K. and credit institutions in the E.U., including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate  governance,  anti-money  laundering,  consumer  rights,  disclosure,  reporting,  and  inspection.  We  are,  or  may  be,  subject  to  financial  services-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial services industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and ex amination by the regulators of these partner financial institutions.\n\nLending regulation .  Our  U.S.  consumer  short-term,  interest-free,  installment  product  is  subject  to  federal  and  state  laws  governing  consumer  credit  and  debt collection, and PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender for this product. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation, but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal's consumer short-term, interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, G ermany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity.  Paidy,  Inc.  holds  multiple  licenses  for  the  issuance  of  its  consumer  installment  products  in  Japan  and  is  registered  with  the  Ministry  of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary.\n\n10",

      "question": "How does PayPal's full utilization of the Paidy Credit Agreement in 2024, as reflected in long-term debt, align with its broader liquidity strategy given the availability of its $5.0 billion revolving credit facility and the terms of the Paidy Credit Agreement?",
      "answer": "PayPal fully utilized the Paidy Credit Agreement in 2024, drawing down the full \u00a590.0 billion (approximately $574 million), which is now reflected in long-term debt. Despite this, PayPal maintained $5.0 billion in available borrowing capacity under its broader revolving credit facility, which remained undrawn as of December 31, 2024. This suggests that PayPal may have opted to use the Paidy Credit Agreement\u2014likely due to its favorable interest terms tied to the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (0.40% to 0.60%)\u2014for specific working capital or strategic purposes in Japan, rather than tapping into its larger, more flexible $5.0 billion facility. The Paidy Credit Agreement also includes financial covenants such as a consolidated leverage ratio, indicating that its use was strategically aligned with PayPal\u2019s broader debt management and regional operational goals.",

The negative impact in 2024 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the British pound and Euro. The positive impact in 2023 was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the British pound.\n\n## Available credit and debt\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the 'Credit Agreement') that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $600 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. As of December 31, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and as such, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\n\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the 'Paidy Credit Agreement') with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of \u00a560.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by \u00a530.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of \u00a590.0 billion (approximately $574 million as of December 31, 2024). In the year ended December 31, 2024, \u00a590.0 billion (approximately $574 million) was drawn down under the Paidy Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2024, no borrowing capacity was available under the Paidy Credit Agreement.\n\nWe maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with a borrowing capacity of approximately $80 million in the aggregate, where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\n\nIn May 2024, June 2023, May 2022, May 2020 and September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates (collectively referred to as the 'Notes'). Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments. As of December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of $10.6 billion in fix ed rate debt outstanding with varying maturity dates.\n\nFor additional information, see 'Note 12-Debt' to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\n45",

We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders and satisfaction of specified conditions, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $2.0 billion.  Subject  to  specific  conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the  Credit Agreement, provided  PayPal Holdings, Inc. guarantees the portion of borrowings made available and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024,  certain  subsidiaries  were  designated  as  additional  borrowers.

The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on June 7, 2028, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of the Company or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is ex tended upon the request of the Company, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

The weighted average interest rate on the borrowing was 7.92% as of December 31, 2023. We repaid $400  million  of  borrowings  due  to  bank  overdrafts  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2024.  The  total  interest  ex pense  and  fees  we  recorded  related  to  the borrowings were de minimis.\n\nWe also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, which had a borrowing capacity of approximately $80 million in the aggregate, as  of  December  31,  2024  and  2023.  This  available  credit  includes  facilities  where  we  can  withdraw  and  utilize  the  funds  at  our  discretion  for  general  corporate purposes. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\n\n## FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the future principal payments associated with our term debt were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does PayPal's improvement in the credit quality of U.S. interest-bearing installment loans reconcile with the decrease in allowance for credit losses in both the consumer and merchant portfolios, given the growth in loan balances and the broader context of credit loss trends in 2024?",
      "answer": "PayPal reported a decrease in the allowance for credit losses in both the consumer and merchant loan portfolios in 2024, despite growth in loan balances, which was primarily attributed to an improvement in the credit quality of U.S. interest-bearing installment loans and the PPBL merchant portfolio. Specifically, the consumer receivable portfolio's allowance for credit losses dropped from $380 million in 2023 to $348 million in 2024 due to improved credit quality of U.S. installment loans, even though there was growth in U.S. installment loans, U.K. revolving loans, and Japanese installment loans. Similarly, the merchant receivable portfolio's allowance for credit losses decreased from $160 million in 2023 to $113 million in 2024, driven by improved credit quality in the PPBL portfolio. Additionally, the overall credit losses in 2024 were partially offset by this improvement in loan credit quality, despite new loan originations increasing the risk exposure. This suggests that underwriting standards or risk assessments may have improved or that macroeconomic conditions favorably impacted borrower performance.",

(1)\n\nIncludes amounts related to foreign currency remeasurement. (2)\n\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2024 for our consumer receivable portfolio was $348 million, a decrease from $380 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in allowance for credit losses was related to the improvement in credit quality of interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S. offset by the growth of interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S., revolving loans in the U.K., and installment loans in Japan.\n\n## Merchant receivables\n\nWe offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through our PPWC and PPBL products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions  related  to  that  portfolio.  During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  we  purchased  approx imately  $1.8  billion  and  $1.7  billion  in  merchant receivables, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $53 million and $44 million, respectively. See 'Note 1Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' for additional information on this participation arrangement.\n\nThrough our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant's future payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been satisfied.\n\nThe interest or fee is fix ed at the time the loan or advance is ex tended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant's payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is a general requirement that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the repayment rate of the merchant's future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from 3  to 12 months.\n\n101",

Interest on these notes is payable on April 1 and October 1.\n\nThe notes issued from the May 2024, June 2023, May 2022, May 2020, and September 2019 debt issuances are senior unsecured obligations and are collectively referred to as the 'Notes.' Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears semiannually. We may redeem the Notes in whole, at any time, or in part (except for the June 2023 notes), from time to time, prior to maturity, at their redemption prices. Upon the occurrence of both a change of control of the Company and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating, we will be required to offer to repurchase each series of Notes at a price equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amounts, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are subject to covenants, including limitations on our ability to create liens on our assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and merge or consolidate with another entity, in each case subject to certain exceptions, limitations, and qualifications. Proceeds from the issuance  of  these  Notes  may  be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes,  which  may  include  funding  the  repayment  or  redemption  of  outstanding  debt,  share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments.\n\n103",

      "question": "How does PayPal's evolving valuation methodology for Loans and Interest Receivable, Held for Sale, including the shift to observable inputs in Q1 2024, align with the credit loss trends observed in 2023 and 2024 and the structural changes in the multi-year agreement with the global investment firm?",
      "answer": "PayPal transitioned the valuation methodology for Loans and Interest Receivable, Held for Sale to use observable inputs\u2014specifically, executed prices for comparable loans sold to the global investment firm\u2014starting in Q1 2024, which aligns with the firm\u2019s broader strategy to offload UK and European BNPL receivables under a multi-year agreement with that same firm. This agreement, initially signed in June 2023 and later amended in December 2024 to extend the commitment period to 2026 and increase the maximum loan balance that can be sold, supports PayPal\u2019s decision to shift toward more transparent and market-based valuation practices. Meanwhile, credit loss trends show a divergence: in 2024, losses were primarily driven by new loan originations but partially offset by improved credit quality, whereas 2023 saw losses increase due to both originations and deteriorating credit quality. This suggests that the shift in valuation methodology and the partnership with the global investment firm may have been strategic responses to both internal credit performance dynamics and the broader need for more liquid and transparent asset management.",

The price w as the significant unobservable input and w as determined based upon certain loan and risk classifications of the portfolio. Low , high and w eighted average prices w ere all $0.99, measured in relation to $1.00 par.

( 2)\n\nConsists of ROU lease assets recorded at fair value pursuant to impairment charges that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023. (3)\n\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2024, we measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale using observable inputs, such as the most recent executed prices for comparable loans sold to the global investment firm. Accordingly, loans and interest receivable, held for sale are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to 'Note 11-Loans and Interest Receivable' for additional information on loans and interest receivable, held for sale.\n\nWe measure the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable price changes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value based on valuation methods which only include significant inputs that are observable, such as the observable transaction price at the transaction date. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 when we estimate fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as when we remeasure due to impairment and use discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\n\nWe evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an ROU asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses on ROU lease assets related to office operating leases are calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data, and the impaired asset is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE\n\nOur financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, loans and interest receivable, net, certain customer accounts, notes receivable, and long-term debt related to borrowings on our credit facilities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. Our term debt (including  current  portion)  in  the  form  of  fix ed  rate  notes  had  a  carrying  value  of  approx imately  $10.5  billion  and  fair  value  of  approx imately  $9.8  billion  as  of December 31, 2024. Our term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate notes had a carrying value of approximately $10.6 billion and fair value of approximately $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. If these financial instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash would be classified as Level 1; restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, certain customer accounts, and term debt (including current portion) would be classified as Level 2; and the remaining financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## NOTE 10-DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\n## SUMMARY OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nOur primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not use any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n94",

Credit losses in the year ended December 31, 2023 were primarily attributable to loan originations during the period and a deterioration in the credit quality of loans outstanding.\n\n## Consumer loan portfolio\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell United Kingdom ('U.K.') and other European buy now, pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivables, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans over a 24month commitment period (collectively, 'eligible consumer installment receivables'). In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. For additional information, see 'Note 1-Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss ex ists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any portion of impairment not related to credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Accounts receivable, net\n\nAccounts receivable is primarily related to revenue earned from customers and is reduced by an allowance for credit losses. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses was not significant. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.\n\n## Loans and interest receivable, held for sale\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell United Kingdom ('U.K.') and other European buy now, pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivable and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans over a 24-month commitment period (together, 'eligible consumer installment receivables'). In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. Following the sale, the global investment firm becomes the owner of the eligible consumer installment receivables sold and we no longer hold an ownership interest in these receivables.\n\nThese sales  of  eligible  consumer  installment  receivables  to  the  global  investment  firm  are  accounted  for  as  a  true  sale  based  on  our  determination  that  these receivables met all the necessary criteria for such accounting including legal isolation for transferred assets, ability of the transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets without constraint, and the transfer of control, and thus, we no longer record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. We also concluded that our continuing involvement in the arrangement does not invalidate this determination. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of the consumer installment receivables sold and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets sold.\n\nPrior to the decision to sell, this portfolio was reported at outstanding principal balances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees, net of allowances for credit losses. At the time of reclassification of eligible consumer installment receivables to loans and interest receivable, held for sale in May 2023, any previously recorded allowance for credit losses for loans and interest receivable outstanding was reversed, resulting in a decrease in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 represents installment consumer receivables that we originated and intend to sell to the global investment firm. Loans and interest receivable, held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, determined on an aggregate basis, with valuation changes and any associated charge-offs recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Interest income on interest bearing held-for-sale loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.\n\nIf PayPal no longer intends to sell loans and interest receivable, held for sale, such loans would be reclassified to loans and interest receivable, held for investment. When a loan is reclassified to held for investment, any amounts previously recorded in order to measure the loan at the lower of cost or fair value are reversed on our consolidated statements of income (loss) (recognized within restructuring and other) and the loan is recorded consistent with loans held for investment.\n\n## Loans and interest receivable, net\n\nLoans and interest receivable, net represents consumer loans originated under our revolving credit products (PayPal Credit) and installment credit products and merchant receivables originated under our PayPal Working Capital ('PPWC') product and PayPal Business Loan ('PPBL') product.\n\n66",

      "question": "How does AIG's treatment of its financial exposure to AIGFP across its loan receivables, guarantees, and deconsolidation disclosures reflect both the historical risk and current mitigation strategies associated with this former subsidiary?",
      "answer": "AIG's exposure to AIGFP is reflected in three key ways across the sections: (1) A loan receivable of $37.6 billion from AIGFP is disclosed with a full allowance for credit losses recognized upon deconsolidation (page 134); (2) A $100 million guarantee related to AIGFP obligations is now recognized as a liability following deconsolidation (page 171); and (3) AIGFP was deconsolidated in December 2022 due to its Chapter 11 filing, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $114 million and its classification as an unconsolidated variable interest entity (page 102). Together, these disclosures show that while AIG has taken significant historical losses and credit risk on AIGFP, it has also implemented formal recognition and containment strategies post-deconsolidation.",

These commitments totaled $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## GUARANTEES\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nWe have issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of A IGFP and certain of its subsidiaries. We have also issued guarantees of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of A IG M arkets, Inc.\n\nDue to the deconsolidation of A IGFP and its subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2024, a $100 million guarantee related to the obligations of A IGFP and certain of its subsidiaries was recognized, and is reported in Other liabilities.\n\nWe continue to guarantee certain policyholder contracts issued by Corebridge subsidiaries as well as certain debt issued by Corebridge Life Holdings, Inc. (CRBGLH). Pursuant to the Separation A greement entered in by A IG and Corebridge on September 14, 2022, Corebridge must indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any liability  related to these guarantees. A lso, under a collateral agreement, in the event of: (i) a ratings downgrade of Corebridge or the guaranteed debt below specified levels or (ii) the failure by  CRBGLH to pay principal and interest on the guaranteed debt when due, Corebridge must collateralize an amount equal to the sum of: (i) 100 percent of the principal amount outstanding, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest and (iii) 100 percent of the net present value of scheduled interest payments through the maturity dates of the debt.\n\n## Business and Asset Dispositions\n\nWe are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with the completed sales of businesses and assets. The various arrangements may be triggered by, among other things, declines in asset values, the occurrence of specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, developments in litigation or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or are not applicable.\n\nWe are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under certain of these arrangements. Overall, we believe the likelihood that we will have to make any material payments related to completed sales under these arrangements is remote, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Other\n\n- For additional information on commitments and guarantees associated with VIEs, see Note 10.\n- For additional information on derivatives, see Note 11.\n\n170\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

Basis of Presentation\n\nOn September 4, 2023, AIG entered into an Adverse Development Cover Excess of Loss Agreement (the ADC Agreement) to hedge the risk of adverse development pertaining to V alidus Re's reserves with Clarendon National Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enstar Group Limited. Under the A DC A greement, A IG will be reimbursed up to $400 million of adverse development for all policies in force as of December 31, 2022 when paid losses exceed the baseline reserve balance of $3.043 billion. The premium expensed in connection with the A DC A greement was $80 million.\n\n## Global Personal Travel Business\n\nOn December 2, 2024, AIG concluded the sale of its global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business to Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich) for $600 million in cash plus additional earn-out consideration, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $511 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business is reported in Global Personal segment. A IG has also agreed to provide transition services to Zurich for 30 months after the transaction date.

(A IGFP), filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and filed a proposed plan of reorganization. The reorganization will not have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets of A IG or our respective businesses. A IGFP has no material operations or businesses and no employees. In conjunction with the bankruptcy filing, A IGFP and its consolidated subsidiaries were deconsolidated from the results of A IG, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, reported in Net gain (loss) on divestitures and other. In addition, A IGFP and its subsidiaries were determined to be an unconsolidated variable interest entity .\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GA A P requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions are considered our critical accounting estimates and are related to the determination of:\n\n- loss reserves;\n- reinsurance assets, including the allowance for credit losses and disputes;\n- allowance for credit losses on certain investments, primarily on loans and available for sale fixed maturity securities;\n- fair v alue measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- income taxes, in particular the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and establishment of provisions for uncertain tax positions; and\n- goodwill impairment.\n\nThese accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n101",

      "answer": "AIG's Derivative Liabilities, Net increased by $102 million for the year, driven primarily by equity contracts which saw a $151 million net inflow and interest rate contracts which contributed $51 million in net outflows. The overall net liability position of $453 million at year-end reflects a decrease from the beginning balance of $583 million. This change aligns with the $41 million in net unrealized gains included in income related to Level 3 derivative liabilities, indicating a partial offset to the liability increase.

      "question": "How does AIG's geographic segmentation of Political Risk Insurance in its U.S. and UK/Europe Special Risks offerings align with its broader Global Specialty product strategy, particularly in light of recent divestitures affecting its commercial lines footprint?",
      "answer": "AIG offers Political Risk Insurance as part of both its U.S. Special Risks and UK/Europe Special Risks portfolios, indicating a strategic geographic segmentation of this product. In the U.S., Political Risk Insurance is grouped with aerospace, environmental, trade credit, surety, and marine insurance, and has seen a shift toward non-admitted coverages that reflect a less severe customer profile (page_159). In the UK/Europe, the product is similarly bundled with aerospace, environmental, trade credit, surety, and marine insurance, but without mention of a similar shift in customer severity (page_164). Within the broader context of Commercial Lines, Political Risk Insurance is explicitly listed as part of Global Specialty products, which also include marine, energy-related property, aviation, trade credit, trade finance, and portfolio solutions (page_55). This alignment with Global Specialty underscores its role as a multinational offering, especially in light of the divestiture of CRS and Validus Re, which reshaped AIG\u2019s commercial lines presence and emphasized its strategic pivot toward core global specialty capabilities.",

      "question": "How does AIG's reliance on third-party investment managers, particularly in light of their lack of direct performance incentives, align with the company's exposure to market volatility in its concentrated investment portfolio and the forward-looking risks associated with equity market exposure to Corebridge Financial, Inc.?",
      "answer": "AIG outsources the management of the majority of its investment portfolio\u2014including liquid fixed income, private equity, and commercial real estate-related assets\u2014to third-party investment managers who are compensated based on the size of the portfolios they manage, not on performance, which creates a misalignment in incentives for maximizing returns. This portfolio includes significant concentrations in real estate-related investments and exposures to sectors like consumer discretionary and financial institutions, making it vulnerable to market downturns and credit spread fluctuations. Additionally, forward-looking disclosures highlight that AIG continues to have equity market exposure to Corebridge Financial, Inc., further amplifying its sensitivity to equity market volatility. If third-party managers underperform or fail to navigate these concentrated and volatile exposures effectively, AIG's investment returns, liquidity, and overall financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.",

M D&amp;A - Business Segment Operations - General Insurance - Business Strategy and - Industry and Economic Factors.\n\nLosses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties may materially and adversely affect the value of our investments, our profitability and sources of liquidity.\n\nWe are exposed to credit risk arising from exposures to various counterparties related to investments, derivatives, premiums receivable, certain businesses and reinsurance recoverables. These counterparties include, but are not limited to, issuers of fixed income and equity securities we hold, borrowers of loans we hold, customers, plan sponsors, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivatives instruments, reinsurers, corporate and governmental entities whose payments or performance we insure, joint venture partners, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses, custodians, brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, intra-group counterparties with respect to derivatives and other third parties, financial intermediaries and institutions and guarantors. These counterparties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, financial distress, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention and other reasons. In addition, for exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures, options as well as \"cleared\" over-thecounter derivatives, we are generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house and futures commission merchants through which we clear derivatives. Defaults by these counterparties on their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nAn insolvency of, or the appointment of a receiver to rehabilitate or liquidate, a significant competitor could negatively impact our business if such appointment were to impact consumer confidence in our products and services. Additionally, if the underlying assets supporting the structured securities we invest in are expected to default or actually default on their payment obligations, our securities may incur losses.\n\n## INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS\n\nOur investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy, and the performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our consolidated investment portfolio. For example, we have significant holdings of real estate and real estate-related investments, including residential mortgage- backed securities (both U.S. government-sponsored enterprise-issued and Non-Agency issued), and commercial mortgage-backed securities and whole loans. We also have significant exposures to domestic and global financial institutions certain industries, such as consumer discretionary and non-discretionary, the U.S. federal, state and local government issuers and authorities, and various governments globally. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect the valuation of our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. Our ability to sell assets in such segments may be limited.\n\nOur investments are also subject to market risks and uncertainties, including, in addition to interest rate risk, changes in the level of credit spreads, currency rates, and equity prices, each of which has affected and will continue to affect the value of investments in our investment portfolio as well as the performance of, and returns generated by, such investments. For information regarding risks associated with interest rate volatility, see M arket Conditions above.\n\nFurthermore, our alternative investment portfolio, which is subject to volatility in equity markets, includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through pre-tax income. A n economic downturn or decline in the capital markets has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our investment income, including as a result of decreases in the fair value of alternative investments.\n\nWe rely on investment management and advisory arrangements with third-party investment managers for the majority of our investment portfolio. The historical performance of any investment manager we engage should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our investment portfolio, our future results or any returns expected on our Common Stock.\n\nWe rely on external investment managers to manage the majority of our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income, certain private placement credit, certain private equity investments, commercial real estate-related equity investments and commercial mortgage loans.\n\nOur investment managers are generally compensated based on the size of the investment portfolios that they manage, rather than based on investment profits or income; as a result, these investment managers are not directly incentivized to maximize investment returns. Our investment portfolio's returns have benefited historically from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not currently exist and may not be repeated. There can be no guarantee that any investment manager we engage will be able to achieve any particular returns or generate investment opportunities with attractive, risk-adjusted returns for our investment portfolio in the future. If any  of our inv estment managers becomes unable to effectively manage our portfolio investments, the concentration of assets in our portfolio that are managed by it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\n18\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does AIG's geographic segmentation of Commercial Property Insurance in North America and UK/Europe align with its broader Global Specialty strategy, especially in light of recent divestitures impacting underwriting results?",
      "answer": "AIG structures its Commercial Property Insurance offerings across North America and UK/Europe, with both regions offering commercial and industrial property coverage, including business interruption and exposure to natural/manmade disasters. However, the U.S. segment notes an increasing proportion of non-admitted coverages, which has shifted the customer profile to be less severe in aggregate. Meanwhile, the UK/Europe segment includes similar offerings but is part of the broader International Commercial Lines, which also encompasses Talbot and Global Specialty. The Global Specialty business further integrates marine, aviation, political risk, and trade credit\u2014lines that are closely tied to property insurance in both regions. Notably, recent divestitures such as the sale of Validus Re (including Talbot Treaty reinsurance) to RenaissanceRe and the CRS crop business to American Financial Group have directly impacted the underwriting results previously included in General Insurance - North America Commercial. These exits suggest a strategic refocusing, aligning regional Commercial Property Insurance offerings more tightly with core capabilities and reducing complexity in global specialty lines.",

      "answer": "Schwab\u2019s broker-dealer subsidiaries, including CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc., are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which mandates a minimum net capital of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances or a minimum dollar requirement. As of December 31, 2023, these entities were operating under the alternative method, which also restricts dividend payments and repayment of subordinated debt if net capital would fall below 5% of aggregate debit balances or 120% of the minimum dollar requirement. This regulatory constraint is reiterated in both the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Broker-Dealer Regulation section, where the firm explicitly states that such capital thresholds limit its ability to make certain financial distributions. The MD&A section further defines the Uniform Net Capital Rule as a regulatory mechanism designed to ensure financial soundness and liquidity, reinforcing the firm\u2019s conservative capital management strategy.",

      "question": "How does the 2023 IDA Agreement impact Schwab's capital management strategy, fee revenue, and client cash allocation dynamics, given the constraints and commitments outlined in the agreement?",
      "answer": "The 2023 IDA Agreement impacts Schwab's capital management strategy by requiring the company to manage off-balance sheet cash swept to TD Depository Institutions, which influences how much capital is available for internal use or transfer (page_59). This affects Schwab\u2019s ability to respond to interest rate changes and manage profitability, as the agreement includes commitments to maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances, limiting flexibility (page_15). Additionally, Schwab earns a fixed monthly service fee of 15 basis points on client cash deposits held at TD Depository Institutions under the agreement, which directly affects fee revenue (page_5). However, this fee revenue may be less than the net interest revenue Schwab could earn if the deposits were held internally, especially when clients reallocate cash to higher-yielding alternatives, further complicating capital and income management (page_15).",

        "Hop 1: [SCHW](page_59) \u2192 [2023 IDA Agreement]: Schwab must manage off-balance sheet cash swept to TD Depository Institutions, affecting capital availability and internal capital transfers.",

      "question": "How does Schwab's use of the 2023 IDA agreement impact its capital management strategy, liquidity positioning, and revenue recognition framework, given the off-balance sheet treatment of client deposits, the amortization of contract assets, and the transition away from LIBOR?",
      "answer": "Schwab's 2023 IDA agreement supports its capital management strategy by enabling the company to sweep $0 in IDA balances off-balance sheet during 2023, preserving capital amid regulatory changes that include AOCI in capital calculations. From a liquidity perspective, the agreement aligns with Schwab's broader funding strategy, which relies heavily on client deposits and cash balances, with over 80% of bank deposits FDIC-insured. On the revenue side, the agreement creates contract assets that are amortized as a reduction to bank deposit account fee revenue over the contractual term, reflecting a long-term revenue impact. Additionally, the IDA agreement was transitioned from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, completing Schwab's LIBOR phaseout and ensuring continuity in its financial models and client agreements.",

        "Hop 1: [SCHW](page_61) \u2192 [IDA Agreement]: Schwab's capital management strategy includes migrating IDA balances off-balance sheet, with $0 moved in 2023 and $13.7 billion moved in 2022, helping maintain regulatory capital ratios including the adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 4.9% (CSC consolidated).",
        "Hop 2: [SCHW](page_96) \u2192 [IDA Agreement]: The IDA agreement creates contract assets amortized over the contractual term as a reduction to bank deposit account fee revenue, indicating a structured revenue impact tied to the agreement's execution.",
        "Hop 3: [SCHW](page_54) \u2192 [IDA Agreement]: Schwab transitioned the IDA agreement from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, aligning with its liquidity and funding strategy that relies on $34.8 million active brokerage accounts and over 80% FDIC-insured deposits."

      "question": "How has Schwab's exposure to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities evolved in terms of unrealized losses, fair value distribution across time horizons, and comparative positioning within its overall available-for-sale securities portfolio in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Schwab's exposure to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) showed minimal unrealized losses of $14 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $23 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in impairment (page_88). The fair value of this exposure was entirely concentrated in the 'after 10 years' maturity bucket at $109 million, suggesting a long-duration positioning (page_89). Within the broader available-for-sale securities portfolio, non-agency CMBS represented a very small portion\u2014just $109 million in fair value out of $107.6 billion total\u2014showing Schwab maintains a limited and specialized allocation to this asset class relative to its larger holdings in U.S. agency mortgage-backed and Treasury securities (page_87).",

      "question": "How has the valuation and risk profile of U.S. state and municipal securities in Schwab's available-for-sale portfolio evolved in 2023, considering both unrealized losses and maturity distribution, and what implications does this have for the company's liquidity and interest rate risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Schwab's U.S. state and municipal securities in the available-for-sale portfolio had a fair value of $579 million as of December 31, 2023, with gross unrealized losses of $55 million, down from $75 million in unrealized losses at the end of 2022. The maturity distribution shows that $71 million of these securities mature between 1 and 5 years, $396 million between 5 and 10 years, and $112 million beyond 10 years, indicating a concentration in intermediate to long-term maturities. Given this maturity structure and the current unrealized loss position, the portfolio reflects sensitivity to interest rate changes, which could impact liquidity and require additional risk mitigation strategies, especially if rates continue to rise.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of Class C Common Stock in voting rights, earnings per share calculations, and post-exchange offer structure collectively reflect its role and positioning within Visa's capital structure and shareholder governance framework?",
      "answer": "Class C Common Stock is positioned as a fully tradeable equity instrument without transfer restrictions, distinguishing it from Class B stock. It plays a role in dilutive EPS calculations through its as-converted treatment, indicating its economic equivalence to Class A shares. Additionally, Class C shares emerged from the Class B-1 exchange offer, where they were issued alongside Class B-2 shares, further integrating them into Visa\u2019s capital structure while maintaining differentiated governance rights, as Class C stockholders have limited voting rights tied to specific corporate actions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [V](page_90) \u2192 Class C Common Stock: Class C common stockholders have no voting rights except for specific corporate actions such as exiting the core payments business or amendments affecting their terms, and they vote either together with Class A or as a separate class depending on the matter.",
        "Hop 2: [V](page_91) \u2192 Class C Common Stock: Class C shares are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation on an as-converted basis, indicating their economic alignment with Class A common stock and their relevance in financial reporting metrics.",
        "Hop 3: [V](page_89) \u2192 Class C Common Stock: Following the Class B-1 exchange offer, Visa issued 48 million shares of Class C common stock, which carry no transfer restrictions, distinguishing them from the still-restricted Class B-2 shares and indicating a structural shift in Visa\u2019s equity composition."

      "answer": "Visa's accrual strategy for the U.S. Covered Litigation involves recording charges when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable, with the total accrual potentially differing from the escrow account balance. This uncertainty in accrual directly ties to the dilution mechanism affecting class B-1 and B-2 stock conversion rates, which adjusts downward when funds are deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account. The broader U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan encompasses these mechanisms, including the escrow agreement, stock conversion features, and indemnification obligations, to manage potential liabilities from litigation such as the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation.",

      "answer": "Visa's funding of the U.S. Litigation Escrow Account triggers a dilutive effect on class B-1 and B-2 common stock by reducing the conversion rate into class A common stock, effectively impacting earnings per share as if repurchasing class A shares. This dilution mechanism is tied directly to deposits made into the escrow account under the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan. In 2023, Visa deposited approximately $467 million into this account as part of the takedown payment from the 2012 Settlement Agreement, following a court-approved opt-out percentage from the settlement class. Despite the appellate court affirming the settlement, ongoing litigation such as the Injunctive Relief Class claims and the denial of preliminary approval for the 2024 settlement agreement introduce continued exposure, which may require further escrow deposits and additional dilution, as well as enforcement of indemnification obligations from Visa U.S.A.'s members if the escrow proves insufficient.",

      "question": "How does Visa's loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A. and its members, dated November 2, 2015, interact with the broader U.S. retrospective responsibility plan mechanisms and the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, particularly in terms of indemnification scope, liability allocation, and conditions for activation?",
      "answer": "Visa's Loss Sharing Agreement dated November 2, 2015, with Visa U.S.A. and its members (page_111) is a key component of the broader U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (page_72), which includes mechanisms like the litigation escrow agreement, class B stock conversion feature, and interchange judgment sharing agreement to address liabilities from U.S. covered litigation, particularly MDL 1720. The agreement specifies that each member bank's indemnification obligation is based on its membership proportion under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation (page_74). Additionally, the agreement was amended on October 22, 2015, to include opt-out litigation from MDL 1720 within its scope. In contrast, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan includes a separate UK Loss Sharing Agreement, where UK members agreed to compensate Visa for losses related to UK interchange fee litigation, up to the amount of up-front cash consideration they received, and only under certain conditions such as losses exceeding \u20ac1.0 billion or a reduction in the Series B preferred stock conversion rate (page_74). This shows a differentiated structure between the U.S. and Europe plans in terms of liability sharing, activation thresholds, and indemnification limits.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [V](page_111) \u2192 [Loss Sharing Agreement]: The Loss Sharing Agreement is listed as an 8-K filing dated November 2, 2015, among the UK Members, Visa Inc., and Visa Europe Limited, indicating its legal and regulatory significance.",
        "Hop 2: [V](page_72) \u2192 [Loss Sharing Agreement]: The agreement is part of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which includes escrow, stock conversion, and indemnification mechanisms to address U.S. covered litigation, including MDL 1720.",
        "Hop 3: [V](page_74) \u2192 [Loss Sharing Agreement]: The agreement was amended to include opt-out litigation from MDL 1720 and specifies that liability is allocated based on each member's proportion under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation. Separately, the UK Loss Sharing Agreement under the Europe plan has different conditions, including a \u20ac1.0 billion threshold and compensation capped at the amount received by UK members."

      "question": "What is the full picture of Class B-2 Common Stock's introduction and impact on earnings per share calculations, considering its absence prior to a specific stock exchange offer, its conversion terms, and its contribution to as-converted Class A common stock in fiscal 2023?",
      "answer": "The Class B-2 Common Stock was introduced as part of the Class B-1 common stock exchange offer, with no shares outstanding prior to this event. As of September 30, 2023, there were 120 million shares of Class B-2 common stock outstanding, which convert at a rate of 1.5430 into 186 million as-converted Class A common shares. This conversion significantly affects the diluted earnings per share calculation, as the assumed conversion of Class B-2 stock is included on an as-converted basis, contributing to the total of 1,983 million as-converted Class A shares used in the diluted EPS calculation.",

(MSMS), considering its classification as a consolidated subsidiary, its role in the broader joint venture with MUFG, and its inclusion among Morgan Stanley's significant regulated international subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley consolidates MSMS into its Institutional Securities segment due to its 51% voting interest, as noted in the business segment discussion. MSMS is part of a joint venture in Japan with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), where Morgan Stanley holds a 40% economic interest overall but consolidates MSMS specifically due to its majority voting control. Additionally, MSMS is listed among Morgan Stanley\u2019s significant regulated international subsidiaries in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, indicating its materiality and regulatory importance within the firm\u2019s global structure.",

      "question": "How does Morgan Stanley's systemic risk regime, particularly its liquidity and capital requirements, interact with its ability to manage credit rating downgrades and maintain subsidiary funding flexibility under current regulatory constraints?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's systemic risk regime imposes heightened liquidity and capital requirements that directly affect its ability to manage credit rating downgrades and maintain funding flexibility across subsidiaries. Under the regime, the firm must maintain unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net cash outflows over 30 days under stress scenarios and comply with single-counterparty credit limits of 15% and 25% of Tier 1 capital (page 7). These liquidity requirements align with the firm\u2019s exposure to incremental collateral or termination payments triggered by a credit rating downgrade, which could impair liquidity by requiring significant cash or securities outflows (page 18). Additionally, regulatory restrictions on subsidiaries, including 'ring-fencing' by non-U.S. regulators and limitations on transferring funds to the Parent Company, further constrain the firm\u2019s ability to reallocate capital freely, especially under stress scenarios (page 6). Together, these elements of the systemic risk regime create a complex interplay between regulatory capital obligations, liquidity stress testing, and the firm\u2019s structural funding constraints.",

      "question": "How does the increase in MS's employee loans from $4,120 million in 2022 to $4,349 million in 2023 align with the firm's credit risk exposure and recruitment strategy for Wealth Management representatives?",
      "answer": "The increase in employee loans from $4,120 million in 2022 to $4,349 million in 2023 indicates a growing financial commitment to employees, particularly in the Wealth Management segment, where such loans are granted primarily to recruit representatives. This trend aligns with the firm's broader credit risk exposure, as outlined in the credit risk section, which highlights that MS incurs credit risk through various lending activities, including employee loans. The firm manages this exposure through a comprehensive Credit Limits Framework that includes single-name limits and portfolio concentration limits, ensuring that credit risk remains within acceptable tolerances. Additionally, the ACL (Allowance for Credit Losses) for employee loans was $121 million in 2023, down from $139 million in 2022, suggesting that the firm's credit risk management approach remains adaptive to the changing loan portfolio. Together, these elements show that the growth in employee loans supports recruitment efforts while being managed within a structured risk framework.",

      "answer": "MS recognizes compensation expense for carried interest (both realized and unrealized) allocated to employees, as noted on page 140. This aligns with the Firm\u2019s broader deferred compensation planning, as outlined on page 2 under 'Deferred Compensation Plans and Carried Interest Compensation,' which indicates that carried interest compensation is part of long-term incentive structures. On page 96, the Firm clarifies that carried interest compensation is recognized over the vesting period and is tied to performance-based fees, which are further detailed under 'Revenue Recognition - Carried Interest.' This shows that MS integrates carried interest compensation into both its financial reporting and strategic compensation planning, with expense recognition occurring in alignment with vesting and performance triggers.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley complies with Clean Holding Company Requirements by maintaining external TLAC at or above the minimum thresholds\u201418% of total RWA or 7.5% of total leverage exposure\u2014and meeting the external LTD requirement, which is the greater of 6% of RWA plus the G-SIB surcharge or 4.5% of leverage exposure. The firm also operates under a 5.4% Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) effective from October 1, 2023, which contributes to an aggregate Standardized Approach CET1 ratio of 12.9%. This capital adequacy framework supports Morgan Stanley\u2019s SPOE (Single Point of Entry) resolution strategy, under which the Parent Company is expected to provide adequate capital and liquidity to subsidiaries to ensure orderly resolution in the event of failure. The integration of TLAC requirements, SCB, and SPOE planning reflects a coordinated regulatory and strategic approach to ensure loss-absorbency and operational continuity during financial stress.",

These requirements are designed to ensure recapitalization through loss-absorbing capacity in a resolution scenario.",

However, the company tracks and reports modifications and defaults for other types of loans, including consumer installment loans and small business lines of credit. Page 116 discusses the outstanding balances of modifications that remain in programs or have defaulted, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Page 117 provides data on modifications that defaulted within the reporting periods and were modified in the twelve months prior to default. Page 120 includes a table showing loans and receivables modified as TDRs that defaulted within twelve months, with a note that customers can miss up to three payments before being classified as in default. Together, these sections indicate that while interest rate reductions are not applicable to Card Member receivables, American Express maintains a structured approach to tracking and reporting loan modifications and defaults for other loan categories.",

      "question": "How does American Express's current policy of not offering payment term extensions for Card Member loans interact with historical default trends from loan modifications and the treatment of small business loan modifications to shape its overall credit risk profile?",
      "answer": "American Express maintains a consistent policy of not offering payment term extensions for Card Member loans, as explicitly stated in both the 2024 year-end disclosures (page 116) and the modifications-default table (page 117). However, the company does modify other types of loans, particularly consumer installment loans and small business lines of credit, as noted in the TDR default table (page 120). Historical data from page 120 shows that modifications on these non-Card Member loans have led to defaults within twelve months, with customers missing up to three payments before being classified as defaulted. This dynamic suggests that while American Express avoids term extensions for its core Card Member receivables, its credit risk profile is still influenced by modifications on small business and consumer loans, which have demonstrated a propensity to default. The interplay between a strict non-extension policy for card loans and the continued use of modification programs for other loan categories creates a layered credit risk exposure that must be managed carefully.",

      "answer": "American Express classifies a Card Member account as 90 days past billing if collection procedures are initiated before the account reaches that threshold, which affects how delinquency is reported (pages 64 and 61). However, due to system constraints, detailed delinquency data for periods less than 90 days is not available, limiting the granularity of risk management inputs (page 113). Additionally, the company accrues interest on these accounts until write-off, typically at 180 days past due, and establishes reserves for uncollectible interest, which reflects a forward-looking risk mitigation approach despite the data limitations (page 113).",

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nBilled business (Card Member spending) - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express.\n\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity - Capital Strategy' above for further related definitions under Basel III.\n\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\n\nCard Member loans - Represents balances on our credit card products and revolve-eligible balances on our charge card products.\n\nCard Member receivables - Represents balances on our charge card products that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date.\n\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out-ofstore spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\n\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each transaction on a charge card with no pre-set spending limit is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member's most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It , that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time. \u00ae\n\nCobrand cards - Represents cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner's own loyalty program.",

      "question": "How does PayPal's agreement with the global investment firm for the sale of consumer installment receivables impact both its financial exposure and strategic positioning, considering the indemnification terms, the scale of loan sales, and the accounting treatment of held-for-sale loans?",
      "answer": "PayPal's agreement with the global investment firm involves selling up to \u20ac40 billion in consumer installment receivables, with $5.5 billion sold in 2023 and $563 million remaining in the held-for-sale portfolio. While this agreement allows PayPal to offload credit risk and reduce balance sheet exposure, it also introduces potential indemnification liabilities tied to loan warranties, with a maximum exposure of $2.2 billion in outstanding balances sold. Despite this risk, PayPal notes that no significant indemnification costs have been incurred to date. Additionally, the held-for-sale loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes impacting restructuring and other expenses. This structured exit from a portion of its loan portfolio aligns with PayPal's broader risk management and capital efficiency strategy, while maintaining contingent liabilities that are not currently expected to materially affect financial condition.",

      "question": "What is the full financial and operational context of PayPal's crypto asset safeguarding liability, considering its custodial arrangements, risk concentrations, and fair value disclosures?",
      "answer": "PayPal's crypto asset safeguarding liability, which reflects its obligation to safeguard customer-held crypto assets, is recorded at $604 million as of December 31, 2023, and is matched by a corresponding safeguarding asset of the same value. This liability arises from PayPal allowing customers to buy, hold, and transact in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with custodial services provided by two third-party licensed trust companies. The use of only two custodians introduces concentration risk, as the failure of either could disrupt service and impact liability management. The liability and asset are measured at fair value using quoted prices from active exchanges, and as of the end of 2023, no loss events had occurred that would require adjustments to the recorded values. This fair value treatment aligns with PayPal's broader financial statement disclosures, where crypto-related assets and liabilities are categorized under Level 2 inputs, indicating reliance on observable market data rather than direct market quotes (Level 1).",

      "question": "How does PayPal's decision to hold a portion of its consumer installment receivables for sale, including the \u20ac40 billion agreement with a global investment firm, reconcile with the $563 million valuation of Loans and Interest Receivable, Held for Sale as of December 31, 2023, and the accounting treatment for credit losses and fair value adjustments?",
      "answer": "PayPal's decision to hold a portion of its consumer installment receivables for sale, primarily consisting of U.K. and European buy now, pay later loans, aligns with the $563 million valuation of Loans and Interest Receivable, Held for Sale as of December 31, 2023, as disclosed in the fair value hierarchy table. This portfolio was reclassified to held for sale in May 2023, and prior allowances for credit losses were reversed, impacting the consolidated income statement. The receivables are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes and charge-offs reflected in restructuring and other expenses, while interest income is accrued based on the contractual rate. The \u20ac40 billion multi-year agreement with a global investment firm includes a forward-flow arrangement for future loan originations, and the sale is accounted for as a true sale, removing the receivables from PayPal's consolidated financial statements, except for servicing rights.",

      "answer": "PayPal classifies its crypto safeguarding asset within 'prepaid expenses and other current assets' on the consolidated balance sheet, and its corresponding liability is recorded in 'accrued expenses and other current liabilities.' The asset and liability are valued using quoted prices from the principal exchange market for the underlying crypto assets, which is considered a Level 2 input due to the lack of active markets for these specific instruments. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the crypto safeguarding asset was $1.241 billion, matching the liability, indicating a balanced exposure. This valuation approach contrasts with more liquid instruments like marketable equity securities, which are valued using Level 1 inputs, and highlights the operational complexity of managing crypto assets compared to traditional financial instruments.",

      "question": "How does PayPal's financial exposure from its Seller Protection Programs, including the $64 million allowance for transaction losses, align with its strategic emphasis on these programs as a competitive differentiator for merchants?",
      "answer": "PayPal's Seller Protection Programs are framed as a key competitive differentiator in its merchant value proposition (page_9), where they are highlighted alongside analytics and risk management as tools that help merchants feel confident accepting digital payments. The financial statements (page_113) reveal that these programs are classified as assurance-type warranties, with PayPal reserving $64 million as of December 31, 2023, to cover potential losses from fraud and counterparty nonperformance. This financial exposure underscores the tangible commitment PayPal makes to stand behind its merchants, reinforcing the strategic positioning described in the business overview (page_10), where seller protection is explicitly listed as part of the expanded value proposition aimed at increasing merchant engagement and trust. The alignment between financial obligation and strategic emphasis shows PayPal is willing to absorb risk to maintain merchant confidence and drive platform adoption.",

      "answer": "Visa's U.S. litigation escrow account, which held $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2022, was used to address claims from the interchange multidistrict litigation (MDL), including a $850 million deposit in fiscal 2022. This reflects ongoing legal exposure despite the 2012 settlement being vacated in 2016 after the Second Circuit Court reversed class certification and remanded the case. As of 2022, the litigation remains active with new putative classes pursuing both monetary damages and injunctive relief, indicating that the escrow account continues to be a critical financial contingency mechanism for Visa in managing this long-standing litigation risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## VISA INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSeptember 30, 2022\n\n## Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization .  Visa  Inc.  (Visa  or  the  Company)  is  a  global  payments  technology  company  that  facilitates  global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world's largest  electronic  payments  network  -  VisaNet  -  which  provides  transaction  processing  services  (primarily authorization,  clearing  and  settlement).  The  Company  offers  products,  solutions  and  services  that  facilitate  secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients.\n\nConsolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  of  America  (U.S.  GAAP).  The  Company  consolidates  its  majority-owned  and  controlled  entities,  including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have  not  been  material  to  its  consolidated  financial  statements  as  of  and  for  the  periods  presented. All  significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia, impacting Visa and its clients. The extent and severity  of  the  sanctions  impacted  the  Company's  operations  and  a  reduction  in  Ruble  liquidity  impacted  the Company's  ability  to  manage  operational  impact  and  related  foreign  currency  risk.  In  March  2022,  the  Company suspended its operations in Russia. In addition, the Company deconsolidated its Russian subsidiary, resulting in a pretax loss of $35 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, which is included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services.\n\nUse of  estimates .  The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  GAAP  requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and  certain  highly  liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of  90  days  or  less  from  the  date  of  purchase.  Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company  defines  restricted  cash  and  restricted  cash  equivalents  as  cash  and  cash  equivalents  that  cannot  be withdrawn  or  used  for  general  operating  activities.  See Note  4-Cash,  Cash  Equivalents,  Restricted  Cash  and Restricted Cash Equivalents.\n\nRestricted  cash  equivalents-U.S.  litigation  escrow .  The  Company  maintains  an  escrow  account  from  which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The  escrow  funds  are  held  in  money  market  investments,  together  with  the  interest  earned,  less  applicable  taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nFair value. The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis.

Payments  settlement  due  to  and  from  our  financial  institution  clients  can  represent  a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2022, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. As of September 30, 2022, we held $9.2 billion of  our  total  available  liquidity  to  fund  daily  settlement  in  the  event  one  or  more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. See Note 12-Settlement  Guarantee  Management to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report .\n\nLitigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation  or  other  fines  imposed  in  investigations  and  proceedings, other than the U.S. covered litigation and VE territory covered litigation, which are covered by the U.S. and Europe retrospective responsibility plans, could give rise to future liquidity needs. During fiscal 2022, we deposited $850 million into  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  to  address  claims  associated  with  the  interchange  multidistrict  litigation.  The balance  of  this  account  as  of  September  30,  2022  was  $1.4  billion  and  is  reflected  as  restricted  cash  in  our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\nCommon stock repurchases. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $11.6 billion. As of September 30, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $5.2 billion.  In  October  2022,  our  board  of  directors  authorized  a  new  $12.0  billion  share  repurchase  program.  Share repurchases will be executed at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and our  financial  performance,  and  may  be  effected  through  accelerated  share  repurchase  programs,  open  market purchases  or  privately  negotiated  transactions,  including  through  Rule  10b5-1  plans.  See Note  15-Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\nDividends .  During  fiscal  2022,  we  declared  and  paid  $3.2  billion  in  dividends  to  holders  of  our  common  and preferred stock. On October 21, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $950 million in connection with this  dividend  on  December  1,  2022.  See Note  15-Stockholders'  Equity to  our  consolidated  financial  statements included  in Item  8-Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data of  this  report.  We  expect  to  continue  paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.\n\nCapital expenditures. During fiscal 2022, our capital expenditures increased. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure.\n\nSenior notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating to our senior notes of $22.9 billion. During fiscal 2022, we repaid $1.0 billion of principal upon maturity of certain senior notes. A principal payment on certain senior notes of $2.3 billion is due in December 2022, for which we have sufficient liquidity. As of September 30, 2022, we allocated $243 million to eligible green projects from the $500 million green bond issued as part of our commitment to environmental sustainability and a sustainable payments ecosystem. See Note 10-Debt to our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data of  this report.\n\nClient  incentives. As  of  September  30,  2022,  we  had  short-term  and  long-term  liabilities  recorded  on  the consolidated  balance  sheet  related  to  these  agreements  of  $6.1  billion  and  $0.2  billion,  respectively.  See Note  1Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\nUncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2022, we had long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.8 billion. See Note 19-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## U.S. Covered Litigation\n\n## Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Putative Class Actions\n\nBeginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or Mastercard, and in some cases, certain U.S. financial institutions. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Court) for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed amended and supplemental class complaints. The individual and class complaints generally challenged, among other things, Visa's and Mastercard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their 'no surcharge' and honor-all-cards rules, alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees, and Visa's  reorganization  and  IPO,  under  the  federal  antitrust  laws  and,  in  some  cases,  certain  state  unfair  competition laws. The complaints sought money damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and, in one instance, an order that the IPO be unwound.\n\nVisa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated, Mastercard International Incorporated, various U.S.  financial  institution  defendants,  and  the  class  plaintiffs  signed  a  settlement  agreement  (2012  Settlement Agreement) to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. Pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement, the Company deposited approximately  $4.0  billion  from  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  and  approximately  $500  million  attributable  to interchange  reductions  for  an  eight-month  period  into  court-authorized  settlement  accounts.  Visa  subsequently received  from  the  Court  and  deposited  into  the  Company's  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  'takedown  payments'  of approximately  $1.1  billion.  On  June  30,  2016,  the  U.S.  Court  of Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit  vacated  the  lower court's certification of the merchant class, reversed the approval of the settlement, and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings.\n\nOn remand, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of plaintiffs, a 'Damages Class' and an 'Injunctive Relief Class.' The plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class  subsequently  filed  a  Third  Consolidated  Amended  Class  Action  Complaint,  seeking  money  damages  and attorneys' fees, among other relief. A new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief  Class,  filed  a  class  action  complaint  against  Visa,  Mastercard,  and  certain  bank  defendants  seeking,  among other things, an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; against certain Visa operating rules relating to  merchants,  including  the  honor-all-cards  rule;  and  against  various  transaction  fees,  including  the  fixed  acquirer network fee, as well as attorneys' fees.",

      "question": "How does Visa's financial treatment of the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan in its litigation escrow account reconcile with the ongoing antitrust-related legal exposure under the plan and its separate handling of European retrospective liability?",
      "answer": "Visa has deposited $850 million under the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan into its litigation escrow account, which was previously used to fund a $600 million settlement payment as part of the Amended Settlement Agreement in the U.S. antitrust litigation. This contrasts with the treatment of the Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan, which does not use an escrow account and instead recovers losses through adjustments to conversion rates for preferred stock. Additionally, the U.S. plan continues to cover new claims, such as those from Old Jericho Enterprise and Camp Grounds Coffee, which are not released by prior settlements and remain subject to the plan\u2019s protections. This highlights a dual approach: the U.S. plan relies on a funded escrow mechanism to manage known and emerging liabilities, while the European plan defers financial recognition until losses are probable and estimable through equity adjustments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## VISA INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) September 30, 2022\n\nOn  September  17,  2018,  Visa,  Mastercard,  and  certain  U.S.  financial  institutions  reached  an  agreement  with plaintiffs  purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class to resolve all Damages Class claims (Amended Settlement  Agreement).  The  Amended  Settlement  Agreement  supersedes  the  2012  Settlement  Agreement  and includes, among other terms, a release from participating class members for liability arising out of conduct alleged by the Damages Class in the litigation, including claims that accrue no later than five years after the Amended Settlement Agreement  becomes  final.  Participating  class  members  will  not  release  injunctive  relief  claims  as  a  named representative or non-representative class member in the putative Injunctive Relief Class. The Amended Settlement Agreement  also  required  an  additional  settlement  payment  from  all  defendants  totaling  $900  million,  with  the Company's  share  of  $600  million  paid  from  the  Company's  litigation  escrow  account  established  pursuant  to  the Company's retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The additional  settlement  payment  was  added  to  the  approximately  $5.3  billion  previously  deposited  into  settlement accounts by the defendants pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement.\n\nFollowing  a  motion  by  the  Damages  Class  plaintiffs  for  final  approval  of  the Amended  Settlement Agreement, certain merchants in the proposed settlement class objected to the settlement and/or submitted requests to opt out of the  settlement  class.  On  December  13,  2019,  the  district  court  granted  final  approval  of  the  Amended  Settlement Agreement, which was subsequently appealed. Based on the percentage of class members (by payment volume) that opted out of the class, $700 million was returned to defendants. Visa's portion of the takedown payment, approximately $467 million, was deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account. On July 18, 2022, in response to an order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the district court certified its final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement as a partial final judgment.\n\nOn May 29, 2020, a complaint was filed by Old Jericho Enterprise, Inc. against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of gasoline retailers operating in 24 states and the District of Columbia. On April 28, 2021, a complaint was filed by Hayley Lanning and others, and on June 16, 2021, a complaint was filed by Camp Grounds Coffee and others, each against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of merchants located in 25 states and the District  of  Columbia  who have taken payment using the Square card acceptance service. Each of these complaints alleges violations of the antitrust laws of those jurisdictions and seeks recovery for plaintiffs as indirect purchasers. To the  extent  these  plaintiffs'  claims  are  not  released  by  the  Amended  Settlement Agreement,  Visa  believes  they  are covered by the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan.\n\nOn June 1, 2020, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served a motion for summary judgment regarding the claims in  the  Injunctive  Relief  Class  complaint.  The  putative  Injunctive  Relief  Class  plaintiffs  served  a  motion  for  partial summary judgment. On September 27, 2021, the district court certified without opt out rights an Injunctive Relief Class consisting  of  all  merchants  that  accept  Visa  or  Mastercard  credit  or  debit  cards  in  the  United  States  at  any  time between December 18, 2020 and entry of final judgment.\n\n## Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions\n\nSince May 2013, more than 50 cases have been filed in or removed to various federal district courts by hundreds of merchants generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. The cases name as  defendants  Visa  Inc.,  Visa  U.S.A.,  Visa  International,  Mastercard  Incorporated  and  Mastercard  International Incorporated,  although  some  also  include  certain  U.S.  financial  institutions  as  defendants.  A  number  of  the  cases include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit cardrelated market segments. Some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. In addition, some cases assert that Visa, Mastercard and/or their member banks conspired to  prevent  the  adoption  of  chip-and-PIN  authentication  in  the  U.S.  or  otherwise  circumvent  competition  in  the  debit market. Certain individual merchants have filed amended complaints to, among other things, add claims for injunctive relief and update claims for damages.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  cases  filed  by  individual  merchants,  Visa,  Mastercard,  and/or  certain  U.S.  financial  institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed complaints against certain merchants in the Eastern District of New York seeking, in part, a declaration that Visa's conduct did not violate federal or state antitrust laws.\n\nThe individual merchant actions described in this section have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, have been transferred, or are being considered for transfer by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for  inclusion  in  MDL  1720.  These  individual  merchant  actions  are  U.S.  covered  litigation  for  purposes  of  the  U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.",

Under the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, Visa is protected against 70% of liabilities related to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rate litigation, with losses recovered through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates of preferred stock. On June 21, 2022, as required by the deed, Visa conducted a release assessment and released $3.5 billion of the as-converted value from series B and C preferred stock, issuing 176,655 shares of series A preferred stock on July 29, 2022.

The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt-out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720  and  that  is  not  transferred  to  or  otherwise  included  in  MDL  1720.  On  the  same  date,  Visa  entered  into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well.\n\nOmnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with Mastercard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories' intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20Legal Matters. Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation  covered  by  the  omnibus  agreement  would  be  divided  into  a  Mastercard  portion  at  33.3333%  and  a  Visa portion at 66.6667%. In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions  of  the  Company's  U.S.  retrospective  responsibility  plan.  The  litigation  provision  on  the  consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement.\n\nOn August  26,  2014,  Visa  entered  into  an  amendment  to  the  omnibus  agreement.  The  omnibus  amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions  of  the  omnibus  agreement,  pursuant  to  which  the  monetary  portion  of  any  settlement  of  the  interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa  portion  at  66.6667%.  The  omnibus  amendment  also  provides  that  in  the  event  of  termination  of  the  class settlement agreement, Visa and Mastercard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and Mastercard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the settlement agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants.\n\n## Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan\n\nUK  loss  sharing  agreement. The  Company  has  entered  into  a  loss  sharing  agreement  with  Visa  Europe  and certain of Visa Europe's member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (UK LSA members). Each of the UK LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the  closing  of  the  Visa  Europe  acquisition  (Closing),  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  therein  and,  with respect to each UK LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such UK LSA member. The UK LSA members' obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess of the sterling equivalent on June 21, 2016 of \u20ac1.0 billion having arisen in UK covered claims (and such losses having reduced the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory.\n\nLitigation  management  deed. The  Company  has  entered  into  a  litigation  management  deed  with  Visa  Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory covered losses) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated  conversion  or  reduction  in  the  conversion  rate  of  the  shares  of  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock.  The litigation  management  deed  applies  only  to  VE  territory  covered  litigation  (and  resultant  losses  and  liabilities).  The litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with the litigation management committee for VE territory covered litigation (VE Territory Litigation Management Committee).

The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not  protect  the  Company  in  Europe  against  all  types  of  litigation  or  remedies  or  fines  imposed  in  competition  law enforcement proceedings, only the interchange litigation specifically covered by the plan's terms.\n\nUnlike  the  U.S.  retrospective  responsibility  plan,  the  Europe  retrospective  responsibility  plan  does  not  have  an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred  stock.  The  total  amount  of  protection  available  through  the  preferred  stock  component  of  the  Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at  any  point  in  time  as  the  product  of:  (a)  the  outstanding  number  of  shares  of  preferred  stock;  (b)  the  current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs  from  the  value  of  the  preferred  stock  recorded  within  stockholders'  equity  on  the  Company's  consolidated balance  sheets.  The  book  value  of  the  preferred  stock  reflects  its  historical  value  recorded  at  the  Closing  less  VE territory  covered  losses  recovered  through  a  reduction  of  the  applicable  conversion  rate.  The  book  value  does  not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa  Inc.  net  income  is  not  impacted  by  VE  territory  covered  losses  as  long  as  the  as-converted  value  of  the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records  a  reduction  to  stockholders'  equity,  which  represents  the  Company's  right  to  recover  such  losses  through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders' equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as 'right to recover for covered losses.'\n\nVE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than \u20ac20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in 'right to recover for covered losses' as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity.\n\nAs  required  by  the  litigation  management  deed,  on  June  21,  2022,  the  sixth  anniversary  of  the  Visa  Europe acquisition,  Visa,  in  consultation  with  the  VE  Territory  Litigation  Management  Committee,  carried  out  a  release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $3.5 billion of the as-converted value from its  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock  and  issued  176,655  shares  of  series A  preferred  stock  on  July  29,  2022  (Sixth Anniversary  Release).  Each  holder  of  a  share  of  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock  received  a  number  of  series  A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment divided by 100. The Company paid $3 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically converted  into  100  shares  of  class A  common  stock  in  connection  with  a  sale  to  a  person  eligible  to  hold  class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.

In contrast, the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, referenced on page 71, includes a broader set of mechanisms such as the litigation escrow agreement and indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A. members, which apply to U.S. covered litigation like the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL 1720). Page 116 lists the Loss Sharing Agreement dated November 2, 2015, among the UK members, Visa Inc., and Visa Europe Limited, indicating its formal incorporation into Visa\u2019s global liability framework. The UK agreement focuses on predefined thresholds tied to stock conversion impacts, while the U.S. plan employs escrow and indemnification structures to manage liability distribution across members.",

The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt-out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720  and  that  is  not  transferred  to  or  otherwise  included  in  MDL  1720.  On  the  same  date,  Visa  entered  into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well.\n\nOmnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with Mastercard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories' intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20Legal Matters. Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation  covered  by  the  omnibus  agreement  would  be  divided  into  a  Mastercard  portion  at  33.3333%  and  a  Visa portion at 66.6667%. In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions  of  the  Company's  U.S.  retrospective  responsibility  plan.  The  litigation  provision  on  the  consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement.\n\nOn August  26,  2014,  Visa  entered  into  an  amendment  to  the  omnibus  agreement.  The  omnibus  amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions  of  the  omnibus  agreement,  pursuant  to  which  the  monetary  portion  of  any  settlement  of  the  interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa  portion  at  66.6667%.  The  omnibus  amendment  also  provides  that  in  the  event  of  termination  of  the  class settlement agreement, Visa and Mastercard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and Mastercard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the settlement agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants.\n\n## Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan\n\nUK  loss  sharing  agreement. The  Company  has  entered  into  a  loss  sharing  agreement  with  Visa  Europe  and certain of Visa Europe's member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (UK LSA members). Each of the UK LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the  closing  of  the  Visa  Europe  acquisition  (Closing),  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  therein  and,  with respect to each UK LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such UK LSA member. The UK LSA members' obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess of the sterling equivalent on June 21, 2016 of \u20ac1.0 billion having arisen in UK covered claims (and such losses having reduced the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory.\n\nLitigation  management  deed. The  Company  has  entered  into  a  litigation  management  deed  with  Visa  Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory covered losses) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated  conversion  or  reduction  in  the  conversion  rate  of  the  shares  of  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock.  The litigation  management  deed  applies  only  to  VE  territory  covered  litigation  (and  resultant  losses  and  liabilities).  The litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with the litigation management committee for VE territory covered litigation (VE Territory Litigation Management Committee).

      "question": "How does Visa's Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan balance the financial exposure from VE territory covered litigation with the mechanisms for recovery through preferred stock, and how does this compare to the broader litigation and regulatory risks outlined in the company's risk factors?",
      "answer": "Visa's Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan addresses financial exposure from VE territory covered litigation by allowing the company to recover losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates of series B and C preferred stock, rather than using an escrow account like the U.S. plan. As of June 21, 2022, Visa released $3.5 billion in as-converted value from preferred stock as part of a scheduled release assessment, demonstrating a structured mechanism for managing these liabilities. However, the plan only covers 70% of liabilities related to specific interchange fee litigation where the issuer is outside the Visa Europe territory and the merchant is within it, leaving the company exposed to other types of litigation and regulatory actions. This contrasts with the broader litigation and regulatory risks outlined in the risk factors, which include potential disruptions, settlements, and compliance burdens from legal proceedings involving acquisitions and strategic investments, highlighting a nuanced exposure that combines defined financial mechanisms with more unpredictable external legal and regulatory pressures.",

The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not  protect  the  Company  in  Europe  against  all  types  of  litigation  or  remedies  or  fines  imposed  in  competition  law enforcement proceedings, only the interchange litigation specifically covered by the plan's terms.\n\nUnlike  the  U.S.  retrospective  responsibility  plan,  the  Europe  retrospective  responsibility  plan  does  not  have  an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred  stock.  The  total  amount  of  protection  available  through  the  preferred  stock  component  of  the  Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at  any  point  in  time  as  the  product  of:  (a)  the  outstanding  number  of  shares  of  preferred  stock;  (b)  the  current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs  from  the  value  of  the  preferred  stock  recorded  within  stockholders'  equity  on  the  Company's  consolidated balance  sheets.  The  book  value  of  the  preferred  stock  reflects  its  historical  value  recorded  at  the  Closing  less  VE territory  covered  losses  recovered  through  a  reduction  of  the  applicable  conversion  rate.  The  book  value  does  not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa  Inc.  net  income  is  not  impacted  by  VE  territory  covered  losses  as  long  as  the  as-converted  value  of  the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records  a  reduction  to  stockholders'  equity,  which  represents  the  Company's  right  to  recover  such  losses  through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders' equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as 'right to recover for covered losses.'\n\nVE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than \u20ac20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in 'right to recover for covered losses' as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity.\n\nAs  required  by  the  litigation  management  deed,  on  June  21,  2022,  the  sixth  anniversary  of  the  Visa  Europe acquisition,  Visa,  in  consultation  with  the  VE  Territory  Litigation  Management  Committee,  carried  out  a  release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $3.5 billion of the as-converted value from its  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock  and  issued  176,655  shares  of  series A  preferred  stock  on  July  29,  2022  (Sixth Anniversary  Release).  Each  holder  of  a  share  of  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock  received  a  number  of  series  A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment divided by 100. The Company paid $3 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically converted  into  100  shares  of  class A  common  stock  in  connection  with  a  sale  to  a  person  eligible  to  hold  class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.

The Uniform Net Capital Rule is formally defined in the glossary as Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifying capital adequacy standards for broker-dealers to maintain liquidity at all times (page_34).

Institutions are assigned one of four ratings ('outstanding,' 'satisfactory,' 'needs to improve,' or 'substantial noncompliance'). The failure of an institution to receive at least a 'satisfactory' rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions or opening branch offices.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve's long-held position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions, the so-called 'source of strength doctrine.' In effect, the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress.\n\n## Volcker Rule\n\nCSC and its subsidiaries are subject to the Volcker Rule, which generally prohibits proprietary trading or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to certain exemptions, in each case as the applicable terms are defined in the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations.\n\n## Broker-Dealer, FCM, FDM, and Investment Advisor Regulation\n\nOur principal broker-dealer subsidiaries, CS&amp;Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, are each registered as a broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission), the fifty states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. CS&amp;Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., CSIM, and certain of our other subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Charles Schwab Futures and Forex LLC (CSFF, formerly known as TD Ameritrade Futures &amp; Forex LLC) is registered as an FCM and FDM with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nMuch of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to SROs. Our principal broker-dealers are each members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). In addition, CS&amp;Co is a member of Nasdaq Stock Market, Cboe EDGX and MEMX, and TDAC is a member of NYSE Arca, Nasdaq Stock Market, Cboe EDGX and MEMX. In addition to the SEC, the primary regulators of our principal broker-dealers are FINRA and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The National Futures Association (NFA) is the primary regulator for CSFF's futures, commodities, and forex trading activities.\n\nThe principal purpose of regulating these entities is the protection of clients and securities markets. The regulations cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients' funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties, and the conduct of directors, officers, and employees.\n\nOur principal broker-dealer entities are subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer and it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule.\n\nThe Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits broker-dealers from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances or loans or repaying subordinated loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.\n\nIn addition to net capital requirements, as a self-clearing broker-dealer, CS&amp;Co, and as a clearing broker-dealer, TDAC, are subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses, such as the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation, which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients' trading activity and market volatility.",

      "answer": "The amended IDA agreement, which reduced service fees from 25 to 15 basis points on client cash deposits held at TD Depository Institutions, directly affects Schwab's capital management strategy by reducing the cost burden associated with client cash balances. This fee reduction likely supports Schwab's strategy to migrate more IDA balances onto its balance sheet, as evidenced by the $10.1 billion already moved by the end of 2021. However, despite this migration contributing to balance sheet growth, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for consolidated CSC and CSB declined to 6.2% in 2021, below Schwab's long-term operating objective. This suggests that while the fee reduction supports cost-efficient balance sheet expansion, the pace of capital recovery to meet strategic leverage targets remains sensitive to earnings, deposit growth, and capital deployment decisions.",

In 2021, the Company's issuances of preferred stock and strength in earnings helped to largely maintain our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, even as bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients grew by a total of $107.2 billion, or 23%, during the year. We ended 2021 with a consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 6.2%, down slightly from the prior year-end of 6.3%. Earnings in 2021 as well as capital contributions from CSC drove an increase in CSB's Tier 1 Leverage Ratio from 5.5% at year-end 2020 to 7.1% at year-end 2021. Though our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is below our long-term operating objective for consolidated CSC, this ratio is well above the regulatory minimum. The pace of return to our long-term operating objective over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the Company's balance sheet, earnings, and capital issuance and deployment.\n\n## IDA Agreement\n\nThrough December 31, 2021, Schwab had moved $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet, which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances.

The Company uses the market approach to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities. See Other securities owned at fair value above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\nNo new accounting standards that are material to the Company were adopted during the year ended December 31, 2021. There are currently no new accounting standards not yet adopted that are material to the Company.\n\n## 3.    Business Acquisitions\n\n## TD Ameritrade\n\nOn October 6, 2020 Schwab completed its previously announced acquisition of TD Ameritrade for $21.8 billion in stock. As a result of the acquisition, TDA Holding became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries,",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Unsatisfied performance obligations\n\nWe do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations other than those that are subject to an elective practical expedient under ASC 606. The practical expedient applies to and is elected for contracts where we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nSchwab considers all highly liquid investments that mature in three months or less from the time of acquisition and that are not segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, deposits with banks, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents also include balances that our banking subsidiaries maintain at the Federal Reserve.\n\n## Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes\n\nPursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations, Schwab maintains cash or qualified securities in segregated reserve accounts for the exclusive benefit of clients. Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes include resale agreements, which are collateralized by U.S. Government and agency securities. Resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions that are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. Under these resale agreements, the Company obtains collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned and the interest accrued. Collateral is valued daily by the Company, with additional collateral obtained to ensure full collateralization. Cash and investments segregated also include certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities. Certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings.\n\nSchwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions under ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326), in estimating an allowance for credit losses for resale agreements. This practical expedient can be applied for financial assets with collateral maintenance provisions requiring the borrower to continually adjust the amount of the collateral securing the financial assets as a result of fair value changes in the collateral. In accordance with the practical expedient, when the Company reasonably expects that borrowers (or counterparties, as applicable) will replenish the collateral as required, there is no expectation of credit losses when the collateral's fair value is greater than the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of collateral, then credit losses are estimated only on the unsecured portion.\n\n## Receivables from brokerage clients\n\nReceivables from brokerage clients include margin loans to securities brokerage clients and other trading receivables from clients. Margin loans are collateralized by client securities and are carried at the amount receivable, net of an allowance for credit losses. Collateral is required to be maintained at specified minimum levels at all times. The Company monitors margin levels and requires clients to provide additional collateral, or reduce margin positions, to meet minimum collateral requirements if the fair value of the collateral changes. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for margin loans. An allowance for credit losses on unsecured or partially secured receivables from brokerage clients is estimated based on the aging of those receivables. Unsecured balances due to confirmed fraud are reserved immediately. The Company's policy is to charge off any delinquent margin loans, including the accrued interest on such loans, no later than at 90 days past due. Accrued interest charged off is recognized as credit loss expense and is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Clients with margin loans have agreed to allow Schwab to pledge collateralized securities in accordance with federal regulations. The collateral is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Other securities owned at fair value\n\nOther securities owned are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. Unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. Client-held fractional shares are included in other securities owned for client positions for which off-balance sheet treatment pursuant to ASC 940 Financial Services -Brokers and Dealers is not applicable and the derecognition criteria in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing, are not met. These client-held fractional shares have related repurchase liabilities that are accounted for at fair value",

Corresponding repurchase liabilities in an equal amount for these client-held fractional shares are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. See also Notes 2 and 18. (1)\n\nIncludes LIHTC investments and certain other CRA-related investments (see Note 11). This item also includes investments in FHLB stock of $29 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which are required to be held as a condition of borrowing with the FHLB (see Note 13) and can only be sold to the issuer at its par value. Any cash dividends received from investments in FHLB stock are recognized as interest revenue in the consolidated statements of income. CSB and CSPB are members of the Federal Reserve and as a condition of membership, are required to hold Federal Reserve stock. Other investments also includes investments in FRB stock of $436 million and $191 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (2)\n\nRepresents substantially all receivables from contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606. Schwab does not have any other significant contract assets or contract liability balances as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. (3)\n\n## Capitalized contract costs\n\nCapitalized contract costs relate to incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, including sales commissions paid to employees for obtaining contracts with clients, and are presented in the table above. These costs are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over a period that is consistent with how the related revenue is recognized. Amortization expense related to capitalized contract costs was $69 million, $63 million, and $55 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, which was recorded in compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## 11.    Variable Interest Entities\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, all of Schwab's involvement with variable interest entities (VIEs) is through CSB's CRArelated investments and most of these are related to LIHTC investments. As part of CSB's community reinvestment initiatives, CSB invests in funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties and receives tax credits and other tax benefits for these investments. During 2021, 2020, and 2019, CSB recorded amortization of $71 million, $56 million, and $39 million, respectively, and recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $90 million, $69 million, and $47 million, respectively, associated with these investments. The amortization, as well as the tax credits and other tax benefits, are included in taxes on income.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe multi-period excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset and the relief from royalty method starts with a forecast of the royalties saved by the Company because it owns the asset. The withand-without method quantifies the difference between forecasted cash flows with the asset and without the asset. The forecasts are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the cash flow streams. The cost approach uses replacement cost as an indicator of fair value.\n\n## Low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments\n\nWe account for investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if the applicable requirements are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of taxes on income. The carrying value of LIHTC investments is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Unfunded commitments related to LIHTC investments are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company primarily has operating leases for corporate offices, branch locations, and server equipment and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has also elected to not record leases acquired in a business combination on the balance sheet if the remaining term as of the acquisition date is 12 months or less. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease liability may include payments that depend on a rate or index (such as the Consumer Price Index), measured using the rate or index at the commencement date. Payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date are considered variable. These payments are not recognized as part of the lease liability and are expensed in the period incurred. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amortization of finance lease ROU assets and the interest expense on finance lease liabilities are recognized over the lease term. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For the majority of our leases (real estate leases), the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We have not elected the practical expedient for equipment leases and account for lease and non-lease components separately for those classes of leases.",

      "answer": "Charles Schwab's exposure to U.S. state and municipal securities in 2021 totaled $1,687 million in fair value (amortized cost of $1,611 million), with $81 million in gross unrealized gains and only $5 million in gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2021. The maturity distribution shows minimal short-term exposure with only $23 million maturing within one year, while the majority ($1,514 million) matures beyond one year, split between $150 million in 1\u20135 years, $1,010 million in 5\u201310 years, and $504 million beyond 10 years. Additionally, the unrealized losses by duration show $4 million in fair value with losses less than 12 months and $1 million in losses lasting 12 months or longer, indicating minimal impairment risk in this segment of the portfolio.",

      "answer": "The disposal of Visa C shares elevated JPMorgan's Corporate VaR and Total VaR, particularly in Q2 2024, with a notable impact on average and maximum VaR metrics. In the same period, a portion of the Visa C shares was contributed to the JP Morgan Chase Foundation, reflecting a strategic philanthropy move. The overall transaction resulted in a $7.9 billion net gain recorded in Q2 2024, significantly boosting noninterest revenue and contributing to the firm's $58.5 billion net income for the year. This illustrates how the Visa C shares served both financial (gain realization and risk exposure) and strategic (philanthropy) roles, while also influencing risk management metrics.",

The increase was predominantly driv en by the impact of the Firm's receipt of Visa C shares on Corporate VaR and increases associated with credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments within Credit Portfolio VaR and AWM VaR, largely offset by market volatility rolling out of the one-year historical look-back period impacting the Fixed income risk type.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters.

Refer to Notes 6 and 34 for additional information.\n\nComparisons noted in the sections below  are for the full year of 2024 versus the full year of 2023, unless otherw ise specified.\n\n## Firmwide overview\n\nJPMorganChase reported net income of $58.5 billion for 2024, up 18%, earnings per share of $19.75, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 22%.\n\n- Total net revenue was $177.6 billion, up 12%, reflecting:\n- -Net interest income ('NII') of $92.6 billion, up 4%, driv en by the impact of balance sheet actions, primarily reinv estments in the inv estment securities portfolio, higher rev olv ing balances in Card Services, the timing impact of First Republic, higher wholesale deposit balances, and higher Markets net interest income, largely offset by deposit margin compression across the lines of business and lower average deposit balances in CCB. NII excluding Markets was $92.4 billion, up 3%.\n- -Noninterest revenue ('NIR') was $85.0 billion, up 23%, predominantly driv en by a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024, higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, higher inv estment banking fees, and lower net inv estment securities losses in Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe prior year included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion associated with First Republic.",

      "answer": "JPMorganChase's acquisition of First Republic Bank resulted in a final bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion, which was adjusted during the measurement period and included a $600 million gain expected in Q1 2025 after final settlement with the FDIC. The acquisition also included shared-loss agreements (CSLA and SFSLA), covering 80% of credit losses on certain commercial and residential loans, which were factored into the fair value of assets acquired. By December 31, 2024, JPMorganChase had substantially completed the integration of First Republic's operations, clients, and services, indicating strategic alignment and operational readiness. These elements together suggest that the acquisition had both immediate financial benefits and a structured risk-sharing mechanism, supporting long-term stability and integration success.",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 34 - Business combinations\n\nOn May 1, 2023, JPMorganChase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \"First Republic acquisition\") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC'), as receiv er. The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of the estimated fair v alue of the net assets acquired abov e the purchase price.\n\nThe Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair v alues as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair values required management to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and other v aluation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believ es that the fair v alue estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed prov ide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain.\n\nThe First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The final bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion reflects adjustments of $103 million and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, made during the one-year measurement period, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, to finalize management's fair v alue estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, 2024, certain matters related to the final settlement remained outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC.\n\nOn January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement with the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding items. As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a payment of $609 million to the FDIC on January 31, 2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, which will result in a gain of approximately $600 million to be recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIn connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement ('SFSLA'). The CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, ov er 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recov ery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7 years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in cooperativ e property constituting a primary residence. The indemnification assets, which represent the fair v alue of the CSLA and SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total assets acquired.\n\nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase issued a fiv e-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder.\n\nThe Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion of deposits prov ided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm's $5 billion deposit was effectiv ely settled as part of the acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $25 billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on May 9, 2023.",

The Firm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, was 12.3% as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRefer to Capital actions on page 105 for information on actions taken by the Firm's Board of Directors.\n\n## Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\n\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm's processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with superv isory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firm's ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm's Audit Committee is responsible for rev iewing and approv ing the capital planning framework.\n\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of alternativ e economic and business scenarios on the Firm's earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key driv ers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk ev ents. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key v ulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitiv ity analyses, as necessary.\n\n## Contingency Capital Plan\n\nThe Firm's Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm's approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and in stressed env ironments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital lev els and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at v arious lev els of capital depletion during a period of stress.\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nThe Federal Reserv e establishes capital requirements, including wellcapitalized standards, for the Firm as a consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm's principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.\n\n## Basel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally activ e U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensiv e approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach ('Basel III Standardized'), and an advanced approach ('Basel III Adv anced').\n\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is ev aluated against the lower of the Standardized or Adv anced approaches compared to their respectiv e regulatory capital ratio requirements.\n\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Adv anced approaches are that for Basel III Adv anced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitiv e approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on superv isory risk-weightings which v ary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is generally calculated consistently between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Firm's Basel III Standardized ratios riskbased ratios were more binding than the Basel III Adv anced risk-based ratios.\n\nAdditionally, Basel III requires that Adv anced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, calculate their SLRs.\n\nRefer to page 104 for additional information on SLR.",

      "answer": "Visa's accrual strategy for U.S. Covered Litigation involves setting aside funds in a litigation provision and escrow account when a loss is deemed probable and estimable (page 98). The total accrual may exceed or fall short of the escrow balance, indicating potential future adjustments. This directly affects the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan, under which deposits into the escrow account trigger a downward adjustment in the conversion rate of class B-1 and B-2 common stock to class A common stock (page 87), thereby diluting the value of those shares. From a financial flexibility standpoint, the company must balance its legal liabilities with shareholder equity structure, as the accrual and escrow funding decisions influence both income statement provisions and equity dilution (page 51). The interplay between these elements suggests that Visa's financial planning must account for both short-term liquidity needs and long-term shareholder value implications.",

We enter into long-term incentiv e agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for v arious programs  that  prov ide  cash  and  other  incentiv es  designed  to  increase  rev enue  by  growing  payments  v olume,  increasing  Visa  product  acceptance, encouraging merchant acceptance and use of Visa payment serv ices and driv ing innov ation. These incentiv es are primarily accounted for as reductions to net rev enue; howev er, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair v alue can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentiv es are recognized systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These estimates are regularly rev iewed and adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.\n\nAssumptions  and  judgment. Estimation  of  client  incentiv es  relies  on  forecasts  of  payments  and  transaction  v olume,  card  issuance  and  card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners.\n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. If  actual  performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentiv es may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentiv e payments are generally driv en by increased payments and transaction v olume, which driv e our net rev enue. As a result, in the ev ent incentiv e payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to hav e a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. T he cumulativ e impact of a rev ision in estimates is recorded in the period such rev isions become probable and estimable.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Matters\n\nCritical estimates. We are currently inv olv ed in v arious legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  Management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAssumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability  for  such  claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are inherently subjectiv e and based on a number of factors, including management's understanding of the legal or regulatory profile and the specifics of each proceeding, our history with similar matters, adv ice of internal and external legal counsel and management's best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes av ailable, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may rev ise our estimates.\n\nWe  have  entered  into  loss  sharing  agreements  that  reduce  our  potential  liability  under  certain  litigation.  Howev er,  our  U.S.  retrospectiv e responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the  U.S. cov ered litigation.  T he plan's mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. cov ered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan only cov ers Visa Europe territory cov ered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the cov ered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cov er any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter.  See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to  our  consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could hav e material adv erse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

      "answer": "Visa's ability to enforce and modify its operating rules is significantly constrained by a combination of regulatory oversight, litigation exposure, and binding settlement agreements. On the regulatory front, the Federal Reserve caps U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rates at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, directly limiting Visa\u2019s competitive flexibility in setting default interchange fees (page_20). This regulatory pressure is compounded by litigation risks, where adverse outcomes or settlements\u2014such as those involving antitrust claims\u2014can force Visa to alter its operating rules, pricing, or enforcement mechanisms, as noted in the litigation section (page_25). Further, the Injunctive Relief Settlement Agreement from March 2024 includes provisions that mandate reductions and caps on U.S. credit interchange rates and require modifications to Visa\u2019s rules, such as streamlining merchant surcharge requirements (page_100). Together, these three forces\u2014regulatory mandates, litigation outcomes, and binding settlements\u2014create a tightly constrained environment in which Visa must operate, limiting its autonomy in rule-setting and enforcement.",

Risk Factors\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\n## We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  ev olv ing  regulations  that  gov ern  our  operations.  See Item 1 -Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. T he impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules;  affect  our  existing  contractual  arrangements;  increase  our  compliance  costs;  and  require  us  to  make  our  technology  or  intellectual  property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner. As discussed in more detail below , we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing and localization requirements, currency conv ersion, point-of-sale transaction  rules  and  practices,  priv acy,  data  use  and  protection,  licensing  requirements,  and  associated  product  technology. As  a  result,  the  Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country, state to state, or by products. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and operational complexity, and reduces our rev enue opportunities.\n\nIf widely v arying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may hav e difficulty rapidly adjusting our products, serv ices, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply with the regulations. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of  regulations  and  laws,  such  as  regulations  regarding  anti-money  laundering,  anti-corruption,  competition,  money  transfer  serv ices,  priv acy,  and sanctions, and we continually adjust our compliance programs as regulations ev olv e. Howev er, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the ev ent our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civ il and criminal penalties, litigation, inv estigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the ev olv ing and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negativ ely impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the v olume of payments we process, our net rev enue, our brands, our competitiv e positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and serv ices, the quality and types of products and serv ices we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business and financial results.\n\nIncreased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.\n\nRegulators around the world hav e been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate v arious aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1Government Regulation for more information . In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we hav e historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receiv e any rev enue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the rev erse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees  are  a  factor  on  which  we  compete  with  other  payments  prov iders  and  are  therefore  an  important  determinant  of  the  v olume  of  transactions  we process.  Consequently,  changes  to  these  fees,  whether  v oluntarily  or  by  mandate,  can  substantially  affect  our  ov erall  payments  v olumes  and  net rev enue.\n\nInterchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased gov ernment regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions hav e rev iewed or are rev iewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example:\n\n- Regulations  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserv e  cap  the  maximum  U.S.  debit  interchange  reimbursement  rate  receiv ed  by  large  financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act limits issuers' and payment networks' ability to adopt network exclusiv ity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business.  In  response  to  merchant  requests,  the  Federal  Reserv e  has  recently  taken  actions  to  rev isit  its  regulations  that  implement  these aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, in October 2022, the Federal Reserv e published a final rule effectiv ely requiring issuers to ensure that at least two unaffiliated networks",

In the ev ent we are found liable or reach a settlement in any action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit, such as one inv olv ing an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the U.S., or we incur liability arising from a gov ernment inv estigation, we may be required to pay significant awards or judgments, settlements, costs or fines. In addition, settlement terms, judgments, orders, pressures or ev ents in or resulting from actions hav e impacted and may continue to impact our business by creating uncertainty for our business or by influencing or requiring us to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. These actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators, inv estigators, gov ernments or civ il litigants in the same or other jurisdictions,  which  may  lead  to  additional  actions  against  Visa.  Finally,  we  are  required  by  some  of  our  commercial  agreements  to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, ev en if Visa is not a defendant.\n\nFor  certain  actions  like  those  that  are  U.S.  cov ered  litigation  or  VE  territory  cov ered  litigation,  as  described  in Note  5-U.S.  and  Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, we hav e certain financial protections pursuant to the respectiv e retrospectiv e responsibility plans. The two retrospectiv e responsibility plans are different in the protections they prov ide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of the retrospectiv e responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or ev en cause us to become insolvent.\n\n## Business Risks\n\n## We face intense competition in our industry.\n\nThe global payments space is intensely competitiv e. As technology ev olv es and consumer expectations change, new competitors or methods of payment emerge, and existing clients and competitors assume different roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic payments, v irtual currency  payments,  global  or  multi-regional  networks,  other  domestic  and  closed-loop  payments  systems,  digital  wallets  and  alternativ e  payments prov iders primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, other emerging payment prov iders such as fintechs, other digital payments, technology companies that have developed payments systems",

The additional settlement payment was added to the approximately $5.3 billion prev iously deposited into settlement accounts by the defendants pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement.\n\nCertain merchants in the proposed settlement class objected to the settlement and/or submitted requests to opt out of the settlement class. On December 13, 2019, the district court granted final approv al of the Amended Settlement Agreement, which was subsequently appealed. Based on the percentage of class members (by payment v olume) that opted out of the class, $700 million was returned to defendants. Visa's portion of the takedown payment, approximately $467 million, was deposited into the  U.S. litigation escrow account.  On  March 15, 2023, the  U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the final approv al of the Amended Settlement Agreement by the district court. On August 3, 2023, the district court entered an order appointing a special master to resolv e matters arising out of or relating to the Amended Settlement Agreement's plan of administration.\n\nIndirect Purchaser Claims. Three complaints hav e been filed against Visa and other defendants asserting v iolations of certain state antitrust laws and seeking recov ery as indirect purchasers. A complaint was filed by Old Jericho Enterprise, Inc. on May 29, 2020, against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of gasoline retailers operating in 24 states and the District of Columbia. Two separate complaints were subsequently filed in 2021 against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of merchants located in 25 states and the District of Columbia who hav e taken payment using the Square card acceptance serv ice - one by Hayley Lanning and others on April 28 and one by Camp Grounds Coffee and others on June 16. Plaintiffs  in  all three  actions  subsequently  serv ed  motions  for  partial  summary  judgment.  T hereafter,  in  May  and  September  2024,  the  district  court denied motions for partial summary judgment filed by the Lanning and Camp Grounds plaintiffs and the Old Jericho plaintiffs, which all three  plaintiff groups  hav e  now  appealed. T o  the  extent  these  plaintiffs'  claims  are  not  released  by  the Amended  Settlement Agreement,  Visa  believ es  they  are covered by the U.S. Retrospectiv e Responsibility Plan.\n\nInjunctive  Relief  Class. Following  remand from the  U.S.  Court of Appeals for the  Second  Circuit and the appointment of  Injunctiv e  Relief  Class counsel, on September 27, 2021, the district court certified without opt out rights an Injunctiv e Relief Class consisting of all merchants that accept Visa or Mastercard credit or debit cards in the United States at any time between December 18, 2020 and entry of final judgment.\n\nFrom January through April, 2024, the district court issued rulings on v arious summary judgment motions. The district court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion for summary judgment under Ohio v. American Express, denied defendants' motions for summary judgment based on the post-IPO conspiracy claims, and granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on Injunctiv e Relief Class plaintiffs' monopolization claims. The district court denied the Injunctiv e Relief Class plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment.\n\nOn March 25, 2024,  Visa and  Mastercard entered into an agreement to resolv e the  Injunctiv e  Relief  Class  claims  (Injunctiv e  Relief  Settlement Agreement), subject to court approv al. The Injunctiv e Relief Settlement Agreement included, among other terms, (i) a release from class members for claims for declaratory, injunctiv e or equitable relief arising out of conduct alleged by the Injunctiv e Relief Class in the litigation that hav e accrued or may accrue in the future during the term of the Injunctiv e Relief Settlement Agreement; (ii) prov isions requiring reductions and caps on U.S. credit interchange rates; and (iii) prov isions requiring modifications to the Company's rules in the U.S. that, among other things, streamline requirements for merchants who wish to impose a surcharge on credit transactions. On March 26, 2024, the Injunctiv e Relief Class plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approv al of the settlement, which was denied on June 25, 2024.\n\n## Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (M DL) - Individual M erchant Actions\n\nSince May 2013, more than 50 cases have been filed in or remov ed to v arious federal district courts by hundreds of merchants generally pursuing damages  claims  on  allegations  similar  to  those  raised  in  MDL  1720.  T he  cases  name  as  defendants  Visa  Inc.,  Visa  U.S.A.,  Visa  International, Mastercard  Incorporated  and  Mastercard  International  Incorporated,  although  some  also  include  certain  U.S.  financial  institutions  as  defendants. A number of the cases include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments. Some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including  the  honor-all-cards  rule;  and  v arious  transaction  fees,  including  the  fixed  acquirer  network  fee.  In  addition,  some  cases  assert  that  Visa, Mastercard and/or their member banks conspired to prev ent the adoption of chip-and-PIN authentication in the U.S. or otherwise circumv ent competition in the debit market. Certain indiv idual merchants hav e filed amended complaints to, among other things, add claims for injunctiv e relief and update claims for damages.",

      "answer": "Visa's funding of the U.S. Litigation Escrow Account impacts its capital structure by diluting the conversion rate of class B-1 and B-2 common stock to class A common stock, effectively reducing the as-converted share count similar to a stock repurchase. This dilution mechanism is triggered with each deposit into the escrow account, as seen with the $1.5 billion deposited in fiscal 2024. Simultaneously, the escrow balance of $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, represents restricted cash that Visa cannot use for operational purposes, thereby affecting its liquidity position by reducing available working capital.",

Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the v alue of the Company's class B-1 and B-2 common stock is subject to dilution through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of class B-1 and B-2 common stock ultimately convert  into  shares  of  class A  common  stock.  T his  has  the  same  economic  effect  on  earnings  per  share  as  repurchasing  the  Company's  class A common stock, because it reduces the class  B conversion rate and consequently the as-conv erted class A common stock share count with each deposit amount. See Note 15-Stockholders' Equity .\n\nMakewhole agreements. As a condition to participating in the class B-1 common stock exchange offer, each participating stockholder, together with its respectiv e parent guarantors (as applicable), entered into a separate makewhole agreement with Visa pursuant to which the holder agreed to reimburse  Visa in cash for the portion of certain future  deposits  into  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  that,  but  for  the  holder's  participation  in  the exchange offer, would hav e been absorbed by such holder through a reduction in the class B-1 conv ersion rate in respect of the class B-1 common stock it  tendered  in  the  exchange  offer .  Payments  under  the  makewhole  agreements  arise  when,  as  a  result  of  a  deposit  into  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow account, the as-conv erted v alue of the class B-2 common stock a holder receiv ed in the exchange offer becomes or is already less than zero, but the class B-1 conv ersion rate remains greater than or equal to zero. No additional payment obligations will arise under the makewhole agreements after the class B-1 conv ersion rate reaches zero. See Note 15-Stockholders' Equity .\n\nIndemnification obligations . T o the extent that amounts av ailable under the U.S. litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolv e the U.S. cov ered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.'s members for such excess amounts, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements.\n\nInterchange  judgment  sharing  agreement. Visa  U.S.A.  and  Visa  International  Serv ice  Association  (Visa  International)  hav e  entered  into  an interchange  judgment  sharing  agreement  with  certain  Visa  U.S.A.  members  that  hav e  been  named  as  defendants  in  the  interchange  multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 20-Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of Mastercard.",

See Note 10-Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nU.S. Litigation escrow  account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospectiv e responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common stockholders from financial liability  for  certain  litigation  cases,  we  maintain  a  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  from  which  monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. cov ered litigation will be payable. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. cov ered litigation matters, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\n## Uses of Liquidity\n\nPayments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receiv able or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the  U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions.  In general, during fiscal 2024, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. As of September 30, 2024, we held $11.2 billion of our total available liquidity to fund daily settlement in the ev ent one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity available  to  support  our  working  capital  and  other  liquidity  needs.  See Note  12-Settlement  Guarantee  Management to  our  consolidated  financial statements included in Item 8 of this report .\n\nLitigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation  or  other  fines  imposed  in  inv estigations  and  proceedings  could  giv e  rise  to  future  liquidity needs.  During  fiscal  2024,  we  deposited  $1.5  billion  into  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  to  address  claims  associated  with  the  interchange multidistrict litigation.  T he balance of this account as of  September 30, 2024 was $3.1 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nCommon stock repurchases. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $17.0 billion. As of September 30, 2024, our share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $13.1 billion. Share repurchases will be executed at prices we deem appropriate subject to v arious factors, including market conditions and our financial performance, and may be effected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or priv ately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. See Note  15-Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nDividends . During fiscal 2024, we declared and paid $4.2 billion in div idends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On October 29, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash div idend of $0.59 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of all other outstanding common and preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to continue paying quarterly div idends in cash, subject to approv al by the board of directors. See Note 15-Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nAcquisitions. In September 2024, we entered into a definitiv e agreement to acquire Featurespace. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approv als. In  January 2024, we acquired Pismo for a purchase consideration of $929 million. See Note  2Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nSenior notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating to our senior notes of $21.1 billion. Since the issuance of the $500 million green bond as part of our commitment to env ironmental sustainability and a sustainable payments ecosystem, we hav e allocated all proceeds to eligible green projects. See Note 10-Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nClient incentives. As of  September 30, 2024, we had short-term and long-term liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these agreements of $9.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectiv ely.\n\nUncertain  tax  positions. As of September 30, 2024, we had long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.3 billion.

In the U.S., the loss sharing agreement works in tandem with the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement to allocate liability for interchange fee litigation, such as MDL 1720, with Visa bearing 66.6667% of any monetary settlements or judgments. The omnibus agreement also extends to opt-out litigation cases that arise from MDL 1720. In the UK, the loss sharing agreement involves Visa Europe and UK financial institution members, where each member agrees to compensate Visa up to the amount of up-front cash consideration they received, contingent on losses exceeding \u20ac1.0 billion or a reduction in the Series B preferred stock conversion rate. These agreements collectively structure Visa\u2019s indemnification exposure across jurisdictions, with the U.S. plan relying on a litigation escrow, stock conversion features, and member indemnities, while the UK plan is capped by member-specific limits and tied to litigation outcomes in the UK related to domestic interchange fees prior to the Visa Europe acquisition.",

The loss sharing agreement prov ides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount  of  a  final  judgment  paid  by  Visa  U.S.A.  or  Visa  International  in  the  U.S.  cov ered  litigation  after  the  operation  of  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow arrangement, conv ersion feature of the Company's class B common stock and interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a U.S. cov ered litigation that is approv ed as required under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation by the v ote of Visa U.S.A.'s specified v oting members. T he sev eral obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approv ed settlement of a U.S. cov ered litigation, multiplied by such bank's then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation.\n\nOn October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. cov ered litigation  any  action  brought  after  the  amendment  by  an  opt-out  from  the  Rule  23(b)(3)  Settlement  Class  in  MDL  1720  that  arises  out  of  facts  or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well.\n\nOmnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with Mastercard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories' intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20-Legal Matters. Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation cov ered by the omnibus agreement would be div ided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%.  In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would hav e no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be div ided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified prov isions of the Company's U.S. retrospectiv e responsibility plan. The litigation prov ision on the consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement.\n\nOn  August  26,  2014,  Visa  entered  into  an  amendment  to  the  omnibus  agreement.  The  omnibus  amendment  makes  applicable  to  certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing prov isions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion  of  any  settlement  of  the  interchange  multidistrict  litigation  cov ered  by  the  omnibus  agreement  would  be  div ided  into  a  Mastercard portion  at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The omnibus amendment also prov ides that in the ev ent of termination of the class settlement agreement, Visa and Mastercard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall hav e receiv ed two-thirds and Mastercard shall hav e receiv ed  one-third  of  the  total  of  (i)  the  sums  paid  to  defendants  as  a  result  of  the  termination  of  the  settlement  agreement  and  (ii)  the  takedown payments previously made to defendants.\n\n## Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan\n\nUK loss sharing agreement. T he  Company has entered into a loss sharing agreement with  Visa  Europe and certain of  Visa  Europe's member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (UK LSA members). Each of the UK LSA members has agreed, on a sev eral and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the closing of the  Visa  Europe  acquisition  (Closing),  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  therein  and,  with  respect  to  each  UK  LSA  member,  up  to  a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration receiv ed by such UK LSA member. The UK LSA members' obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses v alued in excess of the sterling equiv alent on June 21, 2016 of \u20ac1.0 billion hav ing arisen in UK cov ered claims (and such losses hav ing reduced the conv ersion rate of the series B preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conv ersion rate of the series B preferred stock hav ing been reduced to",

Additionally, Visa has $2.0 billion in short-term and $0.9 billion in long-term purchase obligations as of September 30, 2024, which include commitments to acquire goods and services, some of which likely support services provided to these financial institution clients. Operationally, Visa's business model is built on its relationships with these clients, as they issue Visa-branded products, manage account holder and merchant relationships, and rely on VisaNet for transaction processing. This creates a dual dependency where Visa's financial obligations and ecosystem viability are both structurally tied to the performance and stability of its financial institution clients.",

T he Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules.

Right-of-use (ROU) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments ov er the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.

Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company), is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money mov ement across  more  than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world's largest electronic payments networks - VisaNet - which prov ides transaction processing serv ices, primarily authorization,  clearing  and  settlement.  T he  Company  offers  products,  solutions  and  serv ices  that  facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money mov ement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients.\n\nConsolidation and basis of presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America  (U.S.  GAAP).  T he  Company  consolidates entities for which it has a controlling financial interest, including v ariable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. T he Company's investments in  VIEs  hav e  not  been  material  to  its  consolidated  financial  statements  as  of  and  for  the  periods  presented.  Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company's activities are interrelated, and each activ ity is dependent upon and supportiv e of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Serv ices.\n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future ev ents. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of rev enue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. T he use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate.\n\nCash,  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash,  and  restricted  cash  equivalents .  Cash  and  cash  equiv alents  include  cash  and  certain  highly  liquid inv estments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equiv alents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair v alue due to their generally short maturities. T he Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equiv alents as cash and cash equiv alents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activ ities. See Note 4-Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents.\n\nRestricted cash equivalents-U.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. cov ered litigation are paid. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. cov ered litigation. T he escrow funds are held in money market inv estments, and classified as restricted cash equiv alents on the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Interest  earned  on  escrow  funds  is  recognized  in  inv estment  income  (expense)  and  other  on  the  consolidated statements of operations.\n\nFair value. T he Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair v alue on a recurring basis. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  property,  equipment  and  technology  are  subject  to  nonrecurring  fair  v alue  measurements  if  they  are  deemed  to  be impaired. Fair v alue is the price that would be receiv ed to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair v alue measurements are reported under a three-lev el v aluation hierarchy.  See Note 6-Fair Value Measurements and Investments.\n\nMarketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities, which are reported in inv estment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include inv estments in publicly traded companies as well as mutual fund inv estments related to v arious employee compensation and benefit plans. Div idend income as well as gains and losses from changes in fair v alue are recognized in inv estment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nTrading activ ity in the mutual fund inv estments is at the direction of the Company's employees. T hese inv estments are held in a trust and are not considered by the Company to be av ailable for its operational or liquidity",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWe validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing providers through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including other pricing services, dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed. Additionally, on an on-going basis, we request more detailed information from the valuation vendors to understand the pricing methodology and assumptions used to value the securities.\n\n## Derivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nWe use both exchange-traded and OTC derivatives to manage our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risk exposures. When quoted market prices are available and used to value our exchange-traded derivatives, we classify them as Level 1. However, the majority of our derivatives do not have readily available quoted market prices. Therefore, we value most of our derivatives using vendor-based models. We primarily rely on market observable inputs for these models, including, for example, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, option volatility and currency rates. These inputs can vary depending on the type of derivatives and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is based. We typically classify derivatives as Level 2 when significant inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model itself does not require significant judgment. When instruments are traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable, such as interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves, such derivatives are classified as Level 3. We consider the impact of credit risk valuation adjustments when measuring the fair value of derivative contracts in order to reflect the credit quality of the counterparty and our own credit quality. Our internal pricing is compared against additional pricing sources such as external valuation agents and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated. These derivatives are included in other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Loans Held for Sale\n\nIn our commercial business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to GSEs. We elect the fair value option for such loans as part of our management of interest rate risk in our multifamily agency business. These held for sale loans are valued based on market observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses on these loans are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Retained Interests in Securitizations\n\nWe have retained interests in various mortgage securitizations from previous acquisitions. Our retained interests primarily include interest-only bonds and negative amortization bonds. We record these retained interests at fair value using  market  indications  and  valuation  models  to  calculate  the  present  value  of  future  cash  flows.  Due  to  the  use  of  significant  unobservable  inputs  such  as  prepayment  and  discount  rate  assumptions,  retained  interests  in securitizations are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Deferred Compensation Plan Assets\n\nWe offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred compensation plan to eligible associates. In addition to participant deferrals, we make contributions to the plan. Participants invest these contributions in a variety of publicly traded mutual funds. The plan assets, which consist of those publicly traded mutual funds, are classified as Level 1.\n\n212\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

(4)\n\n## Securitization-Related VIE s\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a V IE. We engage in securitization activities as an issuer and an investor. Our primary securitization issuance activity includes credit card and auto securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans and transfer them to GSEs who may, in turn, securitize them. We retain the related MSRs and service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and ABS in our investment securities portfolio, which represent variable interests in the respective securitization trusts from which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant as we either solely invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of the MSRs and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets as well as our contractual obligations under loss sharing arrangements. See 'Note 19-Commitments, Contingencies, G uarantees and Others' for information about the loss sharing agreements, 'Note 7-G oodwill and Other Intangible Assets' for information related to our MSRs associated with these securitizations and 'Note 3-Investment Securities' for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See 'Note 4-Loans' for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "question": "How does the valuation and performance of Capital One's net derivative assets (liabilities) reflect both realized and unrealized gains/losses across different periods, and what does this reveal about the sensitivity of these assets to changes in swap rates and market conditions?",
      "answer": "Capital One's net derivative assets (liabilities) had a fair value of $58 million at December 31, 2023, primarily valued using discounted cash flows based on swap rates. During 2023, the company experienced $14 million in realized/unrealized losses included in net income, offset by $166 million in issuances and $69 million in settlements, resulting in a net unrealized gain of $63 million for assets and liabilities still held. In the following year (2024), the balance increased to $69 million, but the company reported $15 million in realized/unrealized losses included in net income and a net unrealized loss of $25 million on assets still held, indicating a decline in value likely tied to changes in swap rates or market conditions. This shows that the valuation of net derivative assets is highly sensitive to market fluctuations, particularly swap rates, and that these assets experienced volatility in both years, with a more pronounced loss in 2024.",

        "Hop 1: [COF](page_217) \u2192 [Net derivative assets (liabilities)]: Discloses the fair value of net derivative assets as $58 million at December 31, 2023, with valuation based on discounted cash flows using swap rates (3-5%) as the key unobservable input.",
        "Hop 2: [COF](page_216) \u2192 [Net derivative assets (liabilities)]: Shows a $14 million loss included in net income during 2023, along with $166 million in issuances and $69 million in settlements, leading to a $58 million ending balance and a $63 million net unrealized gain on assets still held.",

      "answer": "Capital One estimates the $64.9 billion in uninsured deposits using methodologies and assumptions aligned with those applied in their FFIEC 031 filings, which are quarterly regulatory reports submitted to the Federal Banking Agencies. This estimation excludes intercompany balances and cash collateral from derivative contracts not classified as deposits. The same FFIEC 031 framework underpins the maturity analysis of uninsured time deposits shown in the later section, and is also explicitly defined in the glossary section as part of the company's regulatory reporting obligations. This shows that FFIEC 031 serves as a foundational standard for both the calculation and disclosure of uninsured deposit amounts.",

      "answer": "AIG reported a year-end 2021 balance of $19,633 million for notes and bonds payable, which aligns with the $19,633 million listed under liabilities for the same category in the year-end 2021 balance sheet. During 2022, AIG repaid $3,315 million of its debt while also experiencing a $157 million reduction due to foreign exchange effects. This corresponds to the scheduled maturities for 2022 of $17 million and $1,614 million in 2023, suggesting a conservative debt management strategy focused on reducing short-term obligations while maintaining longer-term liabilities.",

      "answer": "AIG's financial treatment of the embedded derivative associated with Fortitude Re reflects a complex interplay between fair value accounting risks, reinsurance structure, and operational restructuring. The embedded derivative, which resides in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is subject to changes in unobservable inputs and has resulted in unrealized gains and losses that include both observable and unobservable factors (e.g., long-dated volatilities). This aligns with the $18 million and $(183) million of net gains (losses) related to Level 3 transfers in 2021 and 2020, highlighting the volatility and risk associated with fair value estimation. The derivative is part of a modco and funds withheld arrangement established in 2018 and valued at $29.6 billion (Life and Retirement) and $3.8 billion (General Insurance) in ceded reserves as of December 31, 2021, which structurally removed Fortitude Re from affiliated status post-sale. Operationally, the transfer of servicing companies to Fortitude Re in 2022 marked a full transition of administrative control, reinforcing the deconsolidation impact and the long-term strategic shift in managing AIG's Run-Off operations.",

As a result, the unrealized gains (losses) on instruments held at December 31, 2021 and 2020 may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable inputs (e.g., changes in unobservable long-dated volatilities).\n\n## Transfers of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in income (loss) or Other comprehensive income (loss) as shown in the table above excludes $18 million and $(183) million of net gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities transferred into Level 3 during 2021 and 2020, respectively, and includes $7 million and $4 million of net gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities transferred out of Level 3 during 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Transfers of Level 3 Assets\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, transfers into Level 3 assets primarily included certain investments in private placement corporate debt, RMBS, CMBS and CDO/ABS. Transfers of private placement corporate debt and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were primarily the result of limited market pricing information that required us to determine fair value for these securities based on inputs that are adjusted to better reflect our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or associated market liquidity. The transfers of investments in RMBS, CMBS and CDO and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were due to diminished market transparency and liquidity for individual security types.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, transfers out of Level 3 assets primarily included private placement and other corporate debt, CMBS, RMBS, CDO/ABS and certain investments in municipal securities. Transfers of corporate debt, RMBS, CMBS, CDO/ABS and certain investments in municipal securities out of Level 3 assets were based on consideration of market liquidity as well as related transparency of pricing and associated observable inputs for these investments. Transfers of certain investments in private placement corporate debt and certain ABS out of Level 3 assets were primarily the result of using observable pricing information that reflects the fair value of those securities without the need for adjustment based on our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or the current liquidity in the market.\n\n## Transfers of Level 3 Liabilities\n\nThere were no significant transfers of derivative or other liabilities into or out of Level 3 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Divested Businesses\n\nThe Level 3 liabilities at December 31, 2020 includes an embedded derivative associated with the funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re that was established as a result of the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale.",

          "chunk_text": "## SALE OF FORTITUDE HOLDINGS\n\nOn June 2, 2020, we completed the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale. AIG established Fortitude Re, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortitude Holdings, in 2018 in a series of reinsurance transactions related to AIG's Run-Off operations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $29.6 billion of reserves from AIG's Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and approximately $3.8 billion of reserves from AIG's General Insurance Run-Off Lines, related to business written by multiple wholly-owned AIG subsidiaries, had been ceded to Fortitude Re under these reinsurance transactions. As of closing of the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, these reinsurance transactions are no longer considered affiliated transactions and Fortitude Re is the reinsurer of the majority of AIG's Run-Off operations. Additionally, the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale was subject to a post-closing purchase price adjustment pursuant to which AIG would pay Fortitude Re for certain adverse development in property casualty related reserves, based on an agreed methodology, that may occur through December 31, 2023, up to a maximum payment of $500 million. Effective in the second quarter of 2021, AIG, Fortitude Holdings, Carlyle FRL, T&amp;D and Carlyle amended the Purchase Agreement to finalize the post-closing purchase price adjustment for adverse reserve development. As a result of this amendment, during 2021, AIG recorded a $21 million benefit through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred and eliminated further net exposure to adverse development on the reserves ceded to Fortitude Re.\n\nThese reinsurance transactions between AIG and Fortitude Re were structured as modco and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld (funds withheld). In modco and funds withheld arrangements, the investments supporting the reinsurance agreements, and which reflect the majority of the consideration that would be paid to the reinsurer for entering into the transaction, are withheld by, and therefore continue to reside on the balance sheet of, the ceding company (i.e., AIG) thereby creating an obligation for the ceding company to pay the reinsurer (i.e., Fortitude Re) at a later date. Additionally, as AIG maintains ownership of these investments, AIG will maintain its existing accounting for these assets (e.g., the changes in fair value of available for sale securities will be recognized within Other comprehensive income (loss)). As a result of the deconsolidation resulting from the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, AIG has established a funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage that Fortitude Re has assumed. The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the funds withheld payable are recognized in earnings through Net realized gains (losses). This embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to various assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements.\n\nThere is a diverse pool of assets supporting the funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Re. The following summarizes the composition of the pool of assets:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Fortitude Re was established during the first quarter of 2018 in a series of reinsurance transactions related to our Run-Off operations. Those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our Insurance Run-Off Lines into a single legal entity. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $29.6 billion of reserves from our Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and approximately $3.8 billion of reserves from our General Insurance Run-Off Lines related to business written by multiple whollyowned AIG subsidiaries, had been ceded to Fortitude Re under these reinsurance transactions.\n\nOf the Fortitude Re reinsurance agreements, the largest is the Amended and Restated Combination Coinsurance and Modified Coinsurance Agreement by and between our subsidiary American General Life Insurance Company (AGL) and Fortitude Re. Under this treaty, approximately $22.6 billion of AGL reserves as of December 31, 2021 were ceded to Fortitude Re representing a mix of life and annuity risks. Fortitude Re provides 100 percent reinsurance of the ceded risks. AGL retains the risk of collection of any third party reinsurance covering the ceded business. At effectiveness of the treaty, an amount equal to the aggregate ceded reserves was deposited by AGL into a modified coinsurance account of AGL to secure the obligations of Fortitude Re. Fortitude Re receives or makes quarterly payments that represent the net gain or loss under the treaty for the relevant quarter, including any net investment gain or loss on the assets in the modified coinsurance account. An AIG affiliate will serve as portfolio manager of assets in the modified coinsurance account for a minimum of three years after the June 2, 2020 closing of the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale.\n\nFollowing receipt of all regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions, effective as of January 1, 2022, AIG sold to an affiliate of Fortitude Re all of the outstanding capital stock of two servicing companies that administer the Life and Retirement and General Insurance ceded business, and the ceding insurers entered into administrative services agreements pursuant to which AIG transferred administration of certain Life and Retirement and General Insurance ceded business to such companies.\n\nFor a summary of significant reinsurers see Enterprise Risk Management - Insurance Risks - Reinsurance Activities - Reinsurance Recoverable.\n\n## LIFE AND ANNUITY FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS, POLICYHOLDER CONTRACT DEPOSITS AND DAC\n\nThe following section provides discussion of life and annuity future policy benefits, policyholder contract deposits and deferred policy acquisition costs.\n\nFor information regarding 2019 life and annuity future policy benefits, policyholder contract deposits and deferred policy acquisition costs, see Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A - Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Future Policy Benefits, Policyholder Contract Deposits and DAC of our 2020 Annual Report.\n\n## Update of Actuarial Assumptions and Models\n\nThe life insurance companies review and update actuarial assumptions at least annually, generally in the third quarter. Assumption setting standards vary between investment-oriented products and traditional long-duration products.\n\n## Investment-Oriented Products\n\nThe life insurance companies review and update estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items (which may include VOBA, DSI and unearned revenue reserves) and assessments used to accrue guaranteed benefit reserves for investment-oriented products at least annually. Estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves are recalculated using the new projections, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n\nThe life insurance companies also review assumptions related to their respective GMWB living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. The fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.\n\nVarious assumptions were updated, including the following effective September 30, 2021:\n\n- The reversion to the mean rates of return (gross of fees) were decreased to 1.04 percent from 3.12 percent for the variable annuity product line in Individual Retirement and increased to 4.04 percent from 2.87 percent for the variable annuity product line in Group Retirement primarily due to recent equity market movements. The separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance remained unchanged at 7.0 percent. The Group Retirement reversion to the mean rate of return had become and had remained less than zero percent, the rate was unlocked and reset to 3.59 percent, which increased the DAC and sales inducement balances by a total of $78 million and decreased reserve balances by $6 million, increasing pre-tax income by a total of $84 million. The long-term growth assumption remained unchanged at 7.0 percent; and\n\n130 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "AIG treats the underwriting cycle's impact on reserving methodologies differently across its casualty lines. In U.S. Other Casualty (page 266), the underwriting cycle significantly influences reserving, with segmentation by claim type (e.g., construction defect, medical malpractice), and increased reliance on expected loss ratio methods for recent accident years due to the long-tail nature of the business. In U.S. Excess Casualty (page 263), the underwriting cycle affects reserving through attachment point strategies, with expected loss ratio methods used for at least the three most recent accident years due to low credibility of reported losses, and segmentation by automobile vs. non-automobile claims and attachment point bands. In UK/Europe Casualty & Financial Lines (page 278), the underwriting cycle is also a key factor, with segmentation by country and line of business, and greater stability in loss development compared to the U.S., though AIG adjusts expected loss ratios for market changes and re-underwriting efforts.

          "chunk_text": "## Reserving Process and Methodology\n\nU.S. Other Casualty includes general liability, automobile liability, environmental, medical malpractice, and other casualty lines of business. These lines of business are all long-tail in nature and while somewhat diverse in terms of exposures, these lines are often subject to similar trends. These lines are often significantly impacted by the underwriting cycle and external judicial trends. Many of our policies contain risk-sharing features, including high deductibles, self-insured retentions or retrospective rating features, in addition to a traditional insurance component. These risk-sharing programs generally are large and complex, comprising multiple products, years and structures, and are subject to amendment over time.\n\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods, frequency/severity and expected loss ratio methods for primary general liability or products liability product lines. We also supplement the standard actuarial techniques by using evaluations of the ultimate losses on unusual claims or claim accumulations by external specialists on those subsets of claims. The segmentation of the data reflects state differences, industry groups, deductible/non-deductible programs and type of claim.\n\nWe segment our analysis by line of business and key coverage structures (claims-made vs. occurrence, large deductible policies, retrospective-rated policies, captives, etc.). Additionally, certain subsets, such as construction defect for general liability, auto liability policies for trucking business, hospital policies for medical malpractice and underground storage tanks for environmental are generally reviewed separately from business in other subsets. We continually refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty product lines and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of the differing emerging loss patterns for certain subsets of insureds. Due to the long-tail nature of general liability business, and the many subsets that are reviewed individually, there is less credibility given to the reported losses and increased reliance on expected loss ratio methods for recent accident years.\n\nFor certain product lines with sufficient loss volume or seasoning, loss development methods may be given significant weight for all but the most recent one or two accident years. For smaller or more volatile subsets of business and excess of a large deductible business, loss development methods may be given limited weight for the five or more recent accident years. Expected loss ratio methods are used for the more recent accident years for these subsets. The loss experience for primary general liability business is generally reviewed at a level that is believed to provide the most appropriate data for reserve analysis. For other subsets, such as environmental, we utilize a combination of claim analysts' loss projections and actuarial methods to estimate ultimate losses.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are generally given significant weight only in the most recent accident year, except for excess of large deductible business, in which expected loss ratio methods may receive weight for several of the most recent accident years. In recent years, the impact of the increase in the frequency of severe claims was projected in the accident years where it was most prevalent. The resulting increase in ultimate loss projections and loss ratios for those years impacted subsequent years through loss development factors and prior expected loss ratio assumptions, also incorporating rate changes, loss trend including inflation, and changing market condition impacts. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques. Changes in Claims organization management, differing referral and review criteria, and other factors may also be expected to alter loss emergence.\n\n264 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

Many of the claims notified to the excess layers are closed without payment because the claims never reach our layer as a result of high deductibles and other underlying coverages, while the claims that reach our layer can have large case reserves or settlements and be highly variable in terms of reported timing and amount. For a portion of this business, the underlying primary policies are issued by other insurance companies, which can limit our access to relevant information to help inform our judgments as the loss events evolve and mature. Furthermore, this coverage is often significantly impacted by the underwriting cycle and external judicial trends.\n\nRecent accident years reflect a strategy towards having higher attachment points on the portfolio through changing participations in various layers within an insured's program.\n\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess casualty product lines. We segment our analysis between automobile-related claims and non-automobile claims, due to the shorter-tail nature of the automobile claims. We then further segment the non-automobile claims for certain latent exposures such as construction defects and mass torts where losses have unique emergence patterns. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over an extended period of time and impact multiple accident years when they emerge. The more standard types of claims are then separately analyzed based on attachment point bands, to recognize that the impact of the level of the attachment point can significantly impact the delay in loss reporting and development. In our analyses, losses capped at $10 million were first analyzed using traditional loss development and expected loss ratio methods and then this estimate was used to derive the expected loss estimate for losses above $10 million reflecting the expected relationships between the layers, reflecting the attachment point and limit.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are generally used for at least the three latest accident years, due to the relatively low credibility of the reported losses. The loss experience is generally reviewed separately by attachment point. The expected loss ratios used for recent accident years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios for older years adjusted for rate changes, loss trend including inflation, and where appropriate, changing market conditions. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns.

UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines is composed of third-party coverages including general liability, auto liability, D&amp;O, professional liability and various other coverages throughout both the UK and Continental Europe. These areas are all long-tail in nature and while somewhat diverse in terms of exposures, these lines are often subject to similar trends. These lines are impacted by the underwriting cycle and external judicial trends. The largest share of business is in the UK, but significant business is also written in other European countries such as Germany, France, and Italy.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by country and line of business. Additionally, we separately review various product lines, including excess versus primary casualty, commercial versus financial institutions management liability, and other specific programs and subsets of business. We maintain a database of detailed historical premium and loss transactions in original currency for business written outside of the U.S. which allows our actuaries to determine loss reserves without foreign exchange distorting development.\n\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods. For countries and coverages with sufficient loss volume, loss development methods may be given significant weight for all but the most recent accident years. For smaller countries and more volatile product lines, loss development methods are typically given limited weight for recent accident years. Further, we may rely on larger data subsets in determining the loss development factors and a priori loss ratio assumptions. Expected loss ratios are continually reevaluated to reflect emerging claim experience, rate changes, loss trends including inflation, or other market and underwriting strategy factors that could affect the appropriateness of the methods being employed. Recent COVID19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques. Also, many subsets of the business have experienced significant re-underwriting efforts and planned turnover which could likely lead to differing emergence patterns over time. Changes in Claims management, differing referral and review criteria, and other factors may also be expected to alter loss emergence.\n\nIn general, the loss development for long-tail lines in UK/Europe has been more stable than the development in U.S. long-tail lines, although some underlying drivers have affected the results in a similar manner (e.g. the impact of the financial crisis in accident years 2008 and 2009, COVID-19, etc.).\n\n## UK/Europe Property and Special Risks\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $118 million of favorable prior year development in the Europe Property and Special Risks segment driven by favorable emergence across several Specialty classes.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $155 million of favorable prior year development in the Europe Property and Special Risks segment driven by lower Property attritional loss activity and favorable emergence across several Specialty classes.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $108 million of favorable prior year development in the Europe Property and Special Risks segment driven by favorable development in Commercial Property and Specialty classes including aviation and marine.\n\n276 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does AIG's use of frequency/severity methods differ across personal lines, property classes, and professional liability lines, and what does this reveal about how the company adjusts reserving methodologies based on claim emergence patterns and severity trends in each segment?",
      "answer": "AIG applies frequency/severity methods differently depending on the line of business and its underlying claim characteristics. In **U.S. Personal Insurance**, frequency/severity methods are used for short-tail lines like personal property and domestic personal auto, where claim counts emerge quickly, allowing for immediate analysis of loss trends\u2014especially important given recent disruptions like the impact of the pandemic on claim patterns. In **U.S. Property** classes, frequency/severity methods are used in combination with loss development and IBNR factor methods, particularly for short-tail exposures, while IBNR factors are favored for low-frequency/high-severity scenarios like aerospace, where claim emergence is less predictable. In contrast, for **professional liability lines** like D&O and E&O, frequency/severity methods are generally not used in isolation due to the dominance of large, high-severity losses. Instead, AIG places more weight on expected loss ratio methods for newer accident years and loss development methods for more mature years, using a capped/excess layer approach to account for variability in severity. This reveals that AIG tailors its reserving methodologies based on claim emergence speed, severity trends, and the impact of external events like the pandemic or legal environment changes.",

The program segments include both property and casualty exposures. Recent years have seen an increasing proportion of non-admitted coverages which has altered the underlying customer profile to be less severe in the aggregate.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by line of business. Additionally, we separately review various subsets, including hull, cargo, and liability for marine business, aviation and satellite for aerospace business, and various other specific programs and product lines.\n\nFrequency/severity methods, loss development methods, and IBNR factor methods are used alone or in combination to set reserves for short-tail classes such as U.S. Property.\n\nIBNR factor methods are used when the nature of losses is low frequency/high severity. The IBNR factors, when applied to earned premium, generate the ultimate expected losses (or other exposure measure) yet to be reported. The factors are determined based on prior accident quarters' loss costs adjusted to reflect current cost levels and the historical emergence of those loss costs. The factors are continually reevaluated to reflect emerging claim experience, rate changes, loss trends including inflation, or other factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed.\n\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for aviation exposures. Aviation claims are not very long-tail in nature; however, they are driven by claim severity. Thus a combination of both development and expected loss ratio methods is used for all but the latest accident year to determine the loss reserves. Frequency/severity methods are not employed due to the high severity nature of the claims and different mix of claims from year to year.\n\nFor program business, we use methods which vary by line of business. For property classes, we use methods similar to those noted above. For liability classes, we use methods similar to those described in the casualty sections detailed above.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are used to determine the loss reserves for the latest accident year. We also use ground-up claim projections provided by our claims staff to assist in developing the appropriate reserve.\n\n## U.S. Personal Insurance\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $412 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions, mainly due to favorable development and subrogation recoveries from the 2017 and 2018 catastrophe years.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $94 million of unfavorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions, mainly due to large losses in Homeowners and Umbrella.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $96 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance driven largely by subrogation recoverable on the 2017 California wildfires and favorable development from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 271",

          "chunk_text": "We use a combination of loss development, expected loss ratio, and frequency/severity methods for D&amp;O, E&amp;O, EPLI, and professional liability. These product lines generally are offered on a claims-made basis and losses are characterized by low frequency and high severity. In general, expected loss ratio methods are given more weight in the more recent accident years and loss development methods are given more weight in more mature accident years. The loss development factors for the different segments differ significantly in some cases, based on specific coverage characteristics and other factors such as industry group, attachment points, and limits offered.\n\nFrequency/severity methods are generally not used in isolation for these product lines as the overall losses are driven by large losses more than by claim frequency. For commercial D&amp;O segments though, we reflect claims dismissal rates in our frequency estimates, particularly for securities class action suits, as claims severity varies directly with claims jurisprudence. Severity trends have varied significantly from accident year to accident year and care is required in analyzing these trends by claim type. In view of the changing severity profile of the book, we use a capped and excess layer approach on many segments to better reflect the potential impact of large claims on the results by accident year.\n\nWe generally use loss development methods for fidelity exposures for all but the latest accident year. For mergers and acquisitions exposure, given the unique profile of each transaction, we use claim department estimates of the ultimate value of each reported claim to supplement and inform the standard actuarial approaches and some weight is given to this method in the more recent accident years.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are also given weight for the more recent accident years. IBNR factor methods are used, when the nature of losses is low frequency/high severity. The IBNR factors, when applied to earned premium, generate the ultimate expected losses (or other exposure measure) yet to be reported. The factors are determined based on prior accident quarters' loss costs adjusted to reflect current cost levels and the historical emergence of those loss costs. The factors are continually reevaluated to reflect emerging claim experience, rate changes, loss trends including inflation, or other market and underwriting strategy factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques. Also, many subsets of the business have experienced significant re-underwriting efforts and planned turnover which could likely lead to differing emergence patterns over time. Changes in Claims management, differing referral and review criteria, and other factors may also be expected to alter loss emergence.\n\n## U.S. Property and Special Risks\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $172 million of unfavorable prior year development in U.S. Property and Special Risks driven largely by the impact of reductions in reinsurance recoveries driven by changes in catastrophe loss estimates.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $80 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Property and Special Risks driven largely by attritional property and favorable emergence on specialty losses coming in better than expected.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $204 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Property and Special Risks driven largely by favorable development on the 2017 Hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Maria) as well as subrogation recoverable on the 2017 California wildfires and by favorable emergence on non-Catastrophe Commercial Property, Program and Specialty classes.\n\n268 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does AIG's disclosure of the $6.247 billion debt of consolidated investment entities in its balance sheet reconcile with the off-balance sheet exposure commitments and the prior guarantee obligations tied to securitization vehicles?",
      "answer": "AIG reports $6.247 billion in debt of consolidated investment entities on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, which includes $4.504 billion from securitization vehicles. Separately, AIG discloses an off-balance sheet exposure of $2.2 billion at year-end 2021, primarily consisting of commitments to real estate and investment entities. Additionally, prior to 2021, AIG had guaranteed capital contribution obligations tied to six securitization VIEs, which were terminated by year-end 2021, resulting in a $175 million reduction in debt of consolidated investment entities. These perspectives show that while a significant portion of the debt is consolidated, AIG also had contingent financial commitments and past guarantees that could impact its exposure to these entities beyond the balance sheet amount.",

      "answer": "MS's exposure to General Partner Guarantees is directly tied to the potential obligation to return performance fee distributions previously received, which becomes relevant when the returns in certain funds fall below specified performance targets. This risk is quantified through the unrealized carried interest at risk of reversal, as noted in the disclosures. Additionally, the structure of non-redeemable funds, such as private equity and real estate funds, prolongs the period during which these guarantees may be triggered, as distributions are only realized when underlying investments are monetized. Finally, the accounting treatment of performance-based fees, which are measured based on the Firm's claim on the fund's net asset value and are subject to reversal if performance thresholds are not maintained, further influences the financial implications of these guarantees.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MS](page_144) \u2192 [General Partner Guarantees]: MS discloses that its portion of net cumulative performance-based fees in the form of unrealized carried interest is at risk of reversal when fund returns fall below performance targets, and General Partner Guarantees include potential obligations to return these distributions.",
        "Hop 2: [MS](page_103) \u2192 [General Partner Guarantees]: The structure of non-redeemable funds (e.g., private equity, real estate) means that distributions\u2014and thus potential obligations under General Partner Guarantees\u2014are realized only when underlying investments are monetized, extending the time horizon for these guarantees to be triggered.",

When  the  Firm  earns  carried  interest  from  funds  as  specified performance thresholds are met, that carried interest and any related general or limited  partner  interest  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of accounting and measured based on the Firm's claim on the NAV  of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. Such items are reflected within Investments revenues.\n\nSee Note 22 for information regarding the net cumulative unrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at risk of reversal. See Note 14 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.\n\n## Other Items\n\nRevenues  from  certain commodities-related contracts are recognized in Trading  revenues  when  the  Firm  has  transferred  control  over  the  promised goods or services to the customer.\n\nReceivables  from  contracts  with  customers  are  recognized  in  Customer  and other  receivables  in  the  balance  sheet  when  the  underlying  performance obligations have been satisfied and the Firm has the right per the contract to bill the customer. Contract assets are recognized in Other assets when the Firm has satisfied its performance obligations but customer payment is conditional on  something  other  than  the passage  of time. Contract liabilities are recognized  in  Other  liabilities  and  accrued  ex penses  when  the  Firm  has collected payment from a customer based on the terms of the contract but the underlying performance obligations are not yet satisfied.\n\nFor contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental costs to obtain the contract  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Revenues  are  not  discounted  when payment is expected within one year.\n\nThe  Firm  generally  presents,  net  within  revenues,  taxes  assessed  by  a governmental  authority  that  are  both  imposed  on  and  concurrent  with  a specific  revenue-producing  transaction  and  collected  by  the  Firm  from  a customer.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of Cash and due from banks and interestbearing deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible to cash and are not held for trading purposes.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  also  include  Restricted  cash,  such  as  cash segregated in compliance with federal or other regulations, including minimum reserve requirements set by the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks, and the Firm's initial margin deposited with clearing organizations.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nInstruments within Trading assets and Trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either as required or allowed by accounting guidance. These financial instruments  primarily  represent  the  Firm's  trading  and  investment  positions and  include  both  cash  and  derivative  products.  In  addition,  securities classified as Available-for-Sale ('AFS') are measured at fair value.\n\nGains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are reflected in Trading revenues,  Investments  revenues  or  Investment  banking  revenues  in  the income statement, except for gains and losses related to AFS securities (see 'AFS  Investment  Securities'  section  herein  and  Note  7)  and  derivatives accounted for as hedges, as well as economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments (see 'Hedge Accounting' and 'Other Hedges' herein and Note 6).\n\nInterest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statement depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. When interest is included as a component of the instruments' fair  value,  interest  is  recorded  within  Trading  revenues  or  Investments revenues. Otherwise, it is recorded within Interest income or Interest expense. Dividend  income  is  recorded  in  Trading  revenues  or  Investments  revenues depending on the business activity.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  OTC  financial  instruments,  including  derivative  contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. Additionally, the Firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.\n\n## Fair Value Option\n\nThe  Firm  has  elected  to  measure  certain  eligible  instruments  at  fair  value, including Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Loans and lending commitments, equity method investments and certain other assets, Deposits, Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, Other secured financings and Borrowings.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement-Definition and Hierarchy\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e ., the 'ex it price') in",

Submission of interim targeted information by our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  generally  will  not  be  required  during  a  year  which  the  Parent Company is required to submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and FDIC. The first submission for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under this rule will be in 2026. In addition, the OCC requires IDIs with assets of $100 billion or more,  including  our  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries,  to  develop  recovery  plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial stress,  but  have  not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent. Our U.S.  Bank Subsidiaries are required to develop a recovery plan by January 2026.\n\nIn addition, certain financial companies, including BHCs such as the Firm and certain of its subsidiaries, can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly  liquidation  authority,  with  the  FDIC  being  appointed  as  receiver, provided that determination of extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk  is  made  by  the  U.S.  Treasury  Secretary  in  consultation  with  the  U.S. president.  Regulators  have  adopted  certain  orderly  liquidation  authority implementing regulations and may expand or clarify these regulations in the future. If we were subject to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would have  considerable  powers,  including:  the  power  to  remove  directors  and officers responsible for our failure and to appoint new directors and officers; the power to assign our assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company  without  the  need  for  creditor  consent  or  prior  court  review;  the ability to differentiate among our creditors, including treating certain creditors within the same class better than others, subject to a minimum recovery right on the part of disfavored creditors to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and broad powers to administer the claims process  to  determine  distributions  from  the  assets  of  the  receivership.  The FDIC has indicated that it expects to use an SPOE strategy if the FDIC were to implement the orderly liquidation authority for a U.S. G-SIB.\n\nRegulators have also taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation authority or other resolution regimes.\n\nFor  more  information  about  our  resolution  plan-related  submissions  and associated  regulatory  actions,  see  'Risk  Factors-Legal,  Regulatory  and Compliance  Risk,'  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Liquidity  and  Capital  ResourcesRegulatory Requirements-Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Regulatory Requirements-Resolution and Recovery Planning.'\n\n## Institutional Securities and Wealth Management\n\nU.S. Bank  Subsidiaries. Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are FDIC-insured depository institutions subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the  OCC  and  are  subject  to  the  OCC's  risk  governance  guidelines,  which establish  heightened  standards  for  a  large  IDI's  risk  governance  framework and the oversight of that framework by the IDI's board of directors. Our U.S. Bank  Subsidiaries  are  also  subject  to  prompt  corrective  action  standards, which require the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain  capital  adequacy  standards.  In  addition,  BHCs,  such  as  Morgan Stanley,  are  required  to  serve  as  a  source  of  strength  to  their  U.S.  bank subsidiaries and commit resources to support these subsidiaries in the event such  subsidiaries  are  in  financial  distress.  Our  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries' business  activities are generally limited  to  supporting  our  Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.\n\nOur U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which impose restrictions on certain transactions with affiliates, including any extension of credit to, or purchase of assets from, an affiliate. These restrictions limit the total amount of credit ex posure that our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  may  have  to  any  one  affiliate  and  to  all  affiliates  and  require collateral for those ex posures. Section 23B requires affiliate transactions to be on market terms.\n\nAs  commonly  controlled  FDIC-insured  depository  institutions,  each  of  our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries could be responsible for any loss to the FDIC from the failure of the other U.S. Bank Subsidiary.\n\nBroker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation.

LLC ('MS&amp;Co.'),\n- Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC ('MSSB'),\n- Morgan Stanley Europe SE ('MSESE'),\n- Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc ('MSIP'),\n- Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC ('MSCS'),\n- Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ('MSCG'),\n- Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd. ('MSMS'),\n- Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. ('MSBNA') and\n- Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association ('MSPBNA').\n\nFor further information on the Firm's significant regulated U.S. and international subsidiaries, see Note 16.\n\n## 2. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Presentation Changes in 2024\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Firm implemented certain presentation changes which resulted in a decrease to both interest income and interest expense of $4,432  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  and  no  effect  on  net interest  income,  with  the  entire  impact  to  the  Firm  recorded  within  the Institutional Securities segment. These changes further aligned the accounting  treatment  between  the  balance  sheet  and  the  related  interest income  or  ex pense,  primarily  by  offsetting  interest  income  and  ex pense  for certain  prime  brokerage-related  customer  receivables  and  payables  that  are currently accounted for as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The current  and  previous  presentation  of  these  interest  income  and  interest expense amounts are acceptable and the change does not represent a change in  accounting  principle.  These  changes  were  applied  retrospectively  to  the consolidated income statement for 2023 and accordingly, 2023 amounts were adjusted to conform with the current presentation.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to  our  customers in an amount that is based on the consideration the  Firm expects  to  receive  in  ex change  for  those  goods  or  services  when  such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nRevenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fix ed income securities and loan syndications,  and  advisory  fees,  primarily  for  mergers,  acquisitions  and restructurings.\n\nUnderwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty  or  contingency  related  to  the  amount  to  be  paid.  Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.\n\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated  progress  of  work  and  when  revenues  are  not  probable  of  a significant reversal. Advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.\n\n## Commissions and Fees\n\nCommission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements  in  which  the  client  is  charged  a  fee  for  the  ex ecution  of transactions. Such  revenues  primarily  arise  from  transactions  in  equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to brokerdealers,  ex changes  and  market  centers  for  ex ecution.  Commission  and  fee revenues  are  recognized  on  trade  date  when  the  performance  obligation  is satisfied.\n\n## Asset Management Revenues\n\nAsset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels, such as the AUM of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. These fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the value of the assets is known. Management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.\n\nPerformance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.\n\nSales  commissions  paid  by  the  Firm  in  connection  with  the  sale  of  certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred  commission  assets  and  amortized  to  Other  expenses  over  the expected life of the contract. The Firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods.  Other  asset  management  and  distribution  costs  are  recognized  as incurred in the relevant non-interest ex penses line items.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MS reported $122,342 million in 'Other Sovereign Government Obligations' under securities sold under agreements to repurchase, increasing to $135,806 million in 2024, indicating growing exposure. On the liabilities side, the fair value of 'Other Sovereign Government Obligations' under trading liabilities was $30,790 million in 2023 and decreased slightly to $24,520 million in 2024, suggesting a partial offset or hedging adjustment. Additionally, in secured financing activities, these obligations contributed $956 million in 2024, up from $1,020 million in 2023, showing a marginal decline in short-term secured liability tied to this asset class. This evolution suggests a strategic increase in holding these obligations while managing associated liabilities more conservatively.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley accounts for Employee Stock Trusts by consolidating their assets with those of the Firm and treating them similarly to treasury stock, where shares issued to the trusts offset an equal amount in the balance sheet under 'Employee stock trusts.' The Firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation to record movements of shares to or from the trusts, without recognizing changes in fair value since the compensation must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares. Over the reporting periods, the balance in Employee Stock Trusts decreased from $5,314 million in 2023 to $5,103 million in 2024, as disclosed in the equity section of the balance sheet. This aligns with the detailed activity in the equity statement, where 'Share-based award activity' for Employee Stock Trusts shows a reduction of $211 million in 2024, contributing to the ending balance. The offsetting entry, 'Common stock issued to employee stock trusts,' also reflects a decrease from $5,314 million to $5,103 million, consistent with the consolidated treatment described in the notes to the financial statements.",

Where  award  terms  are  considered  to  be subjective, a grant date cannot be established and the awards are subject to variable  accounting  which  requires  that  compensation  expense  for  those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the Firm's common stock or the  relevant  model  valuation,  as  appropriate,  until  conversion,  ex ercise  or expiration. Following amendments to clarify specific subjective award terms in the second quarter of 2023, a grant date for the awards was established such that compensation expense for those awards is no longer adjusted for changes in  the  fair  value  of  the  Firm's  common  stock.  The  Firm  also  operates  an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ('ESPP') which allows eligible employees of the Firm to purchase shares of Morgan Stanley at a discount.\n\n## Employee Stock Trusts\n\nIn  connection  with  certain  stock-based  compensation  plans,  the  Firm  has established employee stock trusts to provide, at its discretion, common stock voting rights to certain RSU holders. Following the grant of an RSU award, when a stock trust is utilized, the  Firm contributes shares to be held in the stock  trust  until  the  RSUs  convert  to  common  shares.  The  assets  of  the employee  stock  trusts  are  consolidated  with  those  of  the  Firm  and  are generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding reported in Common stock issued to employee stock trusts are offset by an equal amount reported in Employee stock trusts in the balance sheet.\n\nThe Firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recording the movement of the assets to or from the employee stock trusts. Changes in the fair value are not recognized as the Firm's stock-based compensation must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares of the Firm's common stock.\n\n## Deferred Cash-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation expense for DCP awards is calculated based on the notional value  of  the  award  granted,  adjusted  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the referenced  investments  that  employees  select.  Compensation  expense  is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards.\n\nThe  Firm  invests  directly,  as  a  principal,  in  financial  instruments  and  other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under its DCP. Changes in the value of such investments are recorded in Trading revenues and  Investments  revenues.  Although  changes  in  compensation  expense resulting  from  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  referenced  investments  will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm's investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.\n\n## Retirement-Eligible Employee Compensation\n\nFor year-end stock-based awards and DCP awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated cost of the awards over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.\n\n## Carried Interest Compensation\n\nThe  Firm  generally  recognizes  compensation  expense  for  any  portion  of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that is allocated to employees. For  information  on  performance-based  fees  in  the  form  of  carried  interest, which  are  directly  related  to  carried  interest  compensation,  see  'Revenue Recognition-Carried Interest' herein.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recorded  based  upon  the  temporary differences  between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax  ex pense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date. Such effects are recorded in Provision for income taxes regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.\n\nThe Firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the  Firm  considers  all  available  positive  and  negative  evidence,  including future  reversals  of  ex isting  tax able  temporary  differences,  projected  future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. When performing the assessment, the Firm considers all types of deferred tax assets in  combination  with  each  other,  regardless  of  the  origin  of  the  underlying temporary difference. If a deferred tax  asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. If the Firm subsequently determines that it would be able  to  realize  deferred  tax   assets  in  ex cess  of  their  net  recorded amount,  it  would  make  an  adjustment  to  the  deferred  tax   asset  valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n\nThe Firm recognizes tax expense associated with G lobal Intangible Low-Taxed Income  as  it  is  incurred  as  part  of  the  current  income  tax es  to  be  paid  or refunded for the current period.\n\nUncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  on  the  basis  of  a  two-step  process, whereby (i) the Firm determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax  positions that meet this threshold, the Firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax  authority.

      "answer": "AIG's treatment of Fortitude Re funds withheld assets shows varying levels of financial impact across sections: in adjusted pre-tax income, these assets are explicitly called out as a distinct component of realized gains and losses; in the net realized gains and losses section, the embedded derivative related to these assets is identified as a source of volatility; and in the fair value impact analysis, the change in unrealized gains on these assets was $734 million in 2023, with derivative assets/liabilities also disclosed. This reveals that Fortitude Re funds withheld assets are a material and volatile component of AIG's investment portfolio, influencing both income stability and fair value reporting.",

      "question": "How does AIG's treatment of Fortitude Re funds withheld assets in its non-GAAP book value adjustments reconcile with the realized gains/losses on those assets and the credit quality deterioration of underlying office loans supporting the arrangements?",
      "answer": "AIG adjusts its non-GAAP book value per share metric by excluding cumulative unrealized gains and losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets (page 47), as these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. However, these same assets directly impact AIG's GAAP net realized gains/losses, where appreciation results in losses to AIG and depreciation results in gains (page 96). This dynamic is further complicated by the credit quality deterioration of office loans supporting these arrangements, which were over 90 days delinquent or in foreclosure at December 31, 2022, and later foreclosed and reclassified to 'Other invested assets' by December 31, 2023 (page 180). The interplay suggests that while AIG removes the volatility of these assets from its non-GAAP book value, the realized performance of these assets\u2014now impaired or foreclosed\u2014still directly affects AIG's GAAP results.",

      "answer": "AIG's reinsurance transactions with Fortitude Re involve the establishment of a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage assumed by Fortitude Re. This asset is tied to a funds-withheld payable that contains an embedded derivative, which is treated as a total return swap. Changes in the fair value of this derivative are recognized in earnings through realized gains (losses), directly contributing to volatility in AIG's GAAP net income. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, AIG ceded $27.6 billion in reserves from Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and $3.0 billion from General Insurance Run-Off Lines to Fortitude Re, highlighting the materiality of this arrangement. The valuation of this embedded derivative and its impact on net income is further influenced by the same accounting framework that governs the reinsurance asset, creating a direct link between the asset's treatment, the derivative's volatility, and the substantial reserve transfers from AIG's run-off operations.",

      "question": "How does AIG's valuation of Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable on the balance sheet reconcile with the allowance for credit losses and the composition of loan types, particularly considering the treatment of life insurance policy loans versus commercial mortgages?",
      "answer": "AIG reports Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable at $51,553 million on the balance sheet, which reflects the unpaid principal balances net of the allowance for credit losses. The rollforward of the allowance for credit losses (as disclosed in another section) indicates active management of expected losses, particularly for commercial mortgages and other loans. Meanwhile, life insurance policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances without an allowance, as they are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policies. This distinction in treatment shows a differentiated risk profile and accounting approach across loan categories.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG (page_270) \u2192 Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable: Discloses the total amount of Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable as $51,553 million, net of allowance, and shown at that value on the balance sheet.",

        "Hop 3: AIG (page_178) \u2192 Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable: Details the composition of the loans, noting that life insurance policy loans are carried at unpaid principal with no allowance, while commercial and residential mortgages are carried net of allowance, with interest income accrued and costs amortized."

      "question": "Given that Paidy represented less than 1% of PayPal's consolidated assets and revenue, how does the company's consolidation of $98 million in long-term debt from Paidy-related VIEs align with its decision to exclude Paidy from internal control over financial reporting assessments?",
      "answer": "PayPal excluded Paidy from its internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) assessments because it was acquired in 2021, and SEC guidance permits exclusion of newly acquired entities for the first year. Paidy represented less than 1% of PayPal\u2019s consolidated revenue and assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles), which management cited as a rationale for the exclusion. However, despite this exclusion, PayPal consolidates two VIEs related to Paidy that hold loans receivable and carry $98 million in long-term debt. This creates a nuanced situation where Paidy\u2019s financial structure\u2014though minor in overall asset and revenue terms\u2014is still materially reflected in PayPal\u2019s consolidated liabilities, raising questions about the alignment between the operational significance of these VIEs and the exclusion of Paidy from ICFR evaluation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 listed in the index appearing under  Item  15(a)(2)  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  'consolidated  financial  statements').  We  also  have  audited  the  Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also  in  our  opinion,  the  Company  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Changes in Accounting Principles\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on financial instruments in 2020 and the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over  financial  reporting,  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in Management's report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nAs described in Management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management has excluded Paidy, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2021. We have also excluded Paidy, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Paidy, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management's assessment and our audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  represent  less  than  1%  of  the  related  consolidated  financial  statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2021, the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our  management,  including  our  principal  executive  officer  and  principal financial  officer,  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  the framework  in Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn October 2021, we completed our acquisition of Paidy, Inc. ('Paidy'). Based upon Securities and Exchange Commission staff guidance, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first  year  of  acquisition.  We  have  excluded  Paidy  from  our  assessment  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of December  31,  2021.  Paidy  is  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  whose  total  revenue  and  assets,  excluding  goodwill  and  intangibles, represented less than 1% of our total consolidated revenue and consolidated assets for the year ended and as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  an  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,  as  stated  in  their  report  which  appears  in Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.\n\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined  in  Exchange Act  Rule  13a-15(f)  that  occurred  during  our  most  recently  completed  fiscal  quarter  that  have  materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## ITEM 9B.

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 1-OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## OVERVIEW AND ORGANIZATION\n\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. ('PayPal,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our') was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading  technology  platform  that  enables  digital  payments  and  simplifies  commerce  experiences  on  behalf  of  merchants  and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants  and  consumers  to  manage  and  move  their  money  anywhere  in  the  world  in  the  markets  we  serve,  anytime,  on  any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person ('P2P') payments.\n\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all  aspects of the payments industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including the changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation\n\nThe  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  financial  statements  of  PayPal  and  our  wholly-  and  majorityowned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The noncontrolling interest reported in the prior period was a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheets and represented the equity interests not owned by PayPal, and was recorded for consolidated entities we controlled and of which we owned less than 100%. Noncontrolling interest was not presented separately on our consolidated statements of income as the amount was de minimis.\n\nInvestments in entities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investee's results of operations is included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. Investments in entities where we do not have the ability to exercise  significant  influence  over  the  investee  are  accounted  for  at  fair  value  or  cost  minus  impairment,  if  any,  adjusted  for changes resulting from observable price changes, which are included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. Our investment balance is included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe determine at the inception of each investment, and re-evaluate if certain events occur, whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a variable interest entity ('VIE'). If we determine an investment is in a VIE, we then assess if we are the primary beneficiary, which would require consolidation.\n\nWe have consolidated two VIEs that provide financing for and hold loans receivable of Paidy, Inc. ('Paidy'). We are the primary beneficiary  of  the  VIEs  as  we  perform  the  servicing  and  collection  for  the  loans  receivable  which  are  the  activities  that  most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and we have the obligation to absorb the losses and/or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to these entities. The financial results of our consolidated VIEs are included in  the  consolidated financial statements. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs is included as short-term investments of $87 million, loans and interest receivable, net of $21 million, and long-term debt of $98 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash of $87 million, included in short-term investments, is restricted to settle the debt obligations.",

      "question": "How does PayPal's approach to protecting merchants and consumers through its Protection Programs, as described in both qualitative business context and quantitative financial disclosures, reflect its competitive positioning and risk management strategy, particularly in light with the allowance for transaction losses and the treatment of these programs as assurance-type warranties?",
      "answer": "PayPal's Protection Programs are positioned as a competitive differentiator and trust-building mechanism in a highly competitive payments landscape, where they are highlighted as broader or at least consistent with industry standards. These programs, which include buyer and seller protections against fraud and counterparty non-performance, are treated as assurance-type warranties under accounting standards, with associated costs estimated and recorded in transaction and credit losses during the period of the payment. Financially, PayPal maintained an allowance for transaction losses of $121 million as of December 31, 2021, down from $144 million in the prior year, indicating a reduction in expected losses, which aligns with their qualitative emphasis on robust systems and data-driven fraud prevention. The programs are not only central to PayPal's brand positioning as a trusted payments provider but also reflect a structured financial commitment to risk mitigation, balancing competitive differentiation with prudent accounting treatment.",

These  programs  are  intended  to  protect  both  merchants  and  consumers  from  loss  primarily  due  to  fraud  and  counterparty performance.  Our  buyer  protection  program  provides  protection  to  consumers  for  qualifying  purchases  by  reimbursing  the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does not arrive or does not match the seller's description. Our seller  protection  programs provide protection to merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims that an item was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales. Additionally, in some instances we provide protection for cryptocurrencies held in PayPal accounts in case of loss directly resulting from service provider insolvency or in the event the service provider's private keys are compromised.

Evaluating  whether  an  incentive  is  a  payment  to  a  customer requires judgment. Incentives that are determined to be consideration payable to a customer or paid on behalf of a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Certain incentives paid to users that are not customers are classified as sales and marketing expense.\n\nWe  provide  merchants  and  consumers  with  protection  programs  for  certain  transactions  completed  on  our  payments  platform. These  programs  are  intended  to  protect  both  merchants  and  consumers  from  loss  primarily  due  to  fraud  and  counterparty performance.

Our seller  protection  programs provide protection to merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims that a purchased item was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales. These protection programs do not provide a separate service to our customers and we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed.\n\n## REVENUES FROM OTHER VALUE ADDED SERVICES\n\nWe earn revenues from other value added services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services that we provide to our merchants and consumers. These contracts typically have one performance obligation which is provided and recognized over the term of the contract. The transaction price is generally fixed and known at the end of each reporting period; however, for some agreements, it may be necessary to estimate the transaction price using the expected value method. In our partnership agreement with Synchrony, in addition to the revenue share we earn, we also recognized revenue for transition servicing activities which we performed on their behalf through the second quarter of 2019 using a relative selling price determined through the adjusted market assessment approach. We record revenue earned in revenues from other value added services on a net basis when we are considered the agent with respect to processing transactions.\n\nWe also earn revenues from interest and fees earned primarily on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances. Interest and fees earned on the portfolio of loans receivable are computed and recognized based on the effective interest method and are presented net of any required reserves and amortization of deferred origination costs.\n\n## DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\n\nWe determine  operating  segments  based  on  how  our  chief  operating  decision  maker  ('CODM')  manages  the  business,  makes operating decisions around the allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical  markets  and  type  of  revenue  categories  (transaction  revenues  and  revenues  from  other  value  added  services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially the same.",

Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and counterparty malicious activities, represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. We believe that these programs, which help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. These programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers, who will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, and merchants, who will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer.\n\nOur ability to protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world's most trusted payments brands.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe  global  payments  industry  is  highly  competitive,  continuously  changing,  highly  innovative,  and  increasingly  subject  to regulatory  scrutiny  and  oversight.  Many  of  the  areas  in  which  we  compete  evolve  rapidly  with  innovative  and  disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.\n\nWe compete with a wide range of businesses. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are, have larger  customer  bases,  greater  brand  recognition,  longer  operating  histories,  a  dominant  or  more  secure  position,  broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors  are  or  may  be  smaller  or  younger  companies  that  may  be  more  agile  in  responding  quickly  to  regulatory  and technological changes.\n\nWe differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences  for  our  merchants,  demonstrate  that  they  may  achieve  incremental  sales  by  using  and  offering  our  services  to consumers, support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods, through the simplicity and  transparency  of  our  fee  structure,  and  our  seller  protection  programs.  In  addition,  we  differentiate  ourselves  to  consumers through  the  ability  to  use  our  products  and  services  across  multiple  commerce  channels,  including  e-commerce,  mobile,  and payments at the point of sale, and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our  customer  service,  dispute  resolution,  and  buyer  protection  programs;  and  our  ability  to  simplify  and  personalize  shopping experiences.  We  invest  resources  towards  improving  our  products  and  services,  offering  choice  in  payment  options,  providing excellent customer service, and building brands that merchants and consumers trust.\n\nOur business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, 'payment cards'), electronic bank transfers, and credit), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and 'card on file' services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services including tokenized and contactless payment cards, digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale, virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services  face  competition  from  all  forms  of  payments,  which  include  paper-based  payments  (primarily  cash  and  checks),  credit cards, debit cards, electronic bank transfers, credit, installment methods, digital wallets and mobile payment solutions, contactless payments (including contactless cards, tokenized cards, Near Field Communication based solutions, and QR code-based solutions), and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\n\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the caption ' We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry' for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business.",

      "answer": "PayPal's credit risk management for merchant receivables is reflected through a multi-layered approach: (1) the allowance for credit losses is modeled using historical loss data, macroeconomic forecasts (e.g., unemployment and credit card charge-off rates), and qualitative adjustments, with forecast periods ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 years; (2) historical net charge-offs for merchant receivables are tracked and reported net of recoveries, with reserve changes reflecting evolving economic conditions and accounting standards like CECL; and (3) PayPal mitigates exposure by selling participation interests in merchant receivables to WebBank, with both parties sharing losses pro rata, and the transfers accounted for as sales, thereby reducing PayPal's direct risk of loss.",

          "chunk_text": "We also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable, which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The allowance is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio, which is segmented by factors such as geographic region, delinquency, and vintage. Loss curves are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segments of each portfolio, categorized by factors such as geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, credit rating and vintage, which vary by portfolio. We then apply macroeconomic factors such as forecasted  trends  in  unemployment  and  benchmark  credit  card  charge-off  rates, which are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. We utilize externally sourced macroeconomic scenario data to supplement our historical information due to the limited period in which our credit product offerings have been in existence. Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments  that  incorporate  incremental  information  not  captured  in  the  quantitative  estimates  of  our  current  expected  credit losses. Our consumer receivables consist of revolving products, which do not have a contractual term, and installment products. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products, installment products, and merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, is approximately 2 years, approximately 7 months to 2.5 years, and approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years, respectively. In 2020, the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving consumer products was based only on externally sourced data due to the lack of availability of historical data, and in 2021, it was updated to reflect historical loss experience with the portfolio. The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\n\nDetermining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and  events  occur  that  may  impact  the  settlement  or  recovery  of  losses.  The  allowances  are  maintained  at  a  level  we  deem appropriate  to  adequately  provide  for  current  expected  credit  losses  at  the  balance  sheet  date  after  incorporating  the  impact  of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts. These forecasts project scenarios such as future unemployment and benchmark credit card  charge-off  rates. As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  utilized  externally  published  projections  of  the  U.S.  and  U.K.  forecasted unemployment  rates  over  the  reasonable  and  supportable  forecast  period.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  we  utilized  externally published  projections  of  the  U.S.  forecasted  credit  card  charge-off  rates  and  U.K  forecasted  unemployment  rates  over  the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was  approximately  9%  and  23%,  respectively. A  significant  change  in  the  forecasted  macroeconomic  factors  could  result  in  a material change in our allowances. Our allowance as of December 31, 2021 took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers, including uncertainty around the effectiveness  of  loan  modification  programs  made  available  to  merchants.  Our  allowance  as  of  December  31,  2020  took  into account for the proactive and reactive measures that we took to help reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers, limitations  in  our  expected  credit  loss  models  that  arose  due  to  the  extreme  fluctuations  in  both  the  actual  and  forecasted macroeconomic conditions in the period, varying degrees of merchant performance in the current environment as well as expected future performance, and to account for payment holidays granted. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these actions which may result in adjustments to our allowance for loans and interest receivable in future periods. An increase of 1% in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately $53 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nOur  annual  tax  rate  is  based  on  our  income,  statutory  tax  rates,  and  tax  planning  opportunities  available  to  us  in  the  various jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate. Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including  evaluating  uncertainties.  We  review  our  tax  positions  quarterly  and  adjust  the  balances  as  new  information  becomes available.  Our  income  tax  rate  is  significantly  affected  by  the  tax  rates  that  apply  to  our  foreign  earnings.  In  addition  to  local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through provisions such as the GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations.",

If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities or impairment is considered other-than-temporary for our equity method investments (and prior to January 1, 2020, available-for-sale debt securities), we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements  of  income.  Prior  to  January  1,  2020,  this  assessment  with  respect  to  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  took  into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, our intent to sell the security, whether it was more likely than not we would be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether we expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, whether a credit loss existed).

For  the  remaining  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  an  unrealized  loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any portion of impairment not related to credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Loans and interest receivable, net\n\nLoans and interest receivable, net represents merchant receivables originated under our PayPal Working Capital ('PPWC') product and  PayPal  Business  Loan  ('PPBL')  product  and  consumer  loans  originated  under  our  PayPal  Credit  and  installment  credit products.

WebBank  extends  credit  to  merchants  for  the  PPWC  and  PPBL  products  and  we  are  able  to  purchase  the related  receivables  originated  by  WebBank.  For  our  merchant  finance  products  outside  the  U.S.,  we  extend  working  capital advances  and  loans  in  Europe  through  our  Luxembourg  banking  subsidiary,  and  working  capital  loans  in Australia  through  an Australian  subsidiary.  In  the  U.S.,  we  extend  installment  loans  to  consumers  through  a  U.S.  subsidiary.  For  our  international consumer credit products, we extend credit in Europe through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary, and in Australia and Japan, through local subsidiaries.\n\nAs part of our arrangement with WebBank in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in the pool of merchant receivables for the PPWC and PPBL products. WebBank has no recourse against us related to their participation interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by WebBank have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit, prepayment, and interest rate risk associated with this pool of merchant receivables. All risks of loss are shared pro rata based  on  participation  interests  held  among  all  participating  stakeholders.  We  account  for  the  asset  transfer  as  a  sale  and derecognize the portion of the participation interests for which control has been surrendered. For this arrangement, gains or losses on the sale of the participation interests are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximates the fair value at time of transfer.\n\nIn instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loans or advances and the related interest receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we will be unable to collect all amounts due, therefore resulting in a troubled debt restructuring ('TDR'). Refer to 'Note 11-Loans and Interest Receivable' for further information related to TDRs.\n\nLoans, advances, and interest and fees receivable are reported at their outstanding balances, net of any participation interests sold and pro rata current expected credit losses, including unamortized deferred origination costs. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables outstanding and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.\n\nWe offer both revolving and installment credit products to our consumers. The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit  monthly  bills  to  the  consumer  detailing  loan  repayment  requirements.  The  terms  also  allow  us  to  charge  the  consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.",

      "question": "How does PayPal's strategic positioning of merchant finance products in terms of business value and customer engagement align with the financial structure and credit risk management of these offerings, particularly given the repayment terms and geographic concentration of the merchant receivables?",
      "answer": "PayPal positions its merchant finance products (PPWC and PPBL) as strategic tools to deepen engagement with small and medium-sized businesses and expand service offerings, especially where traditional financing may be inaccessible. These products generated revenue from interest and fees, with a total outstanding balance of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Structurally, PPWC loans are repaid through a fixed percentage of future PayPal payment volume, typically within 9 to 12 months, while PPBL loans have fixed periodic payments over 3 to 12 months. PayPal actively monitors delinquency trends and repayment performance, using internal risk models that incorporate payment history and external credit data. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 82% of merchant receivables were U.S.-based, indicating a high geographic concentration, which could amplify credit risk exposure if economic conditions deteriorate in that region. This alignment shows that while the products are strategically valuable for merchant engagement, they also carry concentrated financial and credit risk that PayPal actively manages.",

We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by WebBank and are responsible for servicing functions related to that portfolio. We purchased approximately $1.8 billion in credit receivables in both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant  loans,  advances,  and  interest  and  fees  receivable  was  $1.4  billion  for  both  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  net  of  the participation  interest  sold  to  WebBank  of  $63  million  and  $59  million,  respectively.  See  'Note  1-Overview  and  Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies' for additional information on this participation arrangement.\n\nThrough our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant's future payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been satisfied.\n\nThe interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant's payment processing history with PayPal, where available. For PPWC, there is a general requirement that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the repayment rate of the merchant's future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from 3 to 12 months.\n\nWe actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period, as well as the credit quality of our merchant loans and advances that we extend or purchase so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data sources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary drivers of the models include the merchant's annual payment volume, payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with PayPal's credit  products  where  available,  information  sourced  from  consumer  and  business  credit  bureau  reports,  and  other  information obtained  during  the  application  process.  We  use  delinquency  status  and  trends  to  assist  in  making  (or,  in  the  U.S.,  to  assist WebBank in making) ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our internal models, to plan our collection strategies, and in determining our allowance for these loans and advances.\n\n100",

The PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to access a loan or cash advance for a fixed fee and based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-term financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both  the  applying  business  as  well  as  the  business  owner.  In  the  United  States  ('U.S.'),  these  products  are  provided  under  a program agreement with WebBank. We believe that these merchant finance offerings enable us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available effectively or efficiently from traditional banks or other lending providers.\n\nOur acquisition of Paidy, Inc. ('Paidy') enables us to expand our buy now, pay later solutions and other capabilities in Japan. Our acquisition of Guofubao Information Technology Co. (GoPay), Ltd., a holder of payment business licenses in China, enables us to partner with Chinese financial institutions and technology platforms to provide a more comprehensive set of payment solutions to merchants and consumers, both in China and globally.\n\nWe generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other paymentrelated services. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans receivables.\n\n## Consumer value proposition\n\nWe focus on providing affordable, convenient, and secure consumer financial products and services intended to democratize the management  and  movement  of  money.  We  provide  consumers  with  a  digital  wallet  that  enables  them  to  send  payments  to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, credit cards, debit cards, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards.\n\nWe  also  offer  consumers  person-to-person  ('P2P')  payment  solutions  through  our  PayPal,  Venmo,  and  Xoom  products  and services. We enable both domestic and international P2P transfers across our payments platform. Our Venmo digital wallet in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to make purchases at select merchants. Xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money and prepaid mobile phone reloads to, and pay bills for, people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential PayPal users to establish active accounts with us at the time they make or receive a P2P payment. We also simplify and personalize shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price-tracking,  offers,  and  easier  exchanges  and  returns,  which  enhances  consumer  engagement  and  sales  conversion  for  our merchants.\n\nWe offer credit products to consumers in certain markets as a potential funding source at checkout. Once a consumer is approved for  credit,  the  product  is  made  available  as  a  funding  source  for  that  account  holder.  The  U.S.  PayPal-  and  Venmo-branded consumer  credit  program  is  offered  through  Synchrony  Bank.  We  offer  a  PayPal-issued  PayPal  Credit  product  in  the  United Kingdom ('U.K.') and a PayPal branded consumer credit card issued by Citigroup in Australia. In addition, we have expanded our consumer credit offerings to include buy now, pay later installment products in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Australia, Spain, Italy, and through the acquisition of Paidy, in Japan. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of consumer late  fees  for  missed  payments in most of the geographies where we offer it. We believe that our consumer credit products help enable us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network.\n\nWe have expanded our consumer value proposition through enhancements to the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, which provide increased  functionality  for  consumers  to  explore  deals  and  offers  and  to  more  easily  transact  with  cryptocurrencies  in  certain markets. Our goal is to drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a comprehensive set of services to manage their finances and enhancing their ability to shop online and in person.\n\nWe  generate  revenue  from  consumers  on  fees  charged  for  foreign  currency  conversion,  instant  transfers  from  their  PayPal  or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, interest, fees, or other revenue from credit product programs, and other miscellaneous fees.",

T he inputs to value these investm ents m ay include the C om pany's capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investm ents, including hedge funds, real assets and private equity funds. The various partnerships are investm ent com panies, which record their underlying investm ents at fair value based on fair value policies established by m anagem ent of the underlying fund.

T he shares were valued at $5.9 billion at close, based on the price of BlackR ock's com m on stock on Septem ber 30, 2024 of approxim ately $950, discounted for security-specific registration restrictions for two years after closing, resulting in a value of approxim ately $855 per share. In addition, as part of the purchase consideration, a contingent consideration paym ent, all in stock, m ay be due subject to achieving certain perform ance targets. T he contingent consideration paym ent, if any, ranges from  4.0 m illion to 5.2 m illion shares, and will be valued based on the price of BlackR ock's com m on stock at the tim e the contingency is resolved.

      "question": "How did BlackRock's equity securities at FVTNI change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the firm's investment strategy and risk exposure based on the shift in Level 1 assets and CIP-held portions?",
      "answer": "BlackRock's equity securities at FVTNI increased from $1,585 million in 2023 to $1,950 million in 2024, reflecting a significant year-over-year growth. This increase was accompanied by a rise in Level 1 quoted prices for these securities, which stood at $1,950 million in 2024 compared to $1,585 million in 2023, indicating a stronger reliance on more liquid, actively traded assets. Additionally, the CIP-held portions of these securities rose from $1,429 million in 2023 to $1,556 million in 2024, suggesting an increased use of consolidated investment products to manage these assets. Together, these shifts point to a strategic move toward more transparent and liquid investments, while leveraging CIPs for operational and risk management benefits.",

At December 31, 2024, the total separate account collateral was $6,059 million, consisting of $2,719 million in equity securities and $3,340 million in debt securities (page_94). Comparing this to the prior year, the collateral increased from $4,558 million in 2023 (page_95), indicating a growth in securities lending activity. However, in the as-adjusted statement of financial condition (page_55), BlackRock explicitly excludes separate account assets and collateral, along with their offsetting liabilities, to provide a clearer view of the company's economic position by removing assets and liabilities that do not impact stockholders' equity or cash flows. This exclusion aligns with BlackRock\u2019s rationale that it has no economic interest in these assets, though it earns advisory fees from managing them. Thus, the financial statements reflect the full legal ownership of the collateral, while the adjusted view removes it to focus on the company's core economic exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "The Organisation for E conom ic C ooperation and D evelopm ent ('O E C D ') has proposed certain international tax reform s, which, am ong other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consum er ('P illar O ne') and (2) establish a global m inim um  tax for m ultinational com panies of 15% ('P illar T wo'). I n response, E uropean U nion m em ber states and several other countries, including the U nited Kingdom , have since adopted laws im plem enting the O E C D 's m inim um  tax rules under P illar T wo, effective starting in 2024. As a result of these developm ents, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackR ock does business have changed and m ay continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. T he P illar T wo F ram ework did not have a m aterial im pact on BlackR ock's consolidated financial statem ents for 2024 and the C om pany is continuing to m onitor legislative developm ents and evaluate the potential im pact of the P illar T wo F ram ework on future periods.\n\n## 2023 I ncom e tax expense (G AAP ) reflected:\n\n\u00b7 a discrete tax benefit of $201 m illion, related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax m atters; and\n\n\u00b7 a discrete tax benefit of $41 m illion, related to stock-based com pensation awards that vested in 2023.\n\n## STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVE RVIE W\n\n## As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statem ent of financial condition presented on a G AAP  basis to the consolidated statem ent of financial condition, excluding the im pact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreem ents (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreem ents and C IP s.\n\nThe Com pany presents the as adjusted statem ent of financial condition as additional inform ation to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or N C I  that ultim ately do not have an im pact on stockholders' equity or cash flows. M anagem ent views the as adjusted statem ent of financial condition, which contains non-G AAP financial m easures, as an econom ic presentation of the C om pany's total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-G AAP  financial measures in isolation from , or as a substitute for, financial inform ation prepared in accordance with G AAP .\n\nSeparate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements\n\nSeparate account assets are m aintained by BlackR ock Life Lim ited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the C om pany that is a registered life insurance com pany in the U K, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The C om pany records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. T he separate account assets are not available to creditors of the C om pany and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the C om pany's assets. T he net investm ent incom e attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statem ents of incom e. W hile BlackR ock has no econom ic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackR ock earns an investm ent advisory fee for the service of m anaging these assets on behalf of its clients.\n\nI n addition, the C om pany records on its consolidated statem ents of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackR ock Life Lim ited securities lending arrangem ents for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. T he collateral is not available to creditors of the C om pany, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangem ents have no recourse to the C om pany's assets.\n\nConsolidated Sponsored Investment Products\n\nThe Com pany consolidates certain sponsored investm ent products accounted for as variable interest entities ('VIE s') and voting rights entities ('VR E s'). See N ote 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statem ents contained in P art II, I tem  8 of this filing for m ore inform ation on the C om pany's consolidation policy.\n\nThe Com pany cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by C IP s to use in its operating activities. In addition, the C om pany cannot readily sell investm ents held by C I P s in order to obtain cash for use in the C om pany's operations.",

      "question": "How does BlackRock's financial treatment of the Aladdin platform in its revenue disclosures align with the operational risks and restructuring initiatives tied to the platform?",
      "answer": "BlackRock's revenue model for Aladdin, which is primarily based on the value of positions on the platform, reflects its strategic importance and recurring revenue potential. However, the platform's expansion and processing scale growth, as noted in the risk factors, expose the company to operational, regulatory, and cybersecurity risks that could undermine revenue stability. Additionally, a $61 million restructuring charge in 2023 was incurred to reorganize the Aladdin platform and private markets, indicating that the company is actively investing in platform optimization despite the associated financial and operational risks. This suggests a strategic balancing act between scaling Aladdin for revenue growth and managing the complex risks and costs tied to its development and regulatory environment.",

The C om pany earns distribution and service fees related to distributing investm ent products and shareholder support services for investm ent portfolios. D istribution fees are passed-through to third-party distributors, which perform  various fund distribution services and shareholder servicing of certain funds on the C om pany's behalf, and are recognized as distribution and servicing costs. T he C om pany presents distribution fees and related distribution and servicing costs incurred on a gross basis.\n\nDistribution fees prim arily consist of ongoing distribution fees, shareholder servicing fees and upfront sales com m issions for serving as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for certain m anaged m utual funds. T he service of distribution is satisfied at the point in tim e when an investor m akes an investm ent in a share class of the m anaged m utual funds. F ees are generally considered variable consideration because they are based on the value of AU M  and are uncertain on trade date. Accordingly, the C om pany recognizes distribution fees when the am ounts becom e known and the portion recognized in the current period m ay relate to distribution services perform ed in prior periods. U pfront sales com m issions are recognized on a trade date basis. Shareholder servicing fees are based on AU M  and recognized in revenue as the services are perform ed.\n\nAdvisory and other revenue. Advisory and other revenue prim arily includes fees earned for advisory services, fees earned for transition m anagem ent services prim arily com prised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of custom ers, and equity m ethod investm ent earnings related to certain strategic investm ents.\n\nAdvisory services fees are determ ined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over tim e as the related services are com pleted.\n\nCommissions related to transition m anagem ent services are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.\n\nStock-based Compensation . T he C om pany recognizes com pensation cost for equity classified awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award. T he com pensation cost is recognized over the period during which an em ployee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award.\n\nThe Com pany generally m easures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units ('R SU s') using the C om pany's stock price on the date of grant. T he grant-date fair value related to the October 2024 incentive retention R SU s granted in connection with the G IP  T ransaction, are reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate, given that they are not entitled to participate in dividends until they vest (See N ote 3, Acquisitions and Note 18, Stock-Based Compensation for further inform ation on the G I P  T ransaction). Stock-based awards m ay have perform ance, m arket and/or service conditions. F or em ployee stock options and awards with m arket conditions, the C om pany uses pricing m odels. C om pensation cost for awards containing perform ance conditions is recognized if it is probable that the conditions will be achieved. T he probability of achievem ent is assessed on a quarterly basis. If a stock-based award is m odified after the grant-date, increm ental compensation cost is recognized for an am ount equal to the excess of the fair value of the m odified award over the fair value of the original award im m ediately before the modification. Awards under the C om pany's stock-based com pensation plans vest over various periods. C om pensation cost is recorded by the C om pany on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, m ultiple awards and is adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\n\nThe Com pany am ortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based com pensation awards m ade to retirem ent-eligible em ployees over the requisite service period. U pon notification of retirem ent, the C om pany accelerates the unam ortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirem ent notification period.\n\nThe Com pany recognizes all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in incom e tax expense on the consolidated statem ents of incom e, which results in volatility of incom e tax expense as a result of fluctuations in the C om pany's stock price. Accordingly, the C om pany recorded a discrete incom e tax benefit of $37 m illion, $41 m illion and $87 m illion during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for vested R SU s where the grant date stock price was lower than the vesting date stock price.\n\nDistribution and Servicing Costs . D istribution and servicing costs include paym ents to third parties, prim arily associated with distribution and servicing of client investm ents in certain BlackR ock products. D istribution and servicing costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nDirect Fund Expense . D irect fund expense, which is expensed as incurred, prim arily consists of third-party non-advisory expense incurred by BlackR ock related to certain investm ent products for the use of certain index tradem arks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund adm inistration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund.\n\nLeases . T he C om pany determ ines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. T he C om pany accounts for its office facility leases as operating leases, which m ay include escalation clauses that are based on an index or m arket rate. T he C om pany accounts for lease and non-lease com ponents, including com m on areas m aintenance charges, as a single component for its leases. The C om pany elected the short-term  lease exception for leases with an initial term  of 12 m onths or less. C onsequently, such leases are not recorded on the consolidated statem ents of financial condition. T he C om pany's lease term s include options to extend or term inate the lease when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised or not.",

T hese updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin 's processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated tim e fram es and m ay expose BlackR ock to additional cyberand inform ation-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data m anagem ent risks. If BlackR ock is unable to m anage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackR ock m ay experience client attrition, reduced business, increased costs, reputational harm  or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which m ay cause BlackR ock's AU M , revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nI n addition, the highly regulated business activities of m any Aladdin clients m ay expose BlackR ock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. F or exam ple, the changing political and regulatory environm ent in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackR ock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client's home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions m ay expose BlackR ock to increased operational com plexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the com pliance requirem ents of such jurisdictions. In addition, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny globally on technology and inform ation providers, which m ay im pact Aladdin and certain functionalities and tools.\n\n## A failure to effectively manage the development and use of AI, combined with an evolving regulatory environment, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock's growth, reputation or business.\n\nBlackR ock uses m achine learning and AI in its business and expects to continue to expand its AI capabilities, including through generative AI. AI m ethods are com plex and rapidly evolving, and the introduction of AI into new or existing processes m ay result in new or enhanced governm ental or regulatory scrutiny, IP  or other litigation, data protection, confidentiality or inform ation security risks, social or ethical concerns, com petitive harm  or other com plications. F or exam ple, the use of datasets to develop and test AI m odels, the content generated by AI system s, or the application of AI system s m ay be found to be insufficient, biased or harm ful, or lead to adverse business decisions or operating errors. AI technologies, including generative AI, m ay create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed. In addition, IP  ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies are still being developed and have not been fully addressed by U S courts or federal, state or non-U S laws or regulation. F urtherm ore, regulatory scrutiny of AI technologies and controls continues to evolve globally with new and forthcom ing laws and regulations. E fforts around use of these technologies require additional investm ent in operational controls and procedures, developm ent and im plem entation of appropriate protections and safeguards for handling the use of data with AI, including with respect to data leakage, fraud prevention and regulatory com pliance costs. AI technologies m ay also disrupt the com petitive landscape for investm ent m anagem ent and technology services, including in com m ercial and operational areas such as data aggregation and quantitative m odels. Any failure to successfully integrate AI technologies, respond to client or m arket dem ands, accurately com m unicate AI initiatives, com ply with AI-related regulations, identify or address any legal or regulatory issues associated with AI or effectively m anage the related risks could harm  BlackR ock's growth and reputation, adversely im pact product offerings, client interactions or business initiatives, and expose the C om pany to legal and regulatory liabilities and additional costs, including regulatory fines or sanctions, which m ay cause its AU M , revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock's AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.\n\nBlackR ock's ability to m eet anticipated cash needs depends upon a num ber of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackR ock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirem ents, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity fram eworks as well as certain other prudential requirem ents and standards, which require them  to m aintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. F ailure to m aintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackR ock to revise existing or future strategic and business initiatives. BlackR ock's access to equity and debt m arkets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or obtain lines of credit or com m ercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable term s m ay be lim ited by adverse m arket conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term  credit ratings, or changes in governm ent regulations, including tax and interest rates. F ailure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, m ay cause BlackR ock's AU M , liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and lim it or im pede its prospects for growth.\n\n## Operating risks associated with BlackRock's securities lending program may result in client losses.\n\nBlackR ock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers as agent on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory m inim um s. Securities on loan are m arked to m arket daily to determ ine if the borrower is required to provide additional collateral. BlackR ock must m anage this process and is charged with m itigating the associated operational risks. T he failure of BlackR ock's controls to m itigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the C om pany's clients that participate in its securities lending program s (separate from  any losses related to the risks of collateral investm ents), and BlackR ock m ay be held liable for any failure to m anage such risks.\n\n## Inorganic transactions may harm the Company's competitive or financial position if they are not successful.\n\nBlackR ock em ploys a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring sm aller-sized investm ent team s, m aking m inority investm ents in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into strategic joint ventures and acquiring investm ent m anagem ent and technology businesses, analytics, m odels and other IP . I norganic transactions involve a num ber of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in som e cases, the assum ption of pre-existing liabilities, which m ust be m anaged in order for BlackR ock to realize the benefit of such transactions, and such transactions m ay be the subject of unanticipated liabilities arising from  com m ercial, client or other disputes, inform ation security vulnerabilities or breaches and IP  or other legal claim s.",

          "chunk_text": "## CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Derivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nWe use both exchange-traded and OTC derivatives to manage our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risk exposures. When quoted market prices are available and used to value our exchange-traded derivatives, we classify them as Level 1. However, the majority of our derivatives do not have readily available quoted market prices. Therefore, we value most of our derivatives using vendor-based models. We primarily rely on market observable inputs for these models, including, for example, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, option volatility and currency rates. These inputs can vary depending on the type of derivatives and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is based. We typically classify derivatives as Level 2 when significant inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model itself does not require significant judgment. When instruments  are  traded  in  less  liquid  markets  and  significant  inputs  are  unobservable,  such  as  interest  rate  swaps  whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves, such derivatives are classified as Level 3. We consider the impact of credit risk valuation adjustments when measuring the fair value of derivative contracts in order to reflect the credit quality of the counterparty and our own credit quality. Official internal pricing is compared against additional pricing sources such as external valuation agents and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated. These derivatives are included in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Loans Held for Sale\n\nIn our commercial business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to GSEs. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we elected the fair value option for such loans as part of our management of interest rate risk in our multifamily agency business. These held for sale loans are valued based on market observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses on these loans are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Retained Interests in Securitizations\n\nWe have retained interests in various mortgage securitizations from previous acquisitions. Our retained interests primarily include interest-only bonds and negative amortization bonds. We record these retained interests at fair value using market indications and valuation  models  to  calculate  the  present  value  of  future  cash  flows.  The  models  incorporate  various  assumptions  that  market participants use in estimating future cash flows including voluntary prepayment rate, discount rate, default rate and loss severity. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, retained interests in securitizations are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Deferred Compensation Plan Assets\n\nWe offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred compensation plan to eligible associates. In addition to participant deferrals, we make contributions to the plan. Participants invest these contributions in a variety of publicly traded mutual funds. The plan assets, which consist of publicly traded mutual funds, are classified as Level 1.\n\nThe determination of the leveling of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our  understanding  of  the  valuation  techniques  and  significant  inputs.  Based  upon  the  specific  facts  and  circumstances  of  each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the observable or unobservable inputs to the instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

          "chunk_text": "## CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Loan Classification\n\nWe classify loans as held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and management's intent and ability with regard to the loans, which may change over time. The accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification, whether we elect the fair value option, whether the loans are originated or purchased and whether purchased loans  are  considered  to  have  experienced  a  more-than-insignificant  deterioration  in  credit  quality  since  origination.  The presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows is based on management's intent at acquisition or origination. Cash flows related to loans that are acquired or originated with the intent to hold for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows related to loans that are acquired or originated with the intent to sell are included in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Loans Held for Investment\n\nLoans that we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future and loans associated with consolidated securitization transactions are classified as held for investment. Loans classified as held for investment, except for credit card loans, are reported at  their  amortized  cost  basis,  excluding  accrued  interest.  For  these  loans,  we  elect  to  present  accrued  interest  within  interest receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans classified as held for investment, earned finance charges and fees are included in either loans held for investment (if they have been billed to the customer) or interest receivable (if they have not yet been billed to the customer).\n\nInterest income is recognized on performing loans on an accrual basis. We defer loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs on originated loans, premiums and discounts on purchased loans and loan commitment fees. We recognize these amounts in interest income as yield adjustments over the life of the loan and/or commitment period using the effective interest method. For credit  card  loans,  loan  origination  fees  and  direct  loan  origination  costs  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  a  12-month period. The amortized cost of loans held for investment is subject to our allowance for credit losses methodology described below under the 'Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment' section of this Note.\n\n## Loans Held for Sale\n\nLoans that we intend to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. Multifamily commercial real estate loans originated with the intent to sell to government-sponsored enterprises are accounted for under the fair value option. We elect the fair value option on these loans as part of our management of interest rate risk along with the corresponding forward sale commitments. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred and are reported in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Interest income is calculated based on the loan's stated rate of interest and is reported in interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nAll  other  loans  classified  as  held  for  sale  are  recorded  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value.  Loan  origination  fees,  direct  loan origination costs and any discounts and premiums are deferred until the loan is sold and are then recognized as part of the total gain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans held for sale is determined on an aggregate portfolio basis for each loan type. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nIf a loan is transferred from held for investment to held for sale, then on the transfer date, any decline in fair value related to credit is recorded as a charge-off and any allowance for credit losses is reversed through our provision for credit losses. The loan is then reclassified to held for sale at its amortized cost at the date of the transfer. A valuation allowance is established, if needed, such that the loan held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we report write-downs or recoveries in fair  value up to the carrying value at the date of transfer and realized gains or losses on loans held for sale in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest income. We calculate the gain or loss on loan sales as the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold, net of the fair value of any residual interests retained.",

Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.\n\nWe also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to ongoing credit and counterparty settlement risk, including purchasing  securities  for  our  investment  securities  portfolio,  entering  into  derivative  transactions  to  manage  our  market  risk exposure  and  to  accommodate  customers,  extending  short-term  advances  on  syndication  activity  including  bridge  financing transactions  we  have  underwritten,  depositing  certain  operational  cash  balances  in  other  financial  institutions,  executing  certain foreign  exchange  transactions  and  extending  customer  overdrafts.  We  provide  additional  information  related  to  our  investment securities  portfolio  under  'MD&amp;A-Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  Analysis-Investment  Securities'  and  credit  risk  related  to derivative transactions in 'Note 9-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.'\n\n## Primary Loan Products\n\nWe provide  a  variety  of  lending  products.  Our  primary  loan  products  include  credit  cards,  auto  loans  and  commercial  lending products.\n\n- Credit cards: We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO scores, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.\n- Auto: We originate both prime and subprime auto loans through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, and are subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are  generally  based  on  an  applicant's  income,  estimated  net  disposable  income,  and  credit  bureau  information  including FICO scores, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ('LTV') ratio. We maintain an auto securitization program.\n- Commercial: We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees, if any, and  current  market  conditions.  Although  we  generally  retain  the  commercial  loans  we  underwrite,  we  may  syndicate positions  for  risk  mitigation  purposes,  including  bridge  financing  transactions  we  have  underwritten.  In  addition,  we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "Capital One adopted the CECL standard for accounting purposes on January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election for regulatory capital purposes in Q1 2020. This allowed the company to delay the full regulatory capital impact of CECL until December 31, 2021, and then phase it in at 25% per year from 2022 to 2024. During 2020\u20132021, Capital One added back to regulatory capital the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact plus 25% of the increase in allowances since adoption. From 2022 onward, the cumulative impact is phased in at 25% annually. This election supports Capital One\u2019s ability to maintain its CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios above the minimum requirements, which are 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively, under the stress capital buffer framework for the 2021\u20132022 period. The CECL Transition Election is integrated into the broader Basel III Capital Rules and tailored Category III capital adequacy framework, which includes a CET1 minimum of 4.5%, Tier 1 minimum of 6.0%, and total capital minimum of 8.0%, along with a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%.",

Therefore,  the  Company's  minimum  capital  requirements  plus  the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework were 10.1%, 11.6% and 13.6%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021.\n\nBased on the Company's 2021 supervisory stress testing results, the Company's stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is 2.5%. Therefore, the Company's minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Banks. The capital conservation buffer for the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, each Bank's minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5% respectively.\n\nIf the Company or any of the Banks fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital  conservation  buffer  requirements,  it  will  face  increasingly  strict  automatic  limitations  on  capital  distributions  and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, each of the Company and the Banks exceeded the minimum capital requirements and  the  capital  conservation  buffer  requirements  applicable  to  them,  and  each  of  the  Company  and  the  Banks  was  'wellcapitalized.' The 'well-capitalized' standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve's regulations, and the 'well-capitalized' standards applicable to the Banks are established in the OCC's PCA capital requirements.\n\n## Market Risk Rule\n\nThe 'Market Risk Rule' supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See 'MD&amp;A-Market Risk Profile' below for additional information.\n\n## CECL Transition Rule\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the 'CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit loss ('CECL') standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year.

The  Basel  III  Capital  Rules  implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('Basel Committee'), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions. Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to  prompt  corrective  action  ('PCA')  capital  regulations,  which  require  the  Federal  Reserve,  OCC  and  the  Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the 'Federal Banking Agencies') to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet PCA capital requirements.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a  minimum  leverage  ratio  of  4.0%  and  a  minimum  supplementary  leverage  ratio  of  3.0%.  We  are  also  subject  to  the  capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements, as described below.\n\nFollowing amendments to the Basel III Capital Rules in October 2019 by the Federal Banking Agencies to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions (the 'Tailoring Rules'), the Company, as  a  bank  holding  company  ('BHC')  with  total  consolidated  assets  of  at  least  $250  billion  but  less  than  $700  billion  and  not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, is a Category III institution.\n\nAs a Category III institution, effective January 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework and certain associated capital requirements, and we have elected to exclude certain elements of AOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. We remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%) and supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3.0%.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks ('G-SIBs') that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the 'G-SIB Surcharge.' We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a GSIB Surcharge.\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the 'CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit loss ('CECL') standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020.

      "answer": "BlackRock's $738 million in capital commitments to Sponsored Investment Products, including CIPs and private equity funds, represents a contingent liability that is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet but could require future funding. This exposure is separate from the company's $8.0 billion in outstanding borrowings, which includes specific notes like the 2024 and 2033 Notes, and carries future interest payments totaling $1.4 billion. At the same time, BlackRock consolidates certain Sponsored Investment Products as VIEs due to its control and economic interest, which introduces additional risk as these assets are subject to market volatility and are not available to creditors of BlackRock. Together, these elements show a layered exposure: direct debt obligations, contingent capital commitments, and off-balance-sheet risk through VIE consolidation, all tied to Sponsored Investment Products.",

      "question": "How does the impact of market change on BlackRock's institutional active equity assets in 2023 compare to their ETF equity assets and the five-year equity market change trend, and what does this suggest about their market sensitivity across different product structures?",
      "answer": "In 2023, market change contributed $29.1 billion to institutional active equity assets (from page_6), compared to $362.9 billion from ETF equity assets (from page_47). Over the five-year period, equity assets experienced a $2.02 trillion market change increase (from page_4). This suggests that while ETFs were significantly more impacted by market movements in 2023, institutional active equity strategies still experienced meaningful market sensitivity, though to a much lesser degree than ETFs in that year.",

      "answer": "BlackRock reports $288 million in cash held by CIPs as part of its liquidity and capital resources, yet notes that it cannot readily access this cash for operating activities, highlighting a mismatch between reported liquidity and actual operational availability. Meanwhile, BlackRock's total investments, including CIPs, increased to $9.7 billion in 2023 from $7.5 billion in 2022, with a portion of these investments classified under Level 3 fair value inputs, indicating significant reliance on unobservable or nonbinding broker quotes for valuation. This creates complexity in assessing the true economic exposure and risk associated with CIPs, as the valuation methods (including unobservable inputs) and access limitations affect both financial reporting and operational flexibility.",

      "answer": "BlackRock uses forward foreign exchange contracts and futures with a total notional value of approximately $204 million to hedge exposure to market movements on deferred cash compensation plans. These hedging instruments are designed to offset the impact of market valuation changes on these plans, which are reflected in nonoperating income (expense), net of NCI, as adjusted. The company holds investments totaling $241 million in equity method investments, $14 million in equity securities at FVTNI, and $9 million in other investments to economically hedge these compensation plans, aligning the financial impact of market fluctuations with their risk management strategy.",

      "question": "How does Capital One's accounting treatment of credit card partnership loss sharing arrangements reconcile with their exposure to securitization-related VIEs and the impact on net charge-offs and credit loss provisions?",
      "answer": "Capital One's credit card partnership loss sharing arrangements reduce both the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses by netting expected reimbursements from partners, which also results in lower net charge-offs. These arrangements are part of broader securitization-related VIEs where Capital One retains exposure through MSRs and investment securities, and where maximum loss exposure includes contractual obligations under these loss sharing agreements. The impact of these arrangements on financial performance is quantified in the reconciliation table showing changes in estimated reimbursements over time, which directly affects the credit loss provision and net charge-offs reported in the income statement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [COF](page_170) \u2192 [Loss Sharing Arrangements]: The document states that Capital One's maximum exposure to loss from involvement with securitization-related VIEs includes contractual obligations under loss sharing arrangements, and that these are detailed in Note 18, with MSRs and investment securities also contributing to exposure.",
        "Hop 2: [COF](page_168) \u2192 [Loss Sharing Arrangements]: The credit card partnership loss sharing arrangements are presented on a net basis, reducing the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses.

        "Hop 3: [COF](page_145) \u2192 [Loss Sharing Arrangements]: The accounting treatment of loss sharing arrangements is governed by contractual provisions and accounting guidance, with expected reimbursements reducing both the reported charge-off amounts and the credit loss provision in the income statement, and the allowance for credit losses being adjusted accordingly."

      "question": "How does Capital One\u2019s current capital adequacy framework under Basel III interact with the proposed Basel III Finalization Proposal, particularly in relation to its Category III status and the planned recognition of AOCI in CET1 capital?",
      "answer": "Capital One, as a Category III institution with total consolidated assets between $250 billion and $700 billion, currently operates under the Basel III Capital Rules, which require a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and total capital ratio of 8.0%. Under these rules, Capital One has elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from CET1 capital. However, the Basel III Finalization Proposal, applicable to institutions with $100 billion or more in assets, would require Category III institutions like Capital One to begin recognizing AOCI, including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, in CET1 capital. This change would affect how Capital One calculates its regulatory capital and may influence its capital planning and risk management strategies. The proposal includes a transition period through July 1, 2028, allowing Capital One time to adjust its capital framework accordingly.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [COF](page_9) \u2192 [Basel III Finalization Proposal]: Capital One, as a Category III institution, is subject to Basel III Capital Rules that currently allow exclusion of AOCI from CET1 capital.",
        "Hop 2: [COF](page_11) \u2192 [Basel III Finalization Proposal]: The Basel III Finalization Proposal would require Category III institutions to recognize AOCI in CET1 capital and introduces a new risk-weighted asset framework that could lower capital ratios.",
        "Hop 3: [COF](page_113) \u2192 [Basel III Finalization Proposal]: The glossary formally defines the Basel III Finalization Proposal as a rulemaking applicable to institutions with $100 billion or more in assets, including Capital One, with a phased implementation through 2028."

For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer, net of any related reserves. Loans held for sale are recorded at either fair value (if we elect the fair value option) or at the lower of cost or fair value. |\n| CECL: In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments .

      "answer": "American Express targets a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 10 to 11 percent (from page 65) to maintain capital levels above regulatory minimums and support business flexibility. However, access to its $4.0 billion syndicated bank credit facility (from page 72 and confirmed on page 127) is restricted if the CET1 ratio falls between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent, limiting capital distributions and facility access. Despite having no amounts drawn on the facility as of year-end, this creates a tension between maintaining strategic capital buffers for growth and the operational constraints imposed by covenant thresholds tied to the same CET1 ratio.",

      "answer": "American Express estimates its Membership Rewards liability using the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) and weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are derived from statistical models and 12 months of redemption data (page_128). The program relies heavily on third-party partners like Amazon and Delta for redemption options, and any inability to maintain these partnerships could diminish the program's value to card members and impact retention (page_29). Additionally, the program's structure\u2014where points typically don't expire and can be earned across a wide range of merchants\u2014directly influences customer spending behavior and enrollment levels, which in turn affects the liability and overall expense (page_84). Therefore, the financial modeling of the program is closely tied to both customer behavior and external partnership risks.",

      "question": "Given American Express's significant financial commitments to cobrand partners, how does the company's exposure through minimum payment obligations align with the rising costs of maintaining these relationships and the competitive risks associated with renewing them on favorable terms?",
      "answer": "American Express has approximately $14.0 billion in outstanding financial commitments tied to cobrand partner agreements, which are largely satisfied by payments made based on Card Members' spending and rewards earned. These payments are also reflected in the company's contra-revenue and business development expenses, which have increased due to more competitive pressures in renewing cobrand relationships. Furthermore, the company faces intense competition for cobrand partnerships, and the risk of losing or renegotiating these relationships on less favorable terms could significantly impact its business, especially since cobrand portfolios accounted for 21% of worldwide network volumes and 36% of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2023. This combination of financial commitments, rising costs, and competitive risk creates a complex exposure that could materially affect profitability and growth if not managed effectively.",

      "question": "How does the significant year-over-year increase in JPMorgan's beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs reflect in both the balance sheet growth, interest expense dynamics, and average yield characteristics, and what does this imply about the firm's reliance on and cost of this funding source?",
      "answer": "The beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased by 83% year-over-year to $23.02 billion (from $12.61 billion) as shown in the balance sheet (page 61). This increase contributed $727 million to the total interest expense change in 2023, with a relatively high average rate of 5.11% on these instruments (page 312). The interest expense on these VIE liabilities grew by $346 million due to rate increases, indicating that JPMorgan's growing reliance on this funding source came at a rising cost amid broader rate hikes. This suggests that while VIE beneficial interests have become a more prominent liability instrument, their increasing cost may impact net interest margins going forward.",

        "Hop 1: JPM (page_61) \u2192 VIE Beneficial Interests: Shows a significant 83% increase in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, rising from $12.61 billion in 2022 to $23.02 billion in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: JPM (page_316) \u2192 VIE Beneficial Interests: Reveals that the change in interest expense for these VIE liabilities was $727 million in 2023, with $346 million attributed to rate increases, indicating rising funding costs.",

      "question": "How does JPMorgan's use of securities purchased under resale agreements reflect in its cash flow dynamics, credit risk management, and fair value accounting practices, and what does this reveal about the strategic role of these agreements in the firm's overall capital markets activities?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan's securities purchased under resale agreements are a key component of its capital markets activities, with a balance of $7.1 billion at December 31, 2023, as reported in the detailed breakdown of securities financing agreements. These agreements contributed to cash flow dynamics in 2023, where a decrease in these agreements provided cash, contrasting with 2022 when an increase used cash. From a risk management perspective, JPMorgan mitigates credit exposure through collateral monitoring and master netting agreements, particularly important given that these agreements expose the firm to credit risk if the value of received securities falls below the cash advanced. Additionally, the firm has elected the fair value option for certain resale agreements, meaning changes in fair value are reported in principal transactions revenue, aligning their treatment with market-sensitive instruments. Together, these elements show that resale agreements are strategically used to finance inventory, deploy excess cash, and support client needs, while being actively managed for liquidity and credit risk.",

      "question": "How does JPMorgan Chase's strategic planning process integrate capital risk management in light of its defined capital risk appetite and its role in enabling market-leading business investments during stressed environments?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase's strategic planning process integrates capital risk management by aligning its defined capital risk appetite\u2014focused on maintaining a 'fortress balance sheet'\u2014with its long-term stability goals. The Operating Committee and senior management incorporate capital risk considerations into strategic initiatives, ensuring that sufficient capital is maintained to support business activities during both normal and stressed conditions. This is exemplified by the Firm's internal minimum capital levels, which exceed regulatory requirements, and its emphasis on risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the Firm's Capital Risk Management function monitors capital risk metrics and establishes capital risk limits, which feed directly into strategic decisions, including investments in market-leading businesses during periods of economic stress.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JPM(page_93) \u2192 Capital Risk Management: JPM defines capital risk as the risk of having an insufficient level or composition of capital to support business activities during normal and stressed conditions. The Firm's capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable investment in market-leading businesses, even in highly stressed environments. Specific metrics include internal minimum capital levels that exceed regulatory requirements and a strong capital governance framework.",
        "Hop 2: JPM(page_47) \u2192 Capital Risk Management: Capital Risk Management is listed as a key section within the Firm's financial reporting and risk management structure, indicating its central role in both audited financial statements and broader risk oversight. This underscores its importance in aligning capital risk with financial reporting and strategic governance.",
        "Hop 3: JPM(page_92) \u2192 Capital Risk Management: Capital risk is integrated into strategic risk management through the Firm's balance sheet strategy, which emphasizes risk-adjusted returns, strong capital, and robust liquidity. The strategic planning process includes capital considerations as part of budgeting, risk appetite, and earnings objectives, with Capital Risk Management referenced as a key supporting function."

      "answer": "The net benefit from credit loss provisions in 2022 was primarily driven by reserve releases, which contrasted with reserve builds in the prior year. These reserve releases were attributed to improved portfolio quality and a more favorable macroeconomic outlook, especially improvements in unemployment rate projections. This was partially offset by increases in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans. Under the CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, American Express is required to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience and current as well as future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period), which is approximately three years. Additionally, the company uses models like Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and recovery models to estimate expected losses, and these models were influenced by the improved economic outlook and changes in portfolio characteristics such as delinquency status and credit bureau scores.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NOTE 3\n\n## RESERVES FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\nReserves for credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date. The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&amp;S Period), which is approximately three years, beyond the balance sheet date. We make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses.\n\nWe use a combination of statistically-based models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the R&amp;S Period. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models: Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and future recoveries for each month of the R&amp;S Period. Beyond the R&amp;S Period, we estimate expected credit losses by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates.\n\n- PD models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be written-off.\n- EAD models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of write-off. This includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior, which vary by customer. Due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios, the EAD models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors.\n- Recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from Card Members after default occurs, typically as a result of collection efforts. Future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default, time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions.\n\nWe also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions, even if such expected recoveries exceed expected losses. Our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses.\n\nFuture economic conditions that are incorporated over the R&amp;S Period include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party. Management reviews these economic scenarios each period and applies judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product (GDP), that are significant to our models.\n\nWe also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. We consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves (higher or lower) to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions.\n\nLifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity, including assessment on a pooled basis where financial assets share similar risk characteristics, such as past spend and remittance behaviors, credit bureau scores where available, delinquency status, tenure of balance outstanding, amongst others. Credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of Reserves for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and within the Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than reversing interest income. Separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring, which are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model. See Note 2 for information on troubled debt restructurings.\n\nLoans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible, which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than 180 days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and 120 days past due for term loans. Loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon notification.\n\nResults for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2020 are presented using the CECL methodology, while information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 continues to be reported in accordance with the incurred loss methodology then in effect. Reserves for credit losses under the incurred loss methodology were primarily based upon statistical and analytical models that analyzed portfolio performance and reflected management's judgments regarding the quantitative components of the reserve.

We also extend credit to consumer and commercial customers through non-card financing products, resulting in Other loans. Reserves for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2020 are presented using the CECL methodology, while information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 continues to be reported in accordance with the incurred loss methodology then in effect.\n\n## CARD MEMBER AND OTHER LOANS\n\nCard Member loans are generally recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant and represent revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any finance charges and associated card-related fees. Card Members with outstanding revolving loans are required to make a minimum monthly payment and the balances that Card Members choose to revolve are subject to finance charges. These loans have varying terms such as credit limits, interest rates, fees and payment structures, which can be revised over time based on new information about Card Members, and in accordance with applicable regulations and the respective product's terms and conditions.\n\nCard Member loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses (refer to Note 3), and include principal and any related accrued interest and fees. Our policy generally is to cease accruing interest on a Card Member loan at the time the account is written off, and establish reserves for interest that we believe will not be collected.\n\nOther loans are recorded at the time any extension of credit is provided to consumer and commercial customers for non-card financing products. These loans have a range of fixed terms such as interest rates, fees and repayment periods. Borrowers are typically required to make pre-established monthly payments over the term of the loan. Non-card financing products are not associated with a Card Member agreement, and instead are governed by a separate borrowing relationship. Other loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses, and include principal and any related accrued interest and fees.\n\nCard Member loans by segment and Other loans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of:\n\n",

The reserve releases in the current year were due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by increases in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans. The reserve builds in the prior year were due to the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreases in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans.",

      "question": "How does American Express's exposure to regulatory uncertainty regarding cobrand relationships in the EU and UK, as well as the financial health of these partners, combine with the strategic importance of cobrand portfolios (which represented 40% of global Card Member loans as of 2021), to shape the overall risk profile and competitive positioning of the company?",
      "answer": "American Express faces a complex risk environment around its cobrand partners, shaped by regulatory uncertainty in the EU and UK, the financial health of these partners, and the strategic weight these relationships carry in its global portfolio. The regulatory landscape in the EU and UK introduces uncertainty around the future of cobrand and agent arrangements, potentially affecting contract terms and the company's ability to maintain these partnerships (page_34). This regulatory risk is compounded by the fact that cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 40% of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2021 (page_27), making them a critical component of the company's lending and revenue base. Additionally, the financial condition of cobrand partners\u2014such as airlines or retail brands\u2014could materially affect American Express if those partners face bankruptcies, restructurings, or consolidations (page_92). The combination of regulatory exposure, strategic portfolio weight, and counterparty risk creates a multi-dimensional challenge that could significantly impact American Express\u2019s competitive positioning, profitability, and operational flexibility.",

We have and may continue to experience increased costs related to compensation and other benefits necessary to attract and retain qualified personnel. Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations or other changes in the legal or regulatory environment, including as a result of the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit), can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to employ colleagues in the location(s) of our choice. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB are subject to review and oversight by the OCC. This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. Our inability to attract and retain highly skilled, motivated and diverse personnel could materially adversely affect our business and our culture.\n\n## Our operations, business, customers and partners could be materially adversely affected by climate change.\n\nThere  are  increasing  and  rapidly  evolving  concerns  over  the  risks  of  climate  change  and  related  environmental  sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. Such events and disasters could disrupt our operations or the  operations  of  customers  or  third  parties  on  which  we  rely  and  could  result  in  market  volatility  or  negatively  impact  our customers' spending behaviors or ability to pay outstanding loans. Additionally, we may face risks related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could increase expenses or otherwise adversely impact our business, our customers and partners. We could also experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation and changes to our technology, operations, products and services, as well as reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence, due to our response to climate change and our efforts relating to the Advancing Climate Solutions pillar of our ESG strategy.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\n\n## Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, which significantly affects our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance efforts. Supervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies, compromise our competitive position, and affect our relationships with Card Members, partners, merchants, service providers and other third parties. New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase our costs of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\n\nIn preparation for the completion of Brexit, numerous EU laws and regulations were separately adopted into UK domestic legislation in order to ensure continuity. However, the UK plans to evaluate the extent to which these EU-legacy laws and regulations should change going forward and has already indicated some areas where it may take a different approach from the EU. To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts, as well as potential regulatory enforcement actions and penalties.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital.\n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU and the UK.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Delta, Marriott, Hilton and British Airways, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including Delta and others in the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member participants. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 19 percent of our worldwide network volumes for the year ended December 31, 2021. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 40 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2021.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships. Network volumes could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion and Platinum Card Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition' for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU and the UK. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. We face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 12 to our 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners.",

When we work with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but such third parties may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards, and readiness efforts for returning to our offices may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Delta, Marriott, Hilton and British Airways, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including Delta and others in the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member participants. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 19 percent of our worldwide network volumes for the year ended December 31, 2021. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 40 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2021.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships. Network volumes could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion and Platinum Card Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition' for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU and the UK. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. We face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 12 to our 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners.",

      "question": "How does American Express's use of asset securitizations in its funding strategy align with its balance sheet reporting and the defined role of securitized trusts in its financial structure?",
      "answer": "American Express utilizes asset securitizations as a key component of its funding strategy, as noted in the Funding Programs and Activities section, where it references the role of securitized trusts in financing its global card-issuing businesses. Specifically, the securitized loans and receivables from the Lending Trust and Charge Trust are reported as assets, with the corresponding securities issued by these trusts listed as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (page 97). This aligns with the definition provided in the glossary (page 88), which explains that asset securitizations involve transferring receivables to a special-purpose trust that issues asset-backed securities to fund the purchase price. The integration of these trusts into the balance sheet and their strategic role in funding reflects a structured financial mechanism that supports American Express\u2019s liquidity and funding diversification.",

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAverage discount rate This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with network volumes, drive our discount revenue.\n\nBilled business - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express. Billed business is reported as inside the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.\n\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' for further related definitions under Basel III.\n\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\n\nCard Member loans - Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\n\nCard Member receivables - Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date.\n\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\n\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member's most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n\nCobrand cards - Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner's own loyalty program.\n\nCredit cards - Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.\n\nDiscount revenue - Primarily represents the amount earned on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, a GNS partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members.",

Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.\n\nOur global proprietary card-issuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. In addition, we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities.\n\nWe aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits, and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility.\n\nOur direct retail deposits have become a larger proportion of our funding over time. We expect the balance of these deposits to continue to grow. Our funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth, our liquidity position, and choice of funding sources, as well as cash requirements generated by the redemptions of deposits by our customers, the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments. In executing our funding plan, we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term refinancing requirements.\n\n## FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES\n\nWe had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of December 31:\n\n## TABLE 17: SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT\n\n",

      "question": "How might regulatory pressures on discount rate negotiations impact American Express's profitability, considering the role of GNS partners in merchant coverage expansion and the variable nature of discount revenue tied to merchant mix and global acceptance agreements?",
      "answer": "Regulatory pressures could constrain American Express's ability to negotiate favorable discount rates with merchants, which directly affects discount revenue. According to page 104, discount revenue varies based on merchant industry, transaction volume, and global acceptance agreements, and is a core revenue stream. Page 91 notes that GNS partners play a key role in expanding merchant coverage, which affects how widely Amex cards are accepted and thus the volume of transactions. If regulatory constraints limit the ability to offer competitive incentives or negotiate favorable terms with merchants, this could reduce the attractiveness of the Amex network to both merchants and card members. Page 92 further indicates that such regulatory developments could exert pressure on the average discount rate and GNS business, which, when combined with the variable nature of discount revenue and dependence on partner networks, could negatively impact profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

      "answer": "MetLife's treatment of OLPI investments shows a nuanced approach to valuation and risk management. On page 269, the company explains that OLPI is included in the assets whose fair value approximates carrying value, based on the value of underlying assets like derivatives and hedge funds, and that their valuation can be affected by unobservable inputs requiring management judgment. On page 267, OLPI is explicitly excluded from the fair value hierarchy and is instead measured using the NAV practical expedient, with a fair value of $52 million at the end of 2023. This suggests a more simplified or indirect valuation method compared to other Level 1 or Level 2 assets. Finally, on page 247, the historical data reveals a significant decline in OLPI's value from $4,927 million in 2021 to $454 million in 2023, indicating a major reduction in exposure or write-down. Together, these perspectives suggest that OLPI is a volatile and complex investment category that MetLife treats with caution, using conservative valuation methods and reducing exposure over time in response to performance trends.",

      "question": "How does the pattern of permitted versus actual capital distributions to MET from Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company in 2023 and 2024 compare with the company's credit ratings, and what does this reveal about MET's capital management flexibility relative to its other insurance subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company paid $189 million to MET, and for 2024, it is permitted to distribute up to $373 million without regulatory approval. This pattern is consistent with MET's other major subsidiaries like Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which had a much larger 2024 permitted distribution of $3,476 million. When compared with credit ratings, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company holds strong ratings across agencies\u2014A+ from A.M. Best, AA- from Fitch, Aa3 from Moody\u2019s, and AA- from S&P\u2014similar to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. This suggests that, although Metropolitan Tower Life has a smaller capital base relative to other subsidiaries, it maintains a strong credit profile that supports its ability to make capital distributions, albeit on a smaller scale. This reflects MET's broader capital management strategy of leveraging multiple subsidiaries with varying distribution capacities, all underpinned by solid credit ratings.",

      "question": "What is the total exposure to Foreign Corporate Securities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, and how does MetLife value these securities compared to Level 2, given the inputs and methodologies disclosed?",
      "answer": "MetLife reports $14,631 million in Foreign Corporate Securities within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023. These securities are primarily valued using the market approach, with key inputs including independent non-binding broker quotations, quoted prices in less active markets, and credit spreads. In contrast, Foreign Corporate Securities in Level 2 ($40,813 million) are valued using more observable inputs such as benchmark yields, spreads off benchmark yields, issuer ratings, and trades of identical or comparable securities. The Level 3 valuation also incorporates delta spread adjustments for specific credit-related issues, indicating higher subjectivity and complexity in pricing these securities compared to Level 2, where market observability is higher.",

        "Hop 1: MetLife (page_276) \u2192 Foreign Corporate Securities: Discloses that Foreign Corporate Securities are included within the fair value rollforward and are part of the broader category of fixed maturity securities measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in net income or AOCI.",
        "Hop 2: MetLife (page_268) \u2192 Foreign Corporate Securities: Details valuation methodologies for Foreign Corporate Securities in Level 2 and Level 3, showing that Level 3 securities rely more heavily on unobservable inputs such as credit spreads and broker quotations.",

      "question": "How does MetLife position Variable Life Insurance both as a standalone product with investment flexibility and guarantees, and within its broader life insurance and retirement portfolio?",
      "answer": "MetLife positions Variable Life Insurance as a standalone product by emphasizing its investment flexibility and guarantees, allowing policyholders to direct premiums into a variety of separate account investment options or the general account, with certain guarantees protecting the death benefit from adverse investment experience (page_10). Within its broader life insurance offerings, Variable Life Insurance is grouped alongside Whole, Term, Universal, and Group Life Insurance, highlighting its role as a diversified life insurance solution (page_12). When viewed in the broader portfolio context, Variable Life Insurance is positioned as part of a suite of products historically marketed to individuals through retail distribution channels, aligning it with Universal and Term Life Insurance and distinguishing it from group-focused offerings (page_13). This multi-faceted positioning underscores its dual role as both a flexible investment-linked insurance product and a core component of MetLife\u2019s individual life insurance portfolio.",

In certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the Company's general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Contractholders may also elect certain minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees are charged and where asset allocation restrictions may apply. |\n| Fixed and Indexed- Linked Annuities         | Fixed annuities provide for asset accumulation and asset distribution needs.

Fixed income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant. Additionally, the Company has issued indexed-linked annuities which allow the contractholder to participate in returns from equity indices.                                                                                                         |\n| Long-term Care                              | Protection against the potentially high costs of long-term health care services.

Derivatives (continued)\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency exchange rate derivatives, including foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards, currency options and exchange-traded currency futures, to reduce the risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of its net investments in foreign operations.\n\nIn  a  foreign  currency  swap  transaction,  the  Company  agrees  with  another  party  to  exchange,  at  specified  intervals,  the difference between one currency and another at a fixed exchange rate, generally set at inception, calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. The notional amount of each currency is exchanged at the inception and termination of the currency swap  by  each  party.  The  Company  utilizes  foreign  currency  swaps  in  fair  value,  cash  flow  and  nonqualifying  hedging relationships.\n\nIn  a  foreign  currency  forward  transaction,  the  Company  agrees  with  another  party  to  deliver  a  specified  amount  of  an identified currency at a specified future date. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is  made  at  the  specified  future  date.  The  Company  utilizes  foreign  currency  forwards  in  fair  value,  NIFO  hedges  and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nThe Company enters into currency options that give it the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign currency exchange rate and the strike price. The Company uses currency options to hedge against the foreign currency exposure inherent in certain of its variable annuity products. The Company also uses currency options  as  an  economic  hedge  of  foreign  currency  exposure  related  to  the  Company's  non-U.S.  subsidiaries.  The  Company utilizes currency options in NIFO hedges and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nTo a lesser extent, the Company uses exchange-traded currency futures to hedge currency mismatches between assets and liabilities,  and  to  hedge  minimum  guarantees  embedded  in  certain  variable  annuity  products  issued  by  the  Company.  The Company utilizes exchange-traded currency futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\n## Credit Derivatives\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  purchased  credit  default  swaps  to  hedge  against  credit-related  changes  in  the  value  of  its investments. In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a premium to hedge credit risk. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. Credit events vary by type of issuer but typically include bankruptcy, failure to pay debt obligations and involuntary restructuring for corporate obligors, as well  as  repudiation,  moratorium  or  governmental  intervention  for  sovereign  obligors.  In  each  case,  payout  on  a  credit  default swap is triggered only after the relevant third party, Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee determines that a credit event has occurred. The Company utilizes credit default swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nThe Company enters into written credit default swaps to synthetically create credit investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and one or more cash instruments,  such  as  U.S.  government  and  agency,  or  other  fixed  maturity  securities AFS. These  credit  default  swaps  are  not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nThe Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the Company  designates  these  transactions  as  credit  forwards.  The  Company  utilizes  credit  forwards  in  cash  flow  hedging relationships.\n\n## Equity Derivatives\n\nThe  Company  uses  a  variety  of  equity  derivatives  to  reduce  its  exposure  to  equity  market  risk,  including  equity  index options, equity variance swaps, exchange-traded equity futures and equity total return swaps.",

Derivatives (continued)\n\nEquity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the  underlying  equity  index  within  a  limited  time  at  a  contracted  price.  The  contracts  will  be  net  settled  in  cash  based  on differentials  in  the  indices  at  the  time  of  exercise  and  the  strike  price.  Certain  of  these  contracts  may  also  contain  settlement provisions  linked  to  interest  rates.  In  certain  instances,  the  Company  may  enter  into  a  combination  of  transactions  to  hedge adverse changes in equity indices within a pre-determined range through the purchase and sale of options. The Company utilizes equity index options in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nEquity  variance  swaps  are  used  by  the  Company  primarily  to  hedge  minimum  guarantees  embedded  in  certain  variable annuity  products  issued  by  the  Company.  In  an  equity  variance  swap,  the  Company  agrees  with  another  party  to  exchange amounts in the future, based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nIn exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of equity securities, to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal  to  the  difference  in  the  daily  market  values  of  those  contracts  and  to  pledge  initial  margin  based  on  futures  exchange requirements. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity  products  issued  by  the  Company.  The  Company  utilizes  exchange-traded  equity  futures  in  nonqualifying  hedging relationships.\n\nIn  an  equity  total  return  swap,  the  Company  agrees  with  another  party  to  exchange,  at  specified  intervals,  the  difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and a benchmark interest rate, calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. The Company uses equity total return swaps to hedge its equity market guarantees in certain of its insurance products. Equity total return swaps can be used as hedges or to synthetically create investments. The Company utilizes equity total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, we analyze interest rate risk using various models, including multi-scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments, including derivatives. These projections involve evaluating  the  potential  gain  or  loss  on  most  of  our  in-force  business  under  various  increasing  and  decreasing  interest  rate environments. The NYDFS regulations require that we perform some of these analyses annually as part of our review of the sufficiency  of  our  regulatory  reserves.  For  several  of  our  legal  entities,  we  maintain  segmented  operating  and  surplus  asset portfolios  for  the  purpose  of ALM  and  the  allocation  of  investment  income  to  product  lines.  In  the  U.S.,  for  each  segment, invested  assets  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  GAAP  liabilities  net  of  certain  non-invested  assets  allocated  to  the  segment  are maintained,  with  any  excess  allocated  to  Corporate  &amp;  Other.  The  business  segments  may  reflect  differences  in  legal  entity, statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration, liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets. Certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities. We measure relative sensitivities of the value of our assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing internal models. These models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality, morbidity and interest crediting rates.  In  addition,  these  models  include  asset  cash  flow  projections  reflecting  interest  payments,  sinking fund payments, principal payments, bond calls, mortgage loan prepayments and defaults.\n\nWe employ product design, pricing and ALM strategies to reduce the potential effects of interest rate movements. Product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset crediting rates for certain products. ALM strategies include the use of derivatives. We also use reinsurance to mitigate interest rate risk.\n\nWe also  use  common  industry  metrics,  such  as  duration  and  convexity,  to  measure  the  relative  sensitivity  of  assets  and liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the duration of liabilities, we consider all policyholder guarantees and how we intend to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends. Each asset portfolio or portfolio group has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets, we may support such liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or interest rate curve mismatch strategies.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Management\n\nMetLife  has  a  well-established  policy  to  manage  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  exposures  within  its  risk  tolerance.  In general, investments backing specific liabilities are currency matched. This is achieved through direct investments in matching currency or through the use of foreign currency exchange rate derivatives. Enterprise foreign currency exchange rate risk limits are established by the ERC. Management of each of our segments, with oversight from our FX Working Group and the ALM committee for the respective segment, is responsible for managing any foreign currency exchange rate exposure.\n\nWe use foreign currency swaps, forwards and options to mitigate the liability exposure, risk of loss and financial statement volatility associated with our investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and the sale of certain insurance products.\n\n## Equity Market Risk Management\n\nWe manage equity market risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our ALM strategies, including the dynamic hedging with derivatives of certain variable annuity guarantee benefits, as well as reinsurance, in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to large risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We also manage equity market risk exposure in our investment  portfolio  through  the  use  of  derivatives.  These  derivatives  include  exchange-traded  equity  futures,  equity  index options  contracts,  TRRs  and  equity  variance  swaps.  This  risk  is  managed  by  our  ALM  Department  in  partnership  with  the Investments Department.",

Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities.

We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\n\nIf  there were a 1% increase in the global effective income tax rate, the change would have resulted in an approximate $411 million increase in the deferred income tax liabilities balance at December 31, 2021.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\n\n## Litigation Contingencies\n\nWe are a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations.

Liabilities  related  to  certain  lawsuits,  including  our  asbestosrelated  liability,  are  especially  difficult  to  estimate  due  to  the  limitation  of  reliable  data  and  uncertainty  regarding  numerous variables  that  can  affect  liability  estimates.  On  a  quarterly  and  annual  basis,  we  review  relevant  information  with  respect  to liabilities  for  litigation,  regulatory  investigations  and  litigation-related  contingencies  to  be  reflected  in  our  consolidated  financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases,  or  the  use  of  different  assumptions  in  the  determination  of  amounts  recorded  could  have  a  material  effect  upon  our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\n\nSee  Note  21 of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional  information  regarding  our  assessment  of litigation contingencies.\n\n## Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Pending Ownership Increase of PNB MetLife\n\nIn October 2021, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire approximately 15.0% ownership in PNB MetLife India Insurance Company Limited ('PNB MetLife'). Upon completion of the transaction, the Company's ownership in PNB MetLife,  an  operating  joint  venture  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method,  will  increase  to  approximately  47.0%.  The transaction  will  close  upon  receipt  of  all  necessary  regulatory  approvals  and  satisfaction  of  other  closing  conditions.  This transaction  supports  the  Company's  continued  growth  in  India  and  will  enable  us  to  deliver  more  value  for  our  customers, partners and shareholders.\n\n## Acquisition of Versant Health\n\nFor  information  regarding  the  Company's  December  2020  acquisition  of  Versant  Health,  see  Note  3  of  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Acquisition of PetFirst\n\nIn January 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of PetFirst Healthcare, LLC ('PetFirst'), a fast-growing pet health insurance administrator.\n\n## Dispositions\n\n## Pending Disposition of MetLife Poland and Disposition of MetLife Greece\n\nFor information regarding the Company's pending disposition of MetLife Poland and disposition of MetLife Greece, reported as held-for-sale, see Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Disposition of MetLife Seguros\n\nFor information regarding the Company's September 2021 disposition of MetLife Seguros, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Acquisition and Dispositions (continued)\n\nTotal revenue of Versant Health represented less than 2% of pro forma total revenue of MetLife for each of the years ended December 31,  2020  and  2019  when  evaluated  as  though  the  acquisition  had  occurred  at  the  beginning  of  the  earliest  period presented.\n\n## Dispositions\n\n## Disposition of MetLife Seguros S.A.\n\nIn September 2021, the Company sold its wholly-owned Argentinian subsidiary, MetLife Seguros S.A. ('MetLife Seguros'). In connection with the sale, a loss of $205 million, net of income tax, was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is reflected in net investment gains (losses). At December 31, 2020, MetLife Seguros represented $201 million of total assets in the Latin America segment. MetLife Seguros results of operations are reported in the Latin America segment adjusted earnings through the date of sale.\n\n## Pending Disposition of MetLife Poland and Disposition of MetLife Greece\n\nIn July 2021, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Poland and Greece (collectively, 'MetLife Poland and Greece') to NN Group N.V. for $738 million in total consideration, including a pre-closing dividend of $43 million. In connection with the pending sale, an expected loss of $214 million, net of income tax, was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is reflected in net investment gains (losses). MetLife Poland and Greece results of operations are reported in the EMEA segment adjusted earnings through June 30, 2021. See Note 2 for information on accounting for  divested  business.  In  January  2022,  the  Company  completed  the  sale  of  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  in  Greece.  The Company expects the disposition of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Poland to close in the first half of 2022 and is subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\n\nMetLife Poland and Greece met the criteria in the second quarter of 2021 to be classified as held-for-sale but did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the related assets and liabilities are included in the separate heldfor-sale line items of the asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities held-for-sale:\n\n",

Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued)\n\n## Derivative Demands\n\nThe  MetLife,  Inc.  Board  of  Directors  received  six  letters,  dated  March  28,  2018,  May  11,  2018,  July  16,  2018, December 20, 2018, February 5, 2019, and April 7, 2020, written on behalf of individual stockholders, demanding that MetLife, Inc.  take  action  against  current  and  former  directors  and  officers  for  alleged  breaches  of  fiduciary  duty  and/or  investigate, remediate,  and  recover  damages  allegedly  suffered  by  the  Company  as  a  result  of  (i)  the  Company's  allegedly  inadequate practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits, (ii) the Company's allegedly inadequate internal controls over financial reporting and corporate governance practices and procedures, and (iii) the alleged dissemination of false or misleading information related to these issues. The MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors appointed a special committee to investigate the allegations set forth in these six letters.\n\n## Commitments\n\n## Mortgage Loan Commitments\n\nThe Company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan commitments. The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were $4.6 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Commitments to Fund Partnership Investments, Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private Corporate Bond Investments\n\nThe Company commits to fund partnership investments and to lend funds under bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts of these unfunded commitments were $9.1 billion and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of  its  business,  the  Company  has  provided  certain  indemnities,  guarantees  and  commitments  to  third parties such that it may be required to make payments now or in the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition, investment and other transactions, the Company has provided indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax, environmental and other specific  liabilities  and  other  indemnities  and  guarantees  that  are  triggered  by,  among  other  things,  breaches  of  representations, warranties  or  covenants  provided  by  the  Company.  In  addition,  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as third-party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than $1 million to $329 million, with a cumulative maximum of $640 million, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations  are  not  subject  to  limitations,  the  Company  does  not  believe  that  it  is  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or commitments.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company's interests. Since these indemnities are  generally  not  subject  to  limitation  with  respect  to  duration  or  amount,  the  Company  does  not  believe  that  it  is  possible  to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future.\n\nThe Company also has minimum fund yield requirements on certain pension funds. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future.\n\nThe Company's recorded liabilities were $20 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 for indemnities, guarantees and commitments.\n\n## 22.

      "question": "How does Mastercard's acquisition of Recorded Future impact its financial reporting scope, goodwill valuation, and deferred revenue dynamics, and what does this reveal about the integration and strategic importance of Recorded Future within Mastercard's broader business model?",
      "answer": "Mastercard's acquisition of Recorded Future in December 2024 excluded the subsidiary from the internal control assessment, with its assets and revenues representing approximately 1% and less than 1%, respectively, of consolidated financial statement amounts. The acquisition also contributed to an increase in the carrying amount of goodwill, which Mastercard assessed qualitatively and concluded was not impaired as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, the acquisition was a primary driver of the increase in deferred revenue during 2024. Together, these points indicate that while Recorded Future is not yet deeply integrated into Mastercard's financial control framework, it is strategically significant enough to influence goodwill and revenue dynamics, suggesting a phased or ongoing integration process.",

Internal  control  over  financial  reporEng  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporEng  and  the preparaEon of financial statements for external reporEng purposes in accordance with accounEng principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. As required by Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002, management has assessed the effecEveness of Mastercard's internal control over financial reporEng as of December 31, 2024. In making its assessment,  management  has  uElized  the  criteria  set  forth  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  CommiNee  of  Sponsoring OrganizaEons  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO). Management  has  concluded  that,  based  on  its  assessment,  Mastercard's  internal  control  over  financial reporEng was effecEve as of  December 31, 2024.  The effecEveness of Mastercard's internal control over financial reporEng as of  December 31, 2024 has been audited  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  an  independent  registered  public  accounEng  firm,  as  stated  in  their  report  which  appears  on  the  next  page.

This aligns with MA's broader debt strategy, as the company also maintains a $8 billion Commercial Paper Program and a $8 billion revolving Credit Facility expiring in 2029, ensuring liquidity for business continuity and settlement failures.

      "question": "How has Mastercard's Class A Treasury Stock activity evolved from 2019 to 2021, and what does this indicate about the company's capital allocation strategy in light of its overall equity position?",
      "answer": "From 2019 to 2021, Mastercard's Class A Treasury Stock activity shows consistent share repurchases, decreasing the balance from $(32,205) million in 2019 to $(42,588) million by the end of 2021. This indicates a significant ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders through buybacks. The total equity position increased from $5,917 million in 2019 to $7,383 million in 2021, despite the growing negative impact of treasury stock, suggesting strong retained earnings growth and overall profitability. This aligns with a capital allocation strategy that balances aggressive share repurchases with equity growth and financial stability.",

      "answer": "Mastercard's multi-rail payments network underpins its core transaction switching capabilities by authorizing, clearing, and settling payment transactions through its proprietary global network (page_6). This network also extends to ACH transactions, both batch and real-time, enabling the company to offer integrated payment products and services that capture new payment flows (page_46). From a financial structure perspective, the company's consolidated financial statements highlight that its operations are not based on issuing cards or extending credit, but rather on generating revenue through transaction-based fees and value-added services, which are directly tied to the usage and expansion of its multi-rail network (page_71). This aligns with its franchise model that sets standards for interoperability and balances risk and value across stakeholders, reinforcing the strategic importance of the network in driving both operational efficiency and revenue diversification.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Organization\n\nMastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated ('Mastercard International' and together with Mastercard Incorporated, 'Mastercard' or the 'Company'), is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations  worldwide,  enabling  them  to  use  electronic  forms  of  payment  instead  of  cash  and  checks.  The  Company  makes payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services through its family of well-known and  trusted  brands,  including  Mastercard\u00ae,  Maestro\u00ae  and  Cirrus\u00ae.  The  Company  operates  a  multi-rail  payments  network  that provides choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants. Through its unique and proprietary core global payments network, the Company switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions. The Company has additional payment capabilities that include  automated  clearing  house  ('ACH')  transactions  (both  batch  and  real-time  account-based  payments).  Using  these capabilities, the Company offers integrated payment products and services and captures new payment flows. The Company's valueadded services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions to allow all parties to transact easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on Mastercard's principled use of consumer and merchant data. The Company's franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. The Company's payment solutions are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem.\n\nMastercard  is  not  a  financial  institution.  The  Company  does  not  issue  cards,  extend  credit,  determine  or  receive  revenue  from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants' acceptance of the Company's products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the Company's financial institution customers.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nConsolidation and basis of presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majorityowned and controlled  entities,  including  any  variable  interest  entities  ('VIEs')  for  which  the  Company  is  the  primary  beneficiary. Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as marketable,  equity  method  or  measurement  alternative  method  investments  and  recorded  in  other  assets  on  the  consolidated balance sheet.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no significant VIEs which required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates acquisitions as of the date on which the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP').\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the interests. Changes in a parent's ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. For 2021, 2020 and 2019, net losses from non-controlling interests were not material and, as a result, amounts are included on the consolidated statement of operations within other income (expense).\n\nUse of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Future events and their effects  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty;  accordingly,  accounting  estimates  require  the  exercise  of  judgment.  These  financial statements were prepared using information reasonably available as of December 31, 2021 and through the date of this Report. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company's operating environment changes. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRevenue recognition - Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  Company  expects  to  be  entitled  to  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.  Revenue  is primarily  generated  from  assessing  customers  based  on  the  dollar  volume  of  activity,  or  gross  dollar  volume  ('GDV'),  on  the products that carry the Company's brands, from fees to issuers, acquirers and other stakeholders for providing switching services, as well as from value-added products and services that are often integrated and sold with the Company's payment offerings.",

      "answer": "Citigroup's $61 million FRB penalty (page_12) indicates that regulators found ongoing deficiencies in its data quality management program, suggesting compliance gaps persist despite transformation efforts. The company continues to invest significantly in its broader transformation to enhance risk, controls, data, and compliance infrastructure to meet the extensive requirements of the 2020 FRB and OCC Consent Orders (page_62). However, the requirement for Citibank to obtain prior approval for significant new acquisitions highlights operational constraints imposed by the OCC Consent Order, signaling that regulators remain cautious about Citigroup\u2019s ability to manage risk sustainably (page_63). Together, these elements show that while Citigroup is investing heavily in compliance, it continues to face financial penalties and operational restrictions, reflecting both progress and unresolved challenges in fully satisfying the Consent Orders.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMPLIANCE RISKS\n\nSignificantly Heightened Regulatory Expectations and Scrutiny in the U.S. and Globally and Ongoing Interpretation and Implementation of Regulatory and Legislative Requirements and Changes Have Increased Citi's Compliance, Regulatory and Other Risks and Costs.\n\nLarge financial institutions, such as Citi, face significantly heightened regulatory and supervisory expectations and scrutiny in the U.S. and globally, including with respect to, among other things, governance, infrastructure, data and risk management practices and controls. These regulatory and supervisory expectations extend to employees and agents and also include, among other things, those related to customer and client protection, market practices, anti-money laundering, increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure regimes and various regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nU.S. financial institutions also face increased ex pectations and scrutiny in the wake of the failures of several regional banks and other banking stresses in 2023. In addition, Citi is continually required to interpret and implement extensive and frequently changing regulatory and legislative requirements in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which it does business, which may overlap or conflict across jurisdictions, resulting in substantial compliance, regulatory and other risks and costs.\n\nA failure to comply with these expectations and requirements, even if inadvertent, or resolve any identified deficiencies in a timely and sufficiently satisfactory manner to regulators, could result in increased regulatory oversight; material restrictions, including, among others, imposition of additional capital buffers and limitations on capital distributions; enforcement proceedings; penalties; and fines (see the capital return risk factor above and legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below).\n\nMoreover, over the past several years, Citi has been required to implement a large number of regulatory, supervisory and legislative changes, including new regulatory, supervisory or legislative requirements or regimes, across its businesses and functions, and these changes continue. The changes themselves may be complex and subject to interpretation, and result in changes to Citi's businesses. In addition, the changes require continued substantial technology and other investments. In some cases, Citi's implementation of a regulatory or legislative requirement is occurring simultaneously with changing or conflicting regulatory guidance from multiple jurisdictions (including various U.S. states) and regulators, legal challenges or legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact new rules.\n\nExamples of regulatory or legislative changes that have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs include (i) the U.S. regulatory capital framework and requirements, which have continued to evolve (see the capital return risk factor and 'Capital Resources' above); (ii) various laws relating to the limitation of cross-border data movement and/or collection and use of customer information, including data localization and protection and privacy laws, which also can conflict with or increase compliance complexity with respect to other laws, including anti-money laundering laws; and (iii) the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which may overlap but also diverge from climate-related disclosure requirements expected to come into effect in other jurisdictions.\n\nCiti Is Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory Proceedings, Examinations, Investigations, Consent Orders and Related Compliance Efforts and Other Inquiries That Could Result in Large Monetary Penalties, Supervisory or Enforcement Orders, Business Restrictions, Limitations on Dividends, Changes to Directors and/or Officers and Collateral Consequences Arising from Such Outcomes.\n\nCiti's regulators have broad powers and discretion under their prudential and supervisory authority, and have pursued active inspection and investigatory oversight. At any given time, Citi is a party to a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations. Additionally, Citi remains subject to governmental and regulatory investigations, consent orders (see discussion below) and related compliance efforts, and other inquiries. Citi could also be subject to enforcement proceedings and negative regulatory evaluation or examination findings not only because of violations of laws and regulations, but also due to failures, as determined by its regulators, to have adequate policies and procedures, or to remedy deficiencies on a timely basis (see also the capital return and resolution plan risk factors above). Citi could face further scrutiny and consequences from regulators for failing to timely resolve open regulatory issues or having repeat regulatory issues.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the 2020 FRB Consent Order and the 2020 OCC Consent Order require Citigroup and Citibank, respectively, to implement extensive targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient basis detailing the results and status of improvements relating principally to various aspects of enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management related to governance, and internal controls. These improvements will result in continued significant investments by Citi during 2025 and beyond, as an essential part of Citi's broader transformation efforts to enhance its risk, controls, data and finance infrastructure and compliance (see the transformation, simplification and other prioritiesrelated risk factor above).\n\nAdditionally, on July 10, 2024, the FRB entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citigroup, and the OCC entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citibank. The OCC and Citibank also entered into an Amendment to the OCC's 2020 Consent Order (the Amendment). The FRB found that Citigroup had ongoing deficiencies related to its data quality management program and had inadequate measures for managing and controlling its data quality risks. The OCC found that Citibank had failed to make sufficient and sustainable progress toward achieving compliance with its 2020 Consent Order.\n\nThe Amendment requires Citibank to formalize a process to determine whether sufficient resources are being appropriately allocated toward achieving timely and sustainable compliance with the OCC's 2020 Consent Order, including any requirements on which Citibank is not making sufficient and sustainable progress (such process, the Resource Review Plan). There can be no assurance that the Resource",

(For additional information, see 'Citi's Multiyear Transformation' above.)\n\nAlthough there are no restrictions on Citi's ability to serve its clients, the OCC Consent Order requires Citibank to obtain prior approval of any significant new acquisition, including any portfolio or business acquisition, ex cluding ordinary course transactions.\n\nMoreover, the OCC Consent Order provides that the OCC has the right to assess future civil money penalties or take other supervisory and/or enforcement actions. Such actions by the OCC could include imposing business restrictions, including possible additional limitations on the declaration or payment of dividends by Citibank and changes in directors and/or senior executive officers. More generally, the OCC and/or the FRB could again take enforcement or other actions if the regulatory agency believes that Citi has not met regulatory expectations regarding compliance with the consent orders.\n\nThe global judicial, regulatory and political environment has generally been challenging for large financial institutions, which have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. The complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of Citi's operations, also means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and authorities in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in foreign jurisdictions, as well as multiple civil litigation claims in multiple jurisdictions. Violations of law by other financial institutions may also result in regulatory scrutiny of Citi. Responding to regulatory inquiries and proceedings can be time consuming and costly, and divert management attention from Citi's businesses.\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators have been increasingly focused on the culture of financial services firms, including Citi, as well as 'conduct risk,' a term used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents, including third parties, that could harm clients, customers, employees or the integrity of the markets, such as improperly creating, selling, marketing or managing products and services or improper incentive compensation programs with respect thereto, failures to safeguard a party's personal information or failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest.\n\nIn addition to the greater focus on conduct risk, the general heightened scrutiny and expectations from regulators could lead to investigations and other inquiries, as well as remediation requirements, regulatory restrictions, structural changes, more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings, civil litigation and higher compliance and other risks and costs. For additional information, see the capital return and heightened regulatory scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk factors above. Further, while Citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients, customers, employees or the integrity of the markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented.\n\nMoreover, the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which Citi is subject has remained elevated. For ex ample, U.S. and certain non-U.S. governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against, or have sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements from, financial institutions and individual employees. These types of actions by U.S. and other governments may, in the future, have significant collateral consequences for Citi, including loss of customers and business, operational loss and the inability to offer certain products or services and/or operate certain businesses. Citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar types of criminal remedies, consent orders, sanctions, substantial fines and penalties, remediation and other financial costs or other requirements in the future, including for matters or practices not yet known to Citi, any of which could materially and negatively affect Citi's businesses, business practices, financial condition or results of operations, require material changes in Citi's operations or cause Citi substantial reputational harm.\n\nAdditionally, many large claims-both private civil and regulatory-asserted against Citi are highly complex, slow to develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings. Although Citi establishes accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements, Citi's estimates of, and changes to, these accruals involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, and the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued (see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor above). In addition, certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved. Furthermore, regulators may be more likely to pursue investigations or proceedings against financial institutions, such as Citi, that have previously been the subject of other regulatory actions.\n\nFor further information on Citi's legal and regulatory proceedings, see Note 30.\n\n## OTHER RISKS\n\n## Citi's Emerging Markets Presence Subjects It to Various Risks as well as Increased Compliance and Regulatory Risks and Costs.\n\nCiti's presence in the emerging markets subjects it to various risks. During 2024, emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately 28% of Citi's total revenues (based, beginning in 2024, on the IMF and FFIEC classifications, which resulted in the exclusion of certain countries that Citi previously classified as emerging markets).\n\nEmerging market risks include, among others, limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments; foreign currency volatility, including devaluations and strength in the U.S. dollar; central bank interest rate and other monetary policies, including the impact of sustained high interest rates in the U.S.; unemployment, recessions or weak or slowing economic growth; elevated inflation and hyperinflation; foreign ex change controls, including an inability to access indirect foreign ex change mechanisms; macroeconomic,",

The result is a simpler management structure that aligns to and facilitates Citi's strategy, while improving accountability and decision-making. Citi's operating model changes included elimination of the Institutional Clients Group , Personal Banking and Wealth Management and Legacy Franchises operating segments and resulted in the five current reportable operating segmentsServices , Markets , Banking , Wealth and U.S. Personal Banking -and a new financial reporting structure. Activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments are reflected in All Other , including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. Citi also ex ited certain institutional business lines and consolidated its regional structure from four to two regions, consisting of North America and International. Citi's organizational simplification efforts also assist in advancing the ex ecution of the transformation.\n\n## FRB and OCC Consent Orders Compliance\n\nAs previously disclosed, on July 10, 2024, the FRB entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citigroup in the amount of approximately $61 million, and the OCC entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citibank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, in the amount of $75 million. The OCC and Citibank also entered into an Amendment to the October 7, 2020 OCC Consent Order. The Amendment requires Citibank to formalize a process to determine whether sufficient resources are being appropriately allocated toward achieving timely and sustainable compliance with the OCC's 2020 Consent Order, including any requirements on which Citibank is not making sufficient and sustainable progress (such process, the Resource Review Plan). Copies of the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment were included as exhibits to Citi's July 10, 2024 Form 8-K. For additional information regarding the 2024\n\nConsent Orders and the Amendment, see the July 10, 2024 Form 8-K.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi's transformation efforts include effective implementation of the October 7, 2020 FRB and OCC Consent Orders issued to Citigroup and Citibank, respectively. The 2020 Consent Orders require Citigroup and Citibank to implement extensive targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient basis, detailing the results and status of improvements relating principally to various aspects of (i) enterprise-wide risk management, (ii) compliance risk management, (iii) data quality management related to governance, and (iv) internal controls. Citi continues to work constructively with the FRB and OCC and provide additional information regarding its plans and progress to both regulators on an ongoing basis. Citi will continue to reflect their feedback in its project plans and ex ecution efforts. Although there are no restrictions on Citi's ability to serve its clients, the 2020 OCC Consent Order requires Citibank to obtain prior approval of any significant new acquisition, including any portfolio or business acquisition, ex cluding ordinary course transactions. For additional information about the requirements under the 2020 Consent Orders, see Citi's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 9, 2020.\n\n## Governance\n\nCiti has built an organization and infrastructure to manage, guide and support its transformation, which spans all businesses and functions to ensure consistency. Additionally, the Citigroup and Citibank Boards of Directors each formed a Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee of each Board, to provide oversight of Citi's efforts to improve its risk and control environment and management's remediation efforts under the consent orders.\n\nWhile every member of Citi's executive management team, or EMT, is involved in the transformation and plays a key, direct role in its implementation, Citi's CEO has taken a leading role in managing the effort. As part of this effort, Citi's CEO has assembled a team consisting of long-tenured employees and new hires from across various disciplines and areas of expertise and experience, along with representatives from each of Citi's businesses and functions, to lead the various transformation programs. Citi is focusing the Company's most senior talent on this effort and has a detailed, integrated approach to execute on the transformation. Citi's Transformation Steering Committee, chaired by Citi's CEO, sets the overall direction for the transformation and communicates progress to the Citigroup Board of Directors, as well as seeks input and feedback from the Board.\n\nIn 2023, Citi appointed a Chief Operating Officer, who reports to the CEO and is responsible for running Citi's overall transformation efforts, as well as leading Citi's efforts to improve operating efficiency and returns along with Citi's enterprise-wide effort to strengthen its risk and controls and data quality, and modernize infrastructure, while simplifying the Company. In 2024, Citi hired a new Head of Technology and Business Enablement, who reports to the CEO and works closely with Citi's transformation team to drive improvements to data quality and modernize infrastructure, while driving simplification and automation across Citi.",

      "answer": "Citigroup fully and unconditionally guarantees CGMHI's debt securities issued under the Senior Debt Indenture, indicating CGMHI's strategic importance within Citigroup\u2019s capital structure. Despite being a subsidiary, CGMHI maintains its own credit ratings (A+/F1 at Fitch, A2/P-1 at Moody\u2019s, and A/A-1 at S&P), which are relatively strong and likely benefit from Citigroup\u2019s backing. The summarized financial information highlights CGMHI\u2019s distinct financial position within Citigroup\u2019s consolidated operations, suggesting that while CGMHI operates with a degree of independence reflected in its own credit profile, it remains closely integrated into Citigroup\u2019s overall funding and capital strategy.",

(CGMHI), a wholly owned subsidiary, under the Senior Debt Indenture dated as of March 8, 2016, between CGMHI, Citigroup Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. In addition, Citigroup Capital III and Citigroup Capital XIII (collectively, the Capital Trusts), each of which is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., have issued trust preferred securities. Citigroup Inc. has guaranteed the payments due on the trust preferred securities to the ex tent that the Capital Trusts have insufficient available funds to make payments on the trust preferred securities. The guarantee, together with Citigroup Inc.'s other obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities, effectively provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the trust preferred securities (see Note 19). No other subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. guarantees the debt securities issued by CGMHI or the trust preferred securities issued by the Capital Trusts.\n\nSummarized financial information for Citigroup Inc. and CGMHI is presented in the tables below:\n\n## SUMMARIZED INCOME STATEMENT\n\n",

      "question": "How does Bank of America's treatment of the Regulatory Capital Rule in its CET1 and TLAC calculations align with its capital distribution capacity and its liquidity risk management framework, given the differences in buffer requirements and risk-weighted asset methodologies across reporting periods?",
      "answer": "Bank of America applies the Regulatory Capital Rule consistently across its CET1 and TLAC frameworks, but with distinct buffer requirements and risk-weighted asset (RWA) methodologies. In CET1, the regulatory minimum includes a 4.5% base, a G-SIB surcharge (3.0% in 2024), and an SCB buffer (3.2% in 2024), while TLAC requires a minimum of 18% plus a buffer of 2.5% and a G-SIB surcharge of 1.5%. The Corporation's CET1 capital rose to $201.1 billion in 2024, supporting both its capital distributions (e.g., $20.8 billion from BANA) and its well-capitalized status. Meanwhile, the firm maintains a robust liquidity framework, with $23.6 billion in tentative net capital for BofAS and $7.2 billion for MLPF&S, ensuring compliance with both U.S. and European regulatory capital requirements. The alignment of these metrics shows a coordinated capital strategy that supports distributions while managing regulatory and liquidity risks.",

        "Hop 1: [BAC](page_146) \u2192 Regulatory Capital Rule: The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is detailed as the sum of 4.5%, G-SIB surcharge (3.0% in 2024), and SCB buffer (3.2% in 2024). The Corporation received $20.8 billion in dividends from BANA in 2024, indicating capital distribution capacity.",
        "Hop 2: [BAC](page_55) \u2192 Regulatory Capital Rule: TLAC regulatory minimum is outlined as 18.0% plus a 2.5% buffer and a 1.5% G-SIB surcharge. The U.S. broker-dealers (BofAS and MLPF&S) maintain tentative net capital of $23.6 billion and $7.2 billion respectively, exceeding minimums.",

(BofAS)  and  Merrill  L ynch,  Pierce,  Fenner  &amp;  Smith  Incorporated  (MLPF&amp;S).  The Corporation's  principal  European  subsidiaries  undertaking  broker-dealer  activities are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).\n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPF&amp;S computes its  capital  req uirements  in  accordance  with  the  alternative  standard  under  R ule 15c3-1. BofAS is registered as a futures commission merchant and is subject to Commodity F utures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.1 7 . The U.S. brokerdealer  subsidiaries  are  also  registered  with  the  Financial  Industry  Regulatory Authority , Inc. (FINR A). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4 11 0, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of  its  customers'  and  affiliates'  risk-based  margin  in  order  to  meet  its  CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At December 3 1, 202 4, BofAS had tentative net capital of $23.6 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $2 1.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.5 billion.\n\nMLPF&amp;S provides retail services. At December 3 1, 202 4, MLPF&amp;S' regulatory net capital was $7 .2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $155 million.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At December 3 1, 202 4, MLI's capital resources were $33.8 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $11.0 billion.\n\nBofASE, an authorized credit institution with its head office located in F rance, is regulated by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le\n\nPrudentiel  et  de  R\u00e9solution  and  the  Autorit\u00e9  des  March\u00e9s  Financiers,  and supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism by the European Central Bank. At  December  3 1,  202 4,  BofASE's  capital  resources  were  $1 0.9  billion,  which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.3 billion.\n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE remained conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based  swap  dealers,  and  maintained  net  liquid  assets  at  December  3 1, 2024 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act. The entities are also registered as swap dealers with the CFTC and met applicable capital requirements at December 31, 2024.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\n## Funding and Liquidity Risk Management\n\nOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements,  commitments  to  extend  credit  and  customer  deposit  withdrawals, while  continuing  to  support  our  businesses  and  customers  under  a  range  of economic conditions. T o achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk  under  expected  and  stressed  conditions,  maintain  liquidity  and  access  to diverse  funding  sources,  including  our  stable  deposit  base,  and  seek  to  align liq uid ity-re la te d   ince ntiv e s  a nd   risks.  Th e se   liq uid ity  risk  m a na ge m e nt  p ra ctice s have  allowed  us  to  effectively  manage  market  fluctuations  from  the  elevated interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and changes in the macroeconomic environment.\n\n",

      "answer": "Bank of America, as an Advanced approaches institution under Basel 3, must report risk-based capital ratios using both Standardized and Advanced approaches, with the lower ratio determining capital adequacy under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation must maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0% plus a 2.0% buffer to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, while its insured depository subsidiaries, including BANA, must maintain a 6.0% SLR to be considered well capitalized. BANA met the well-capitalized definition under PCA for both 2024 and 2023, indicating compliance with Basel 3 capital adequacy rules and alignment with the stricter SLR thresholds.",

      "answer": "Mastercard consistently positions digital identity capabilities as a strategic investment across its business model, financial reporting, and operational priorities. In its business overview (page 6), the company explicitly states that investments in new networks like digital identity capabilities support and strengthen its payments and services solutions. This strategic framing is reinforced in the MD&A section (page 49), which reiterates the importance of digital identity capabilities as part of its value-added services and emphasizes their role in enhancing secure transactions. From a financial reporting perspective (page 75), the company's accounting policies reflect its investment approach, noting that such capabilities are part of its broader investments in new networks, which are integral to its consolidated operations. The alignment across these sections indicates that digital identity capabilities are not only a strategic priority but also a financially integrated component of Mastercard\u2019s evolving payments ecosystem.",

      "question": "How does Schwab's 2023 IDA agreement with TD Depository Institutions reflect both its strategic capital management and its contractual obligations, especially considering the agreement's impact on off-balance sheet treatment of client deposits and its service fee structure?",
      "answer": "Schwab's 2023 IDA agreement enables the company to sweep certain brokerage client deposits off-balance sheet to TD Depository Institutions, which supports its capital management strategy by reducing balance sheet pressure and preserving capital for potential returns to shareholders. This aligns with Schwab's discussion on page 59, where it notes that its capital management includes the potential migration of IDA balances to its balance sheet in the future, contingent on sufficient capital levels. On page 56, the IDA agreement is referenced in the context of contractual obligations, highlighting how the off-balance sheet treatment affects Schwab\u2019s liquidity commitments and structured financial arrangements. Additionally, page 4 explains that the 2023 IDA agreement replaced the 2019 version and maintained the service fee at 15 basis points, indicating continuity in revenue generation from this arrangement while managing client cash efficiently. Together, these perspectives show how the IDA agreement supports Schwab's capital efficiency, contractual liquidity positioning, and operational revenue model.",

The Company's integration of Ameritrade is now complete. Through the integration, the Company generally adopted Schwab platforms and systems, though we've leveraged certain material advantages in Ameritrade's platforms, including our comprehensive integration of Ameritrade's thinkorswim  and thinkpipes trading platforms, education, and tools into our offerings for retail and RIA clients. In 2023, we launched Schwab Trading Powered by Ameritrade\u2122, an enhanced trading experience made possible by the combination of the thinkorswim trading platform with Schwab's trading capabilities on Schwab.com and Schwab Mobile. We have also incorporated Ameritrade Institutional's customizable portfolio rebalancing solution, iRebal , as part of our offering for independent advisor clients. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOver the course of five client transition groups in 2023 and 2024, we converted approximately $1.9 trillion in client assets across more than 17 million client accounts, including 7,000 RIAs, from Ameritrade to Schwab. In May 2024, the Company completed the conversion of the final Ameritrade client transition group to the Schwab platform. Following the completion of the final client account conversions to CS&amp;Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC submitted Uniform Requests for Broker-Dealer Withdrawal (BDW) to terminate their registration as broker-dealers with the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), and other applicable regulatory organizations, and as of December 31, 2024, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC are no longer registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and FINRA.\n\nFor additional information on our integration of Ameritrade, see Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) - Overview and Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Item 8) - Note 16.\n\n## IDA Agreement\n\nConcurrently with the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 24, 2019, as amended (the Merger Agreement) to acquire Ameritrade, CSC entered into an amended and restated insured deposit account agreement with TD Bank USA, National Association and TD Bank, National Association (together, the TD Depository Institutions) (the 2019 IDA agreement), which became effective October 6, 2020. On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the Second Amended and Restated Insured Deposit Account Agreement (2023 IDA agreement) with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the 2019 IDA agreement. Consistent with the 2019 IDA agreement, in accordance with the 2023 IDA agreement, cash held in eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Under the 2023 IDA agreement, the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions remains at 15 basis points, as it was in the 2019 IDA agreement.\n\nFor additional information on the 2023 IDA agreement, see Part II - Item 7 - Capital Management and Item 8 - Note 15.",

      "question": "How does the evolution of Charles Schwab's Managed Investing Solutions, previously referred to as Advice Solutions, reflect both its financial performance and the complexity of its revenue recognition systems, particularly given the audit challenges related to its automated processing of low-dollar, high-volume transactions?",
      "answer": "Charles Schwab's Managed Investing Solutions, formerly known as Advice Solutions (as noted in the document), generated $2,129 million in revenue in 2024, showing steady growth from $1,868 million in 2023 and $1,854 million in 2022. This product line is central to the company's asset management and administration fees, which totaled $5,716 million in 2024. However, the financial reporting for these solutions is complicated by the fact that revenue is derived from a high volume of low-dollar transactions processed through multiple, highly automated systems. According to the audit report, this complexity necessitated extensive IT audit procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of revenue recognition, including testing of automated controls, reconciliation of systems to the general ledger, and validation of pricing rules. The renaming of the product line from 'Advice Solutions' to 'Managed Investing Solutions' also signals a potential rebranding or strategic shift in how the company positions this offering in the market. Together, these elements show that while the product is a growing and significant revenue stream, its financial reporting involves substantial operational and audit complexity.",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Asset Management and Administration Fees (AMAF) and Trading Revenue - Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nNet revenues from the third-party mutual funds and managed investing solutions components of AMAF are generated through third-party mutual fund offerings, and fee-based managed investing solutions, respectively. Commissions within trading revenue are generated through fees earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities, options, and certain third-party mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions are made up of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions, and use automated systems to process and record these transactions based on underlying information sourced from multiple systems and contractual terms with individual investors and third-party mutual funds.\n\nGiven that the Company's processes to record revenue from third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions are highly automated and involve multiple systems and databases, auditing these revenue components was complex and challenging due to the extent of audit effort required and involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (IT) necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications, and automated controls.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company's systems to process the third-party mutual funds and managed investing solutions within AMAF, and commissions within trading revenue transactions included the following, among others:\n\n- With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:\n- Identified the significant systems used to process third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue transactions and, using a risk-based approach, tested the relevant general IT controls over each of these systems.\n- Performed testing of automated business controls and system interface controls (including batch processing) within the relevant third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue streams.\n- For a sample of pricing rules, inspected configuration and ascertained that the relevant systems applied appropriate rates and calculated third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue completely and accurately.\n- We tested internal controls within the relevant third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various systems to the Company's general ledger.\n- We created data visualizations to evaluate recorded third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue and evaluate trends in the data.\n- For a sample of third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recognized to contractual agreements and testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue.\n- For a sample of accounts, we tested the accuracy and completeness of assets under management by obtaining independent pricing support and reconciling total positions to third-party statements.\n\n## /s/ DELOITTE &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nDallas, TX\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1976.\n\n- 123 -",

      "question": "How does Schwab's treatment of PALs in credit loss estimation, charge-off policy, and portfolio growth trends collectively reflect the risk profile and strategic importance of PALs in the company's loan portfolio?",
      "answer": "Schwab's treatment of PALs shows a nuanced risk profile: while they apply a strict 90-day charge-off policy for unsecured PAL balances (page_88), nearly all PALs are fully collateralized by securities as of 2024, eliminating the need for a credit loss allowance (page_88). Despite a slight decrease in 2023, PALs have contributed to overall loan portfolio growth driven by client base expansion (page_142). Additionally, PALs are placed on nonaccrual status under specific delinquency thresholds, and charge-offs are taken when uncollectible, impacting the allowance for credit losses (page_77). Together, this indicates that while PALs are strategically important for growth, they are tightly managed through collateral requirements and conservative charge-off practices, which helps maintain their low-risk status.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per S hare Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n\nManagement also estimates a liability for expected credit losses on the Company's commitments to extend credit related to unused HELOCs and commitments to purchase First Mortgages. See Note 15 for additional information on these commitments. The liability is calculated by applying the loss factors described above to the commitments expected to be funded and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for expected credit losses on these commitments and related activity were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\n## Nonaccrual, nonperforming, and impaired loans\n\nFirst Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, including loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. HELOC loans secured by a second lien are placed on non-accrual status if the associated first lien is 90 days or more delinquent, regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful. Loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming assets.\n\n## Loan charge-offs\n\nThe Company charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for credit losses and the loan balance. Our charge-off policy for First Mortgage and HELOC loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or has been discharged in bankruptcy proceedings, regardless of whether the property is in foreclosure, and charge off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated costs to sell. The Company's policy for PALs is to charge off any unsecured balances no later than at 90 days past due.\n\n## Equipment, office facilities, and property\n\nEquipment, office facilities, and property are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is recorded at cost. Equipment, office facilities, and property include certain capitalized costs of acquired or internally developed software. Costs for internally developed software are capitalized when the costs relate to development of approved projects for our internal needs that result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project and postproject activities are ex pensed as incurred. Equipment, office facilities, and property (other than land) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\n",

Although nonaccrual First Mortgages outstanding increased in 2024 compared to 2023, the ratios of the allowance for credit losses to year-end loans and nonaccrual loans decreased primarily due to the decrease in the allowance for credit losses resulting from a decrease in projected loss rates and improved credit quality metrics in the Company's bank loans portfolio in recent years as discussed in Part II - Item 8 - Note 7.\n\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses for bank loans and loans by category as a percentage of total bank loans:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Bank of America's operational risk exposure, particularly in mortgage banking, integrate with its Basel 3 capital adequacy requirements and risk-weighted asset calculations?",
      "answer": "Bank of America's mortgage banking operations expose the company to significant interest rate and market risks, which are actively hedged to manage financial exposure. These operational risks, including model and third-party risks, are factored into the calculation of total risk-weighted assets (RWA) under Basel 3. According to the Basel 3 capital calculation, operational risk contributes to the overall RWA, which in turn affects the Corporation's capital adequacy ratios. At year-end 2023, the Corporation and its primary banking affiliate, BANA, were required to report capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches, with the lower ratio used for assessing capital adequacy. This means that the risks arising from mortgage banking activities influence both the risk profile and the regulatory capital requirements under Basel 3.",

        "Hop 3: [BAC](page_145) \u2192 [Basel 3]: The Corporation and BANA, as Advanced approaches institutions, must maintain minimum capital ratios such as a 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) plus a 2.0% buffer, with capital adequacy determined using the lower of the two Basel 3 approaches."

      "question": "How does Bank of America's phased regulatory capital treatment of CECL adoption, as reflected in its CET1 capital growth, TLAC ratios, and differences between Advanced and Standardized approaches, illustrate the evolving impact of CECL accounting on its capital adequacy and risk-based metrics?",
      "answer": "Bank of America's adoption of the CECL accounting standard is reflected in multiple regulatory capital calculations across different sections of the 10-K. On page 51, CET1 capital increased by $14.9 billion year-over-year, partly due to the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital under the Standardized approach. On page 53, the document explains that TLAC ratios are calculated under a regulatory capital rule that includes a five-year transition period related to CECL adoption, which affects the Corporation's Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt. Meanwhile, page 54 highlights that the Standardized approach yielded higher RWA than the Advanced approach as of December 31, 2023, and that differences in Tier 2 capital treatment are tied to qualifying allowances for credit losses under CECL. Together, these perspectives show that CECL has a material influence on capital ratios, particularly in how credit loss reserves are recognized and transitioned over time, affecting both risk-based and leverage metrics.",

On page 15, the firm highlights exposure to geopolitical risks such as economic sanctions, trade restrictions, and financial crimes in non-U.S. jurisdictions, particularly in emerging markets, which increase the complexity of compliance with KYC requirements. Page 19 outlines the firm\u2019s regulatory obligations, noting that KYC requirements are part of a broader set of anti-money laundering and sanctions-related regulations that require complex operational capabilities and compliance programs. The firm also acknowledges the risk of increased costs and enforcement actions if these programs fail. Page 22 further emphasizes the reputational and regulatory risks tied to KYC, noting that non-compliance could lead to civil and criminal penalties, litigation, and reputational harm, especially in light of evolving interpretations of these laws.

      "question": "How does Bank of America's fair value reporting for Loans Held-for-Sale (LHFS) in the trading and fair value sections compare with the historical performance and cash flow activity of LHFS as disclosed in the loan disclosures, and what does this reveal about the alignment between valuation assumptions and realized outcomes?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reports LHFS at $232 million in fair value on page 160 and $164 million on page 159, indicating variability in valuation across different reporting periods. Meanwhile, page 126 provides a broader context, showing that LHFS totaled $6.0 billion at year-end 2023 and $6.9 billion at year-end 2022, with significant cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of $16.3 billion in 2023. The fair value figures represent a small portion of the total LHFS balance, suggesting that the majority of these loans are accounted for at amortized cost rather than fair value. The difference in valuation methods and the magnitude of realized cash flows imply that fair value estimates may not fully capture the dynamic nature of LHFS performance, highlighting a potential misalignment between modeled assumptions and actual outcomes.",

        "Hop 1: BAC (page_160) \u2192 LHFS: Discloses $232 million in fair value for LHFS, aggregated by product type and calculated using models like Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes.",
