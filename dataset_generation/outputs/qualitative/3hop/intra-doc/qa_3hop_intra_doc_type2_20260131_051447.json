      "answer": "The transfer of $523 million in surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company directly increased the company's liquidity, as noted in the operating cash flows section. However, this transfer also reduced the expected return on plan assets, contributing to an increase in the net periodic pension cost from $45 million in 2024 to an expected $81 million in 2025. Despite this increase in pension cost, the company still maintains a strong liquidity position, with sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity to manage pension obligations and other financial commitments.",

For our U.S. qualified pension plan, an increase in the discount rate resulted in an actuarial g ain of $178 million during  2024, and a decrease in the discount rate resulted in an actuarial loss of $129 million during  2023. Additional drivers of net actuarial loss (g ain) included other assumption updates and plan ex perience. 2\n\nSettlements primarily related to the U.S. qualified pension plan, which was amended in 2023 to provide lump sum payment options to all former employees.

          "chunk_text": "Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the discount rates. If the discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions, if applicable.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of BA Sports Nutrition, LLC ('BodyArmor'), which offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. During 2021, in conjunction with acquiring the remaining ownership interest, we recognized a noncash gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The Company allocated $4.2 billion of the $5.6 billion purchase price to the BodyArmor trademark. During the three months ended March 29, 2024, the operating results related to the trademark were lower than expected. Therefore, the Company revised its projections of the future operating results related to the trademark, which triggered the need to update its impairment analysis. As a result, the Company concluded that the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of $760 million. The decrease in fair value was primarily driven by the revised projections of future operating results as well as higher discount rates resulting from changes in macroeconomic conditions since the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. If the near-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our revised financial projections, or if the macroeconomic conditions change, causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an additional impairment charge. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in future periods.\n\n## Pension Plan Valuations\n\nOur Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States.\n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.\n\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our ex pected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.\n\nIn 2024, the Company's total net periodic pension cost was $45 million. In 2025, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $81 million. The increase in net periodic pension cost is primarily due to a lower ex pected return on assets resulting from a transfer of $523 million of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company in 2024.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64% and 58% of the Company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $7 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an $18 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost.\n\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.",

This decrease was primarily driven by the $6.0 billion IRS Tax  Litigation Deposit, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency ex change rate fluctuations, higher other tax  payments, increased charitable donations, and the reduced operating cash flows resulting from the refranchising of our bottling operations. The decrease was also impacted by additional annual incentive payments in the current year due to improved business performance in the prior year. These items were partially offset by strong cash operating results, the transfer of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company, payments in the prior year resulting from the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, increased dividend payments from our equity method investees, and $167 million of the $275 million milestone payment for fairlife in the prior year. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the refranchising of our bottling operations.

In 2023, purchases of investments were $6,698 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,354 million, resulting in a net cash outflow of $2,344 million. This activity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the Company's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance companies.\n\nAcquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\n\nIn 2024 and 2023, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $315 million and $62 million, respectively.\n\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\n\nIn 2024 and 2023, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $3,485 million and $430 million, respectively. The activity during 2024 primarily related to the refranchising of certain of our bottling operations and sales of our ownership interests in certain equity method investees. The activity during 2023 primarily related to sales of our ownership interests in certain equity method investees. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $2,064 million and $1,852 million, respectively.",

When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the ex pected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\n\n## Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\n\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the Company's long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, which is less than 20 years.\n\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit and cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\n\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. We believe our assumptions are consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units.

          "chunk_text": "depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more difficult to estimate when global financial markets are highly volatile. As these factors are often interdependent and may not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. If we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairment charges, if applicable.\n\n## Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nImpairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs the annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. When performing these impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate.\n\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above.\n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and do\u011fadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\n\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's strategic positioning of Costa within its Global Ventures segment align with its raw material sourcing strategy for coffee and the potential financial risks tied to impairment assessments of the business?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's Global Ventures segment includes Costa, which generates coffee revenues through a diversified supplier base of Rainforest Alliance Certified and other certified green coffee providers, helping mitigate weather-related supply risks (page_10). However, as part of the Global Ventures reporting unit, Costa is subject to annual impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, where fair value estimates are based on discounted cash flows and market approaches\u2014assessments that are particularly sensitive to forecasting accuracy in volatile markets (page_42). Given that Costa is integrated into a broader strategic framework under Global Ventures, which also includes innocent and do\u011fadan, any decline in its financial performance or market conditions could trigger impairment charges that materially affect Coca-Cola\u2019s consolidated financial statements (page_117). Therefore, while Costa's diversified sourcing strategy supports operational resilience, its financial valuation remains exposed to forecasting risks that could lead to impairment charges, directly impacting the company's asset base and profitability.",

Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focusing on strategic initiatives, policy, governance and scaling global initiatives, and (2) a platform services organization supporting operating units, global marketing category leadership teams and the center by providing efficient and scaled global services and capabilities, including, but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and social/digital hubs.\n\n## Segment Products and Services\n\nThe business of our Company is primarily nonalcoholic beverages. Our geographic operating segments (Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; and Asia Pacific) derive a majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of beverage concentrates and syrups and, in some cases, the sale of finished beverages. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and do\u011fadan businesses as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster. Our Bottling Investments operating segment is composed of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of the geographic location of the bottler. Our consolidated bottling operations derive the majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of finished beverages. Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. Refer to Note 3.",

          "chunk_text": "depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more difficult to estimate when global financial markets are highly volatile. As these factors are often interdependent and may not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. If we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairment charges, if applicable.\n\n## Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nImpairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs the annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. When performing these impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate.\n\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above.\n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and do\u011fadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\n\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The assumptions used in our impairment testing models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.",

          "chunk_text": "Our competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers' own store or private-label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nWe and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, such as sucrose, high fructose corn syrup ('HFCS'), aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate, steviol glycosides, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, caffeine, caramel color and flavors; other raw materials such as orange and other fruit juices and juice concentrates, milk, coffee and tea; packaging materials such as polyethylene terephthalate ('PET'), bio-based PET and recycled PET for bottles; and aluminum cans, glass bottles and other containers.\n\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not ex perienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.\n\nIn addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, the principal nutritive sweetener is HFCS, which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. HFCS is available from numerous domestic sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Adverse weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. For example, drought conditions in certain parts of the United States or in other major corn-producing areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for HFCS. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States is sucrose (i.e., table sugar), which is also available from numerous sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our bottlers' requirements with the assistance of CocaCola Bottlers' Sales &amp; Services Company LLC ('CCBSS'). CCBSS is a limited liability company that is owned by authorized Coca-Cola bottlers doing business in the United States and Canada. Among other things, CCBSS provides procurement services to our North American operations and to our U.S. and Canadian bottling partners for the purchase of various goods and services, including HFCS.\n\nThe principal non-nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate and steviol glycosides. Generally, these raw materials are readily available from numerous sources. We purchase sucralose, which we consider a critical raw material, from suppliers mainly in the United States and also China. Our Company generally has not experienced major difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners.\n\nJuice and juice concentrate from various fruits, particularly orange juice and orange juice concentrate, are the principal raw materials for our juice and juice drink products. We source our orange juice and orange juice concentrate from Florida and the Southern Hemisphere (particularly Brazil). We work closely with Cutrale Citrus Juices U.S.A., Inc., our primary supplier of orange juice from Florida and Brazil, to ensure an adequate supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate that meets our Company's standards. However, the citrus industry is impacted by citrus greening disease and the variability of weather conditions that can affect the quality and supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate throughout the industry. In addition, changing weather patterns are adversely affecting citrus production, contributing to challenges such as citrus greening disease and droughts, which have resulted in a reduced number of citrus trees and increased grower costs and prices.\n\nMilk is the principal raw material for our dairy products. We derive the majority of our dairy revenues through fairlife, LLC ('fairlife'), which purchases milk from dairy cooperatives that in turn source milk from farms within the cooperatives. While our sourcing for milk is currently concentrated among a few dairy cooperatives, we believe we have access to alternate suppliers, if necessary, to help deliver an adequate supply of milk.\n\nWe generate most of our coffee revenues through Costa. Costa purchases Rainforest Alliance Certified and other certified green coffee through multiple suppliers, enabling us to source from alternative suppliers as changing weather patterns impact yields in some geographies. Similarly, we procure tea from a diverse supplier base, which helps mitigate the effects of weather-related yield reductions in certain geographies.\n\nOur consolidated bottling operations and our non-bottling finished product operations also purchase various other raw materials, including, but not limited to, PET resin, preforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; plastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and beverage gases, including carbon",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's financial treatment of the fairlife acquisition evolve across its contingent liability disclosures, fair value accounting policies, and operating charges, and what does this reveal about the financial impact of fairlife's performance against financial targets through 2024?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's treatment of the fairlife acquisition reveals a dynamic financial impact tied to fairlife's performance against financial targets through 2024. The contingent consideration liability tied to fairlife\u2019s achievement of financial targets was remeasured quarterly to fair value, with a $3,109 million charge in 2024 and $1,702 million in 2023 recorded in operating charges. The fair value of the remaining milestone payment was determined using a Monte Carlo model, and changes in fair value were recognized in income until the final 2025 payment. Additionally, the fair value accounting policy clarifies that these adjustments were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and were significant enough to be disclosed separately in the balance sheet under other noncurrent liabilities. This shows that fairlife's performance had a material effect on Coca-Cola's financial statements, both in terms of contingent liabilities and recurring operating charges.",

      "question": "How does PMI's impairment of its investment in RBH reflect both the unresolved allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion CCAA settlement and the challenges in estimating fair value through discounted cash flow, particularly in light of the auditor's scrutiny of these assumptions?",
      "answer": "PMI recorded a $2,316 million non-cash impairment charge for its investment in RBH due to the unresolved allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement among RBH, ITL, and JTIM, which created uncertainty in estimating RBH\u2019s fair value. This fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis that relied on significant assumptions such as discount rates, sales volumes, and operating margins of RBH\u2019s combustible tobacco business. The auditor highlighted that these assumptions required substantial judgment and were subject to high levels of scrutiny, particularly regarding the allocation of the settlement amount and its tax deductibility, which directly influenced the impairment assessment and valuation outcome.",

PMI holds an approximate 25% economic interest in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Tabacs Alg\u00e9ro-Emiratie ('STAEM'), an Algerian joint venture that is  51% owned by EITA and 49% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et D\u00e9veloppement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI's brands (SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment).\n\nIn  April  2023,  PMI  acquired  an  approx imate  economic  interest  of 25%  in  United  Tobacco  Company  (\"UTC\").  UTC  is  an  entity  incorporated  in  Egypt  which manufactures products under license for PMI's Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of 14.7% in Eastern Company ('Eastern\"), Egypt's largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes. In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The max imum amount of these guarantee obligations is $385 million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.\n\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV , EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded  at  cost  and  are  included  in  equity  investments  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Transactions  between  these  equity  method  investees  and  PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below.\n\n## Equity securities:\n\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH') obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.\n\nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $3,280 million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global",

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's equity investment impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company's investment in RBH. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value  estimate  of  the  investment  in  RBH;  (ii)  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  the  discounted  cash  flow  analysis;  (iii)  testing  completeness  and  accuracy  of underlying  data  used  in  the  discounted  cash  flow  analysis;  (iv)  evaluating  the  reasonableness  of  significant  assumptions  used  by  management  related  to  the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the valuation of the combustible cigarette business and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate  global  settlement  amount;  and  (v)  evaluating  the  deductibility  of  the  settlement  amount  payment  for  income  tax   purposes  in  Canada.

      "answer": "Philip Morris International faces increasing global regulatory pressure around health warnings, which is evident from its detailed discussion of 65% health warning mandates in the EU under the TPD, its business strategy emphasizing support for 'clear standards' and innovation in smoke-free products, and its acknowledgment of the material adverse impact such regulations could have on consumer access and profitability. While the company opposes 'blanket bans,' it strategically aligns with regulatory frameworks that allow for the commercialization of reduced-risk products like IQOS and ZYN, even as it warns investors of the potential for health warning expansion and plain packaging laws to reduce brand differentiation and increase illicit trade. This multi-faceted approach reveals both the compliance burden and the strategic pivot toward science-based alternatives to mitigate long-term risks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Regulatory Restrictions\n\nSFP Sales Prohibitions : Some governments have banned, are seeking to ban, or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our SFPs, and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products. Significant markets that have prohibited or severely restricted the sale of one or more category of SFP include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Thailand, and V ietnam. In the U.S., some states and municipalities have introduced stringent restrictions on the sale of certain SFPs, including those authorized by the FDA.\n\nThese regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access to products that might be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke cigarettes. We oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued cigarette smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all SFP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes.\n\nEU Tobacco Products Directive (\"TPD\") : In April 2014, the EU adopted a significantly revised TPD, which came into force in May 2016. All EU Member States have adopted laws transposing the TPD.  The TPD sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products, including:\n\n- health warnings covering 65% of the front and back panels of cigarette packs, with an option for Member States to further standardize tobacco packaging, including the introduction of plain packaging;\n- a ban on characterizing flavors in some tobacco products;\n- security features and tracking and tracing measures; and\n- a framework for the regulation of novel tobacco products and e-cigarettes, including requirements for health warnings and information leaflets, a prohibition on  product  packaging  text  related  to  reduced  risk,  and  the  introduction  of  notification  requirements  or  authorization  procedures  in  advance  of commercialization.\n\nIn February 2024, the European Commission published an updated implementation roadmap to Europe's Beating Cancer Plan (the \"Plan\"). Further developments concerning a revision of TPD are expected during the mandate of the European Commission that took office in December 2024.\n\nIn May 2024, the EU-wide systems of traceability and security features for tobacco products were extended to include tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products. As such, all tobacco products are covered by the traceability system.\n\nEU Tobacco Excise Directive (\"TED\") : The EU Commission is preparing a legislative proposal for the revision of the 2011 EU Tobacco Excise Directive that may include definitions and tax treatment for novel tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including heated tobacco products, e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. The timeline for the revision has not been announced. Any final amendments to TED require unanimous agreement by all EU Member States, followed by transposition of TED into national legislation.\n\nPlain Packaging and Other Packaging Restrictions : Plain packaging legislation bans the use of branding, logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font. To date, plain packaging laws have been adopted in certain markets in all of our operating segments, including the key markets of Australia, France, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Some countries, such as Canada, Denmark and Israel, adopted plain packaging regulations that apply to all tobacco products, including SFPs. Other countries are also considering plain packaging legislation.\n\nSome countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging. Examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages, prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\n\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients : The WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in both combustible and SFPs, including menthol. Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products, which could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term. In many countries, menthol or flavor bans would eliminate entire product categories.",

In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as postmarket studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies' IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match's General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI's IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. V ersions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI's transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product. By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\n\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled  prescription  products  for  therapy  areas  that  include  pain  management  and  cardiovascular  emergencies.  This  includes  medical  and  pharmaceutical cannabinoids,  and  non-recreational  cannabinoid  products  (including  CBD),  in  line  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  though  any  revenue  related  to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.

Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"). Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco and nicotine-containing products to adult nicotine users. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include:\n\n- restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell tobacco or nicotine-containing products;\n- the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;\n- restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;\n- the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;\n- restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and mandating plain packaging;\n- restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions;\n- restrictions or bans on the display of product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on vending machines;\n- generation sales bans, under which the sale of certain tobacco or nicotine-containing products to people born after a certain year would be prohibited;\n- requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and/or other smoke or product constituents;\n- disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients, including bans on the flavors of certain tobacco and nicotine-containing products;\n- increased restrictions on smoking and use of tobacco and nicotine-containing products in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;\n- restrictions or prohibitions of novel tobacco or nicotine-containing products or related devices;\n- elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers;\n- restrictions in terms of importing or ex porting our products impacting our logistics activities and ability to ship our products;\n- encouraging litigation against tobacco companies; and\n- excluding tobacco companies from transparent public dialogue regarding public health and other policy matters.\n\nOur financial results could be materially affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands. More specifically, requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our SFPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\n## Changes in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. Our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and div idends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls and other regulations.\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the  base  erosion  and  profit  shifting  project  undertaken  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (the  \"OECD\"),  which  recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, and could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, PMI recorded an impairment charge related to definite-lived intangible assets of $112 million. This charge was included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment.

The Supreme Court ruling reversed previous decisions that were in PM Korea's favor at the trial and appellate levels. As a result of the ruling, we concluded that an adverse outcome was probable. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $204 million in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earning, reflecting the full amount previously paid by PM Korea, which was included in the EA, AU &amp; PMI DF segment for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n- Termination  of  agreement  with  Foundation  for  a  Smoke-Free  World -On  September  29,  2023,  PMI  and  the  Foundation  for  a  Smoke-Free  World  (the \"Foundation\") entered into the Final G rant Agreement and Termination of the Second Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (\"Agreement\"). Under the terms of the agreement, PMI paid $140 million in the third quarter of 2023 in return for the termination of the pledge agreement between the parties. As a result, in the third quarter of 2023, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $140 million commensurate with the early termination of the pledge agreement. The pre-tax charge was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 and was included in the operating results of the following segments: Europe ($60 million); SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA ($41  million); EA, AU &amp; PMI DF ($24 million); and Americas ($15 million).\n- Charges related to the war in U kraine -See Note 4.

PMI and KT&amp;G  will seek any necessary regulatory approvals that may be required on a market-bymarket basis.\n\nOn July 30, 2024, PMI announced a memorandum of understanding with KT&amp;G. This non-binding memorandum establishes the parties' intent to collaborate on regulatory submissions for those new KT&amp;G heat-not-burn products that PMI selects to commercialize in the U.S. KT&amp;G 's new platform products are expected to be launched first outside the U.S. Thereafter, the partners plan to work on a PMTA submission for review by the U.S. FDA, in accordance with the memorandum.\n\n## Equity Investments\n\nWe discuss our equity investments in Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Trade Policy\n\nPMI complies with all applicable trade restrictions and requirements, including sanctions, in the markets in which it operates. We have taken appropriate actions in response to the latest sanctions to ensure full compliance with the relevant restrictions.\n\nWe are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU, Switzerland, the U.K., and other jurisdictions in which we do business ('Trade Sanctions'), including  the  trade  and  economic  sanctions  administered  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury's  Office  of  Foreign Assets  Control  ('OFAC')  and  the  U.S. Department of State. It is our policy to comply fully with these Trade Sanctions.\n\nPursuant to specific exemptions or licenses, or where sanctions do not apply to our business, PMI may make sales in countries subject to Trade Sanctions.\n\nWe do not do business or sell products in Belarus, Iran, North Korea or Syria.\n\nWe sell cigarettes in Cuba under a distribution agreement. These sales are permitted by U.S. law under a License Exception for Agricultural Commodities, issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Bureau of Industry and Security), and specifically granted to our distributor.\n\nCertain states within the U.S. have enacted legislation permitting or requiring state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. Because we do business in certain of these countries, consistent with our policy to fully comply with Trade Sanctions and as described above, these state pension funds may have divested of our stock or may not invest in our stock. We do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares.\n\nFollowing the start of the conflict in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the U.S., the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and other countries introduced extensive economic sanctions and export controls in relation",

          "chunk_text": "## Commercialization of SFPs\n\nWe are continuing to develop a multiplatform approach and tailoring our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market. We focus our commercialization  efforts  on  consumer  retail  ex perience,  guided  consumer  trials  and  customer  care,  and  increasingly,  digital  communication  programs  and  ecommerce. In order to accelerate switching to our SFPs, our initial market introductions typically entail one-on-one consumer engagement (in person or by digital means) and device discounts. These initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment, which we believe will moderate over time and further benefit from the increased use of digital engagement capabilities. PMI has, and continues to, invest in digital consumer engagement.\n\nIn 2014, we introduced IQOS in pilot city launches in Nagoya, Japan, and in Milan, Italy. Since then, we have continuously expanded our commercialization activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets.\n\nWe have  integrated  the  production  of  our  heated  tobacco  units  into  several  of  our  ex isting  manufacturing  facilities,  are  progressing  with  our  plans  to  build manufacturing capacity for our other SFPs, and continue to optimize our manufacturing infrastructure and expand our commercialization activities for new products and markets. We discuss certain risks related to the commercialization and supply of our SFP portfolio in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results in this report .\n\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements-Note 7. Product W arranty in this report. The significance of warranty claims depends on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, PMI announced that it had reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc., (\"Altria\") to end the companies' commercial relationship as of April 30, 2024, with respect to IQOS in the U.S. (the 'Altria Agreement'). Under the Altria Agreement, PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the United States - the world's largest smoke-free market. The Altria Agreement provides a clear path to expanding IQOS 's international success in a market where over 28 million adults continue to smoke cigarettes.\n\nIn January 2020, we announced an agreement with KT&amp;G, a leading tobacco and nicotine company in South Korea, for the commercialization of KT&amp;G 's smoke-free products outside of South Korea on an exclusive basis. On January 30, 2023, we announced a renewal and extension of this arrangement. For more information, see Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Business Arrangements below.\n\nOur commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed SFPs are as follows:\n\n- In late 2022, we began commercializing our BONDS product in the Philippines and Colombia.\n- Since August 2020, we have launched and expanded our portfolio of vaping products (branded VEEV ) in 40 markets.\n- Following our acquisition of Swedish Match, we have access to a strong portfolio of Swedish Match brands in both the snus and nicotine pouch categories. Nicotine pouches are currently available in 38 markets.\n\n## Legislation,  Regulation,  T axation  and  Other  Matters  Regarding  the  Manufacture,  Marketing,  Sale  and  Use  of  T obacco  and  Other  Nicotine-Containing Products\n\n## Fiscal Challenges\n\nExcessive  and  disruptive  ex cise,  sales  and  other  tax   increases  and  discriminatory  tax   structures  are  ex pected  to  continue  to  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our profitability, due to lower consumption and consumer down-trading to non-premium, discount, other low-price or low-taxed products such as fine cut tobacco, illicit cigarettes or illicit SFPs. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, some of our products are subject to tax  structures that discriminate against premium-price products and manufactured  cigarettes.  We  believe  that  such  tax   policies  undermine  public  health  by  encouraging  consumers  to  turn  to  illicit  trade,  and  ultimately  undercut government revenue objectives, disrupt the competitive environment, and encourage criminal activity. Other jurisdictions have imposed, or are seeking to impose, levies or other tax es specifically on tobacco companies, such as tax es on revenues and/or profits.",

      "question": "How does PM's capital expenditure allocation in EA,AU&PMIDF compare with its revenue generation and restructuring charges in the same region, and what might this suggest about the company's strategic focus there?",
      "answer": "PM allocated only $22 million to capital expenditures in EA,AU&PMIDF in 2024, a decrease from $38 million in 2023. Meanwhile, the region generated $2,516 million in combustible tobacco revenue and $3,877 million in smoke-free revenue in 2024, indicating that it remains a significant contributor to sales. However, the company recorded no restructuring charges and no asset impairment or contract termination charges in EA,AU&PMIDF in 2024, suggesting limited strategic changes or operational adjustments in the region despite its notable revenue contribution. This could imply a stable but potentially underinvested position in this market.",

      "answer": "Altria's 10-K filing reveals a multi-layered risk profile stemming from FSPTCA-related regulatory pressures. In the business environment section, the FSPTCA is cited as a key challenge impacting the company's ability to achieve its Vision, with evolving adult consumer preferences and regulatory actions like advertising restrictions and pre-market review pathways influencing competitive dynamics. The regulatory framework section elaborates on the FSPTCA's enforcement mechanisms, including advertising limitations and the potential for new product standards, while also noting the uncertainty around FDA enforcement of descriptors like 'mild' in the Black & Mild brand. Finally, the product standards section highlights specific threats, such as the FDA's proposed menthol ban in cigarettes and cigars\u2014which could materially affect Altria's core smokeable products\u2014and the potential NNN standard for smokeless tobacco, which could directly impact USSTC's operations. Together, these perspectives indicate that FSPTCA-driven regulations could constrain Altria's ability to innovate, market, and profitably sustain both traditional and emerging tobacco products.",

These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail in Note 18, Item 1A and Item 3, include:\n\n- pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements;\n- restrictions and requirements imposed by the FSPTCA, and restrictions and requirements (and related enforcement actions) that have been, and in the future will be, imposed by the FDA;\n- actual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements;\n- bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers;\n- other federal, state and local government actions, including:\n- restrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes;\n- additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products;\n- other actual and proposed tobacco-related legislation and regulation; and\n- governmental investigations;\n- reductions in cigarette and MST consumption levels due to growth of innovative tobacco products;\n- increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities (including retail establishments) to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products;\n- changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior, which is influenced by various factors such as economic conditions (including inflation), excise taxes and price gap relationships, may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to discount products or other lower-priced tobacco products;\n- the highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories, including competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products;\n- illicit trade in tobacco products;\n- potential adverse changes in prices, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials and component parts; and\n- the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to and in connection with the foregoing, evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences are continuing to impact the tobacco industry.

Adult smokers continue to transition from cigarettes to exclusive use of smoke-free tobacco product alternatives, which aligns with Altria's Vision.\n\nAltria and its tobacco operating companies work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing products both within and outside the United States through innovation and other growth strategies (including, where appropriate, arrangements with, or investments in, third parties).\n\nOver the past two years, the legislative and regulatory activities discussed below negatively impacted growth in the e-vapor category. While these activities continue to impact the e-vapor category, the category experienced moderate growth in 2021 and remains competitive.\n\nOral nicotine pouch retail share of the total oral tobacco category grew significantly over the prior year from 8.4% during 2020 to 15.4% during 2021. The oral nicotine pouch category has become increasingly competitive.\n\nWe are monitoring the sale and continued introduction of unregulated synthetic nicotine products, which may lead to further competition for regulated tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, and may result in underage use of these unregulated products if not marketed responsibly by manufacturers.\n\nAltria and its tobacco operating companies believe the innovative tobacco products categories will continue to be dynamic due to competition, adult tobacco consumer exploration of a variety of tobacco product options, adult consumer perceptions of the relative risks of smoke-free products compared to cigarettes, FDA determinations on product applications and legislative actions.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that, when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences and other factors, domestic cigarette industry volume declined by 5.5%. Altria expects 2022 cigarette industry volume trends to continue to be most influenced by (i) changes to adult smoker stay-at-home practices, disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of smokefree products, (ii) economic conditions (including unemployment rates, the impact of increased inflation and gasoline prices), (iii) fiscal stimulus, (iv) cross-category movement, (v) the timing and extent of COVID-19 vaccine administration and the impact of COVID-19 variants, and (vi) regulatory and legislative (including excise tax) developments.\n\nEconomic conditions (including a high inflationary environment) can also impact adult tobacco consumer purchasing behavior. For example, economic downturns have resulted in adult tobacco consumers choosing discount products and other lower priced tobacco products. Although the economic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic did not meaningfully increase the growth of discount and lower priced tobacco products throughout much of the pandemic, in part due to stimulus payments, discount cigarette products resumed share growth in the second half of 2021 driven primarily by deep discount products. Share gains for discount cigarette products typically coincide with rising gas prices, higher inflation and increased consumer mobility. We expect fluctuations in discount cigarette product segment share to continue as price sensitive adult tobacco consumers react to economic conditions in the current high inflationary environment.\n\n## FSPTCA and FDA Regulation\n\n- The Regulatory Framework: The FSPTCA, its implementing regulations and its 2016 deeming regulations establish broad FDA regulatory authority over all tobacco products and, among other provisions:\n- impose restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products (see Final Tobacco Marketing Rule below);\n- establish pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products (see Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below);\n- prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;\n- authorize the FDA to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health; and\n- equip the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities.\n\nThe FSPTCA also bans descriptors such as 'light,' 'low' or 'mild' when used as descriptors of modified risk, unless expressly authorized by the FDA. In connection with a 2016 lawsuit initiated by Middleton, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the FDA, informed Middleton that the FDA does not intend to bring an enforcement action against Middleton for the use of the term 'mild' in the trademark 'Black &amp; Mild.' Consequently, Middleton dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice. If the FDA were to change its position at some later date, Middleton would have the opportunity to bring another lawsuit.\n\n- Final Tobacco Marketing Rule: As required by the FSPTCA, in March 2010, the FDA promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products (the 'Final Tobacco Marketing Rule'). The May (1)\n\n'Smokeless tobacco,' as used in this section of this Form 10-K, refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the FDA in 2009, including MST. It excludes oral nicotine pouches, which were first regulated by the FDA in 2016. (1)",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## \u25aa Potential Product Standards\n\n- Nicotine in Cigarettes and Other Combustible Tobacco Products : In March 2018, the FDA issued an ANPRM seeking comments on the potential public health benefits and any possible adverse effects of lowering nicotine in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels. Among other issues, the FDA sought comments on (i) whether smokers would compensate by smoking more cigarettes to obtain the same level of nicotine as with their current product and (ii) whether the proposed rule would create an illicit trade of cigarettes containing nicotine at levels higher than a nonaddictive threshold that may be established by the FDA. The FDA also sought comments on whether a nicotine product standard should apply to other combustible tobacco products, including cigars. Were the FDA to develop and finalize a product standard for nicotine in combustible products, and if the standard was appealed and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies.\n- Flavors in Tobacco Products : As discussed above under FDA's Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation , the FDA indicated that it is considering proposing rulemaking for a product standard that would seek to ban menthol in combustible tobacco products, including cigarettes and cigars, and that it intends to propose a product standard that would ban characterizing flavors in all cigars, including Grandfathered Products and those that have received SE determinations from the FDA - an intention reiterated in the FDA's January 2020 guidance. In March 2018, the FDA issued an ANPRM seeking comments on the role, if any, that flavors (including menthol) in tobacco products may play in attracting youth and in helping some smokers switch to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery. In the context of litigation, in April 2021, the FDA issued a response to a 2013 citizen petition requesting that the FDA prohibit menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes. In the response, the FDA announced it intends to develop and propose two product standards, which are expected by the second quarter of 2022, that would (i) ban menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and (ii) ban all characterizing flavors (including menthol) in cigars. While the FDA has yet to define 'characterizing flavors' with respect to cigars, most of Middleton's cigar products contain added flavors and may be subject to any action by the FDA to ban flavors in cigars.\n- If any such product standards become final and are appealed and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL (due to the impact on JUUL's business) if the FDA pursues broader flavor restrictions beyond cigarettes and cigars.\n- NNN in Smokeless Tobacco : In January 2017, the FDA proposed a product standard for N-nitrosonornicotine ('NNN') levels in finished smokeless tobacco products.  If the proposed rule, in present form, were to become final and was appealed and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and USSTC.\n- Good Manufacturing Practices: The FSPTCA requires that the FDA promulgate good manufacturing practice regulations (referred to by the FDA as 'Requirements for Tobacco Product Manufacturing Practice') for tobacco product manufacturers, but does not specify a timeframe for such regulations. Compliance with any such regulations could result in increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of Altria, its tobacco operating companies and its investees, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n- Impact on Our Business; Compliance Costs and User Fees: FDA regulatory actions under the FSPTCA could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies in various ways. For example, actions by the FDA could:\n- impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products;\n- delay, discontinue or prevent the sale or distribution of existing, new or modified tobacco products;\n- limit adult tobacco consumer choices;\n- impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers;\n- create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies;\n- impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements;\n- impose additional restrictions at retail;\n- result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products; and/or\n- otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.\n\nThe failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements, even inadvertently, and FDA enforcement actions also could have a material adverse effect on the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nThe FSPTCA imposes user fees on cigarette, cigarette tobacco, smokeless tobacco, cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters. The FSPTCA does not impose user fees on e-vapor or oral nicotine pouch",

Historical NPM Adjustment disputes have resulted in both liabilities and recoveries, such as the $1.03 billion received through a multi-state settlement and expected credits through 2029 (page_103). Looking forward, Altria estimates an average of $4.4 billion annually over the next three years for these agreements, excluding potential NPM adjustments, and paid $4.7 billion in 2021 alone (page_49).

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

See Smoking and Health Litigation - Other Smoking and Health Class Actions above for a discussion of these proceedings. See Guarantees and Other Similar Matters below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.\n\nSettlements of Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation: In November 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (the 'MSA') with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the 'State Settlement Agreements'). The State Settlement Agreements require that the original participating manufacturers or 'OPMs' (now PM USA, R.J. Reynolds and, with respect to certain brands, ITG Brands, LLC ('ITG')) make annual payments of approximately $9.4 billion, subject to adjustments for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume. In addition, the OPMs are required to pay settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees, subject to an annual cap of $500 million; these quarterly payments are expected to end in 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the State Settlement Agreements was approximately $4.3 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. These amounts include PM USA's estimate of amounts related to NPM Adjustments discussed below.\n\nNPM Adjustment Disputes: The 'NPM Adjustment' is a reduction in MSA payments made by the OPMs and those manufacturers that are subsequent signatories to the MSA (collectively, the 'participating manufacturers' or 'PMs') that applies if the PMs collectively lose at least a specified level of market share to non-participating manufacturers since 1997, subject to certain conditions and defenses.\n\nThe independent auditor ('IA') appointed under the MSA has calculated that PM USA's share of the maximum potential NPM Adjustments for 2004-2020 is (exclusive of interest or earnings): $388 million for 2004; $181 million for 2005; $154 million for 2006; $185 million for 2007; $250 million for 2008; $211 million for 2009; $218 million for 2010; $166 million for 2011; $214 million for 2012; $224 million for 2013; $258 million for 2014; $313 million for 2015; $292 million for 2016; $302 million for 2017; $325 million for 2018; $444 million for 2019; and $572 million for 2020. These maximum amounts will be reduced, likely substantially, to reflect the NPM Adjustment settlements discussed below, and potentially for current and future calculation disputes and other developments. In addition, PM USA's recovery of these amounts, even as reduced, is dependent upon subsequent determinations regarding state-specific defenses and disputes with other PMs.\n\n## Settlements of NPM Adjustment Disputes.\n\n- Multi-State Settlement . By the end of 2018, PM USA entered into a multi-state settlement of NPM Adjustment disputes with a total of 36 MSA states and territories in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes through 2022 with 35 of the 36 states, and through 2024 with one state. Pursuant to the multi-state settlement, PM USA received $1.03 billion and expects to receive approximately $320 million in credits to offset PM USA's MSA payments through 2029.\n- New York Settlement. In 2015, PM USA entered into a separate NPM Adjustment settlement with New York in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes with New York in perpetuity. PM USA received $373 million pursuant to the New York settlement and expects to receive annual credits applied against the MSA payments due to New York going forward.\n- Montana Settlement . In 2020, PM USA entered into a separate NPM Adjustment settlement with Montana in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes with Montana through 2030. This settlement resulted in a payment by PM USA of $4 million.\n\n## Continuing NPM Adjustment Disputes with States That Have Not Settled.\n\n- 2004 NPM Adjustment. The PMs and the 10 states that have not settled the NPM Adjustment disputes are currently arbitrating NPM Adjustment disputes for 2004 in a multi-state arbitration. Hearings for nine of the 10 states have concluded. In September 2021, the arbitration panels issued decisions finding that two states, Missouri and Washington, were not diligent in their enforcement of their escrow statutes in 2004 and, therefore, are subject to the NPM adjustment for 2004. The arbitration panels further found that the remaining seven states were diligent in their enforcement and, therefore, are not subject to the NPM adjustment for 2004. The hearing for one remaining state is currently scheduled for February 2022. The two states determined by the arbitration panel to be non-diligent have filed motions in applicable state courts and with the arbitration panels challenging these determinations and several issues remain to be resolved by the arbitration panels that will affect the final amount of the 2004 NPM adjustment PM USA and other PMs will receive. PM USA recorded $21 million as a reduction to cost of sales in the third quarter of 2021 for its estimate of the minimum amount of the 2004 NPM adjustment it will receive. PM USA estimates it is entitled to interest of approximately $23 million in connection with the 2004 NPM adjustment, which it recorded as interest income in the third quarter of 2021.\n- 2005-2007 NPM Adjustments. The PMs and the 10 states that have not settled the NPM Adjustment disputes are currently arbitrating NPM Adjustment disputes before a single arbitration panel. The arbitration encompasses three years, 2005-2007, for nine of the 10 states, and one year, 2005, for one state. As of January 24, 2022, no decisions have resulted from the arbitration.\n- Subsequent Years. No assurance can be given as to when proceedings for 2008 and subsequent years will be scheduled or the precise form those proceedings will take.",

Michelle Transaction, which was used to partially fund the expansion of the January 2021 share repurchase program as discussed in Note 10. Capital Stock to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 10').\n\nIn October 2020, Altria filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which Altria may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nAltria has no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 18, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2021. From time to time, subsidiaries of Altria also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 9, PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, Altria makes interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 9.\n\nPurchase Obligations - Altria has entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2021, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $827 million and $1,274 million thereafter (a decrease from $1,095 million and $2,902 million at December 31, 2020, respectively, driven primarily by the Ste. Michelle Transaction).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria had $609 million of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. Substantially all of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on Altria's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 18, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states and territories of the United States that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 18.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that Altria's subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $4.4 billion on average for the next three years. These amounts exclude the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. Altria's subsidiaries paid approximately $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2021, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $50 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAlthough litigation is subject to uncertainty and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of PM USA, UST or Altria in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 18, Item 3 and Item 1A, management expects cash flow from operations, together with Altria's access to capital markets, to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs.\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities - Altria had $1.5 billion of accrued postretirement health care costs on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and estimates approximately $100 million of annual payments. In addition, Altria has accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets. For further information on Altria's postretirement health care and pension",

      "answer": "Altria's JUUL investment, valued at $1.705 billion in 2021, reflects a significant financial commitment that is subject to both market valuation volatility and regulatory risk. The decision to account for the investment under the fair value option (as noted in page 64) exposes Altria to potential earnings volatility based on JUUL's changing market valuation. Additionally, the FTC's antitrust challenge (discussed on page 15) threatens the very existence of the investment, with potential remedies including divestiture or transaction rescission. Despite these risks, Altria continues to hold the investment at fair value on its balance sheet, indicating strategic intent to maintain its stake despite uncertain regulatory and financial outcomes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Altria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage, tobacco control actions and other factors, which could adversely affect Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\nOur ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions. The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that may enjoy greater societal acceptance and fewer longer-term challenges. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent. In addition, our ability to retain the best talent may be adversely affected by current labor market dynamics in which the number of U.S. workers leaving their jobs increased significantly. Failure to attract and retain the best talent could adversely affect Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\n## Altria may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\nWe periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions (such as continued uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic), regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences, success of planned new product expansions, competitive activity and income and excise taxes. Certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets. If an impairment is determined to exist in either situation, we will incur impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. For further discussion, see Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7.\n\n## Risks Related to the Capital Markets and Financing\n\n## Acquisitions or other events may adversely affect Altria's credit rating, and Altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction.\n\nFrom time to time, Altria considers acquisitions, investments or dispositions and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. Although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition, investment, disposition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our investment grade credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in JUUL. Any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and also may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our businesses or investments on favorable terms, which may result in a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n## Disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect Altria's access to these markets, earnings and dividend rate.\n\nAccess to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. For example, we typically access the commercial paper market early in the second quarter to help fund payments under the Master Settlement Agreement (the 'MSA') tax obligations and shareholder dividends. Disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.\n\n## Altria may be unable to attract investors due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage.\n\nThere is increasing investor focus on environmental, social and governance ('ESG') matters. Organizations that provide ESG information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Decreasing social acceptance of tobacco products or unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward Altria, which could result in shareholders choosing to divest their ownership in Altria stock or potential investors choosing not to invest in Altria stock and could have a negative impact on the market performance of Altria stock.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Investments\n\n## A challenge to our investment in JUUL, if successful, could result in a broad range of resolutions, including divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction.\n\nA challenge to our investment in JUUL, if successful, could result in a broad range of resolutions such as divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction. In April 2020, the FTC issued an administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL alleging that Altria's 35% investment in JUUL and the associated agreements constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act, and substantially lessened competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The FTC seeks a broad range of remedies, including divestiture of Altria's investment in JUUL, rescission of the transaction and prohibition against any officer or director of either Altria or JUUL serving on the other's board of directors or attending meetings.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ninvestments in equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets. Equity method investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting are reported at cost and adjusted each period for Altria's share of (income) losses and dividends paid, if any. Altria reports its share of ABI's and Cronos's results using a one-quarter lag because results are not available in time for Altria to record them in the concurrent period. Altria reviews its equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of its investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired and reduced to fair value, and the impairment is recognized in the period identified. The factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and Altria's intent and ability to hold its investment until recovery.\n\nFollowing Share Conversion (as defined in Note 6. Investments in Equity Securities ) in the fourth quarter of 2020, Altria elected to account for its equity investment in JUUL under the fair value option. Under this option, any cash dividends received and any changes in the fair value of the equity investment in JUUL, which is calculated quarterly using level 3 fair value measurements, are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). The fair value of the equity investment in JUUL is included in investments in equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Prior to Altria exercising its right to convert its non-voting shares to voting shares, Altria accounted for its investment in JUUL as an investment in an equity security. Since the JUUL shares did not have a readily determinable fair value, Altria elected to measure its investment in JUUL at its cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n- Litigation Contingencies and Costs: Altria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when it is determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). See Note 18. Contingencies .\n- Marketing Costs: Altria's businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. Consumer engagement program payments are made to third parties. Altria's businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses). For interim reporting purposes, Altria's businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Revenue Recognition: Altria's businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. While Altria's businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type, all sales contracts are similarly structured. These contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer. All performance obligations are satisfied within one year; therefore, costs to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred and unsatisfied performance obligations are not disclosed. There is no financing component because Altria's businesses expect, at contract inception, that the period between when Altria's businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less.\n\nAltria's businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Altria's businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nAltria's businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer. Altria's businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer. Altria's businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses). Altria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. Altria's businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. Expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nPayment terms vary depending on product type. Altria's businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. PM USA receives payment in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product. USSTC and Helix receive substantially all payments within one business day of the customer obtaining control of the product. Amounts due from customers are included in receivables on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.",

      "answer": "In 2021, smokeable products contributed $10,394 million to operating income, a slight increase from $9,985 million in 2020. However, restructuring costs associated with smokeable products dropped significantly from $59 million in 2020 to $2 million in 2021. Additionally, the value of other intangible assets related to smokeable products was $3,017 million in 2021, down from $3,044 million in 2020. This indicates that while operating performance remained strong in 2021, the company incurred fewer restructuring costs and experienced a slight decline in the net value of intangible assets for smokeable products.",

      "question": "How does Colgate's increasing exposure to alternative retail channels like subscription services and DTC businesses affect its competitive positioning, profitability, and customer relationship dynamics, especially in light of its 11% reliance on Walmart and the pricing pressures mentioned across different sections of the 10-K?",
      "answer": "Colgate faces a complex landscape shaped by the rapid rise of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer (DTC) businesses. These channels have introduced pricing pressures and shifted power dynamics, especially with large retailers like Walmart, which accounts for 11% of Colgate\u2019s net sales. As traditional retailers integrate digital operations and consumers increasingly shop online, Colgate must adapt its strategies to maintain profitability and brand positioning. The company has been negatively impacted by changes in retailer practices, including pricing pressures and limitations on shelf space, which are exacerbated by the growth of alternative retail models. While Colgate is investing in digital capabilities and innovation to scale with these trends, the evolving retail environment poses ongoing risks to its competitive positioning and financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents\n\nOur Oral, Personal and Home Care products are sold to a variety of retailers, wholesalers and distributors worldwide. Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. Certain of our products are also sold direct-to-consumer. Our sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represented approximately 11% of our Net sales in 2024. No other customer represented more than 10% of our Net sales in 2024. We support our products with advertising, promotion and other marketing (with increasing emphasis on digital) to build awareness and trial of our products. Our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers.\n\nThe majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products is purchased from other companies and is available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of our total material requirements. We do, however, purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards (including those relating to responsible sourcing), which can require additional investment and/or take a significant period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Item 1A, 'Risk Factors - Volatility in material and other costs has in the past and may continue to adversely impact our profitability' and Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the substantial growth of eCommerce, the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. Products similar to ours are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and around the world. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. In certain geographies, we also face strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do. Private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nThe retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer behavior and preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online, including to compare prices and product availability) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new products and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels.\n\nWe consider trademarks to be material to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where our products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Darlie, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso, Tom's of Maine, EltaMD, Filorga, Irish Spring, Lady Speed Stick, PCA SKIN, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Murphy, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill's Science Diet and Hill's Prescription Diet. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although we actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nGiven that approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye, which are considered hyper-inflationary economies. Effective January 1, 2025, we designated Nigeria as a hyper-inflationary economy. Consequently, the functional currency for our Nigerian subsidiary will be the U.S. dollar and the impact of all future Nigerian currency fluctuations will be recorded in income. However, this designation is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed above, we continue to experience higher raw and packaging material costs, including the impact of transactional foreign exchange. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as our funding-the-growth and revenue growth management initiatives, in the current environment it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.\n\nWhile the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors (including private label competitors), from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion.\n\nWe have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, technology-aided category pricing pressures, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online, including to compare prices and product availability) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We are building and scaling our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, data, analytics and artificial intelligence and investing behind higher growth businesses. The substantial growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of geopolitical events and tensions, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, tensions between China and Taiwan and the developments in trade relations, and the challenging market conditions discussed above, on our business and the related uncertainties and risks. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of these events and conditions, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of their impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. For more information about factors that could impact our business, see 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain, dedicated and diverse global team and focused business strategy. Our strategy is based on delivering consistent compounded earnings per share growth through driving organic sales growth, operational efficiencies and leveraging the strength of our balance sheet. We believe increased household penetration and improved brand health are the keys to consistent organic sales growth and aim to achieve these through science-led, core and premium innovation, pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments and expanding in faster-growing channels and markets. We aim to deliver margin expansion and cash flow growth through operating leverage and efficiency. We also seek to lead in the development of human capital and to maximize our Sustainability &amp; Social Impact Strategy. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to profitability and driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges we face and increase shareholder value over time.",

A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape and changing consumer preferences may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, the substantial growth of eCommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers, and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do. They have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances, slotting fees, increased investment, including through display media, paid search and co-op programs, or changes to product assortments, which have led to and could continue to lead to reduced sales or profitability in certain markets. The loss of a key customer or distributor or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer or distributor could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our customers, see 'Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents' in Item 1 'Business.'\n\nWe also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, technologyaided category pricing pressures, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, or sustainability, supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives. For ex ample, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain requirements and standards could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, 'private label' products sold by our retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nFurther, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the substantial growth of eCommerce, changing consumer behaviors and preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online, including to compare prices and product availability) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-customer businesses. The substantial growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.\n\nIn addition, consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors, including evolving consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding sustainability and social impact practices, including the sourcing and sustainability of raw and packaging materials, a demand for natural or organic products and ingredients and ingredient transparency, consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the effects of ingredients, consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources and perceptions of and increased focus on labor and human rights and environmental impacts (including responsible sourcing, deforestation, packaging, plastic, energy and water use and waste management).\n\nIf we are not successful in continuing to adapt or to effectively react to changes in consumer behaviors, preferences or purchasing patterns and/or changing market dynamics, including customer policies or the proliferation of eCommerce and alternative retail channels, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## The growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.\n\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies. Our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully:\n\n- identify, develop and fund technological innovations;",

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nIn connection with management changes, the Company realigned the reporting structure of its skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with the other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. The Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker who uses Operating Profit to assess performance and to allocate resources for each of the reportable operating segments in the budgeting and forecasting process. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 11% of the Company's Net sales in each of the years 2024, 2023 and 2022. No other customer represented more than 10% of Net sales in any period presented.\n\nIn 2024, Corporate Operating profit included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $85. In 2023, Corporate Operating profit included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $27 and product recall costs of $25. In 2022, Corporate Operating profit included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges of $721, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $95, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific of $47 and acquisition-related costs of $19.",

Additionally, the company's overall risk management framework includes foreign exchange contracts and other financial instruments to hedge against currency and commodity risks, aligning with its treasury policies that prohibit speculative use of derivatives (page_55).

A significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Volatility in material and other costs has in the past and may continue to adversely impact our profitability.\n\nRaw and packaging material commodities, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy (including fuel prices), logistics (including trucks and containers) or other necessary services, including as a result of geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, and/or the impact of climatic events have affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our profit margins. While the prices of many commodities and services have retreated from their historical peaks, prices may increase again, which could create year-over-year inflationary pressure. We have taken and may continue to take actions to mitigate these cost increases in the form of price increases and efforts to achieve cost efficiencies in areas such as manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. These actions may not, however, fully offset these higher costs and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases. If such price increases are sustained, they may negatively impact our sales volume, which can in turn negatively impact our margins and profitability. If competitors do not adjust their prices or if consumers decide not to pay higher prices and forego purchasing certain of our products or switch to 'private label' or lower-priced product offerings, sales declines, a deterioration in our profitability and loss of market share may occur which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See 'Our business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities' above for additional information.\n\n## There is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.\n\nOne way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect ex penses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. The achievement of our funding-the-growth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unex pected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our ex pected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected.

Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies. The Company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.\n\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See 'Results of Operations' above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end ex change rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its ex posures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.\n\nBased on year-end 2024 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest expense by $3 in 2024.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material ex posures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill's Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.",

      "answer": "In 2024, the Eurasia market reported an operating profit of $228 million, a decline from $254 million in 2023, despite an organic sales growth of 13.3%. This suggests that while sales increased, profitability was negatively impacted, potentially due to higher costs or unfavorable market conditions.",

      "answer": "The Target Credit Card plays a dual role in driving incremental sales and contributing to deferred revenue. According to page 23, RedCard usage leads to incremental purchases that are also incremental sales for Target, and guests receive a 5% discount when using a RedCard. Page 46 indicates that the company receives payments based on a percentage of the profits from Target Credit Card and Target MasterCard receivables, and that there was $89 million in deferred revenue related to loyalty programs as of January 29, 2022. Page 5 shows that the RedCard is closely tied to Target\u2019s owned and exclusive brands, such as Market Pantry\u2122, Project 62\u2122, and Opalhouse\u2122, suggesting that the card is a key driver in promoting purchases of these proprietary products. Together, these perspectives illustrate how the Target Credit Card not only supports customer loyalty but also directly impacts revenue and deferred income.",

      "question": "How does Target's reliance on independent contractors through Shipt impact both its digital fulfillment scalability and labor cost structure, especially in comparison to its traditional store-based fulfillment methods?",
      "answer": "Target utilizes Shipt, its wholly owned subsidiary, as a key component of its digital fulfillment model, particularly for same-day delivery options like Shipt, Order Pickup, and Drive Up. According to page 5, merchandise sold through digital channels is delivered via common carriers or through Shipt, which leverages independent contractors for delivery. Page 6 reveals that Shipt is specifically noted as a source of independent contractor engagement, a model that offers labor cost flexibility since these workers are not on Target\u2019s payroll and do not receive the same benefits as traditional employees. This aligns with Target\u2019s broader workforce strategy of employing a mix of full-time, part-time, seasonal, and contract labor to manage cost and capacity fluctuations. Page 22 further reinforces Shipt\u2019s operational importance by listing it as a fulfillment method for digitally originated sales. The use of independent contractors through Shipt likely lowers fixed labor costs and enables rapid scalability during peak demand periods, but may also introduce variability in service quality and limit control over delivery execution compared to in-house logistics.",

        "Hop 1: [TGT](page_6) \u2192 [Shipt]: Shipt is specifically mentioned as a source of independent contractor engagement, supporting flexible labor cost structures.",

We are among the largest private employers in the United States (U.S.), and our workforce has varying goals and expectations of their employment relationship, from team members looking to build a career to students, retirees and others who are seeking to supplement their income in an enjoyable atmosphere. We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and  retain  top  talent  no  matter  their  objectives  in  seeking  employment.  To  that  end,  we  strive  to  foster  an  engaged,  diverse, inclusive, safe, purpose-driven culture where employees, referred to as \"team members,\" have equitable opportunities for success.\n\nAs of January 29, 2022, we employed approximately 450,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal team members. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, employment levels peak in the holiday season. We also engage independent contractors, most notably in our Shipt subsidiary.\n\nOur  Board  of  Directors,  through  the  Compensation  and  Human  Capital  Management  Committee,  oversees  human  capital management matters.\n\n## Talent Development and Engagement\n\nWe offer a compelling work environment with meaningful experiences and abundant growth and career-development opportunities. This  starts  with  the  opportunity  to  do  challenging  work  and  learn  on  the  job  and  is  supplemented  by  programs  and  continuous learning  that  help  our  team  build  skills  at  all  levels,  including  programs  focused  on  specialized  skill  development,  leadership opportunities, coaching, and mentoring. Our talent and succession planning process supports the development of a diverse talent pipeline for leadership and other critical roles. We monitor our team members' perceptions of these commitments through a number of surveys and take steps to address areas needing improvement.\n\n## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWe embrace diversity and strive to give our team members equitable access to opportunities. We champion workplace diversity and an  inclusive  work  environment  with  a  focus  on  attracting,  engaging,  developing  and  advancing  diverse  talent.  We  monitor  the representation of women and racially or ethnically diverse team members at different levels throughout the company and disclose the composition of our team in our annual Workforce Diversity Report (which includes demographic information using the categories disclosed in our EEO-1 report). Developing teams where team members feel heard, respected, and included is a core Target value and is fundamental to creating an inclusive guest experience.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our team members and their families. We believe in paying team members equitably, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, and we regularly review the pay data of U.S. team members to confirm that we are doing so. Our compensation packages include a starting wage of at least $15 per hour for U.S. hourly team members (who comprise the vast majority of our team), a 401(k) plan with matching contributions up to five percent of eligible earnings, paid vacation and holidays, family leave, merchandise and other discounts, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare and dependent care flexible spending accounts, debt-free education assistance and tuition reimbursement, free  mental  health  services,  an  annual  short-term  incentive  program,  long-term  equity  awards,  and  health  insurance  benefits, including free virtual health care visits.

      "answer": "Target's apparel segment is a core part of its retail operations, with sales recognized net of expected returns, as evidenced by the $165 million liability for estimated returns as of January 29, 2022. This reflects the company's commitment to customer satisfaction through extended return policies, especially for owned and exclusive brands. Apparel sales are increasingly fulfilled through digitally originated channels, with stores playing a central role in fulfillment methods like Order Pickup, Drive Up, and Shipt. This omnichannel approach implies a dependency on store infrastructure and logistics coordination, which in turn relies on supply chain partners to maintain inventory availability and timely delivery. Thus, the financial treatment of returns, the operational role of stores in digital fulfillment, and supply chain dependencies are interlinked in supporting the apparel business.",

(e)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Total revenues do not include sales tax because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for  collecting  and  remitting  sales  taxes.  Generally,  guests  may  return  national  brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase. Sales are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns. As of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the liability for estimated returns was $165 million and $139 million, respectively.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer. Merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in Inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards  do  not  expire.  Based  on  historical  redemption  rates,  a  small  and  relatively  stable  percentage  of  gift  cards  will  never  be redeemed,  referred  to  as  \"breakage.\"  Estimated  breakage  revenue  is  recognized  over  time  in  proportion  to  actual  gift  card redemptions.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

Despite these risks, Costco is actively pursuing growth in private-label sales, emphasizing high quality and lower prices compared to national brands. However, supply constraints, supplier adherence to quality standards, and cost volatility could hinder this growth strategy, especially if Costco cannot pass on increased costs without affecting consumer demand.

Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nPrices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail  operations,  are  historically  volatile  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and international  supply  and  demand,  inflationary  pressures,  labor  costs,  competition,  market  speculation,  government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations  and  financial  results.  General  economic  conditions  can  also  be  affected  by  events  like  the  outbreak  of hostilities, including but not limited to the Ukraine conflict, or acts of terrorism.\n\nInflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices  to  sufficiently  offset  the  effect  of  the  various  cost  increases  without  negatively  impacting  consumer  demand. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment.\n\nSuppliers  may  be  unable  to  timely  supply  us  with  quality  merchandise  at  competitive  prices  or  may  fail  to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.\n\nWe depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits.\n\nWe  buy  from  numerous  domestic  and  foreign  manufacturers  and  importers.  Our  inability  to  acquire  suitable merchandise  on  acceptable  terms  or  the  loss  of  key  suppliers  could  negatively  affect  us.  We  may  not  be  able  to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.\n\nOur suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable  merchandise.  One  or  more  of  our  suppliers  might  not  adhere  to  our  quality  control,  packaging,  legal, regulatory,  labor,  environmental  or  animal  welfare  standards.  These  deficiencies  may  delay  or  preclude  delivery  of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of  our  supply  chains  and  delivery  channels.  The  effectiveness  of  these  investments  can  be  less  predictable  than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.\n\n## Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nMembership  loyalty  and  growth  are  essential  to  our  business.  The  extent  to  which  we  achieve  growth  in  our membership  base,  increase  the  penetration  of  Executive  membership,  and  sustain  high  renewal  rates  materially influences  our  profitability.  Damage  to  our  brands  or  reputation  may  negatively  impact  comparable  sales,  diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.\n\nWe sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and  availability  of  these  products  is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.\n\n## Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.\n\nWe  depend  on  the  orderly  operation  of  the  merchandise  receiving  and  distribution  process,  primarily  through  our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due  to  fires,  tornadoes,  hurricanes,  earthquakes,  pandemics  or  other  extreme  weather  conditions  or  catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend  heavily  on  third-party  and  in-house  logistics  providers  and  is  negatively  affected  when  these  providers  are unable to provide services in a timely fashion.\n\n## We  may  not  timely  identify  or  effectively  respond  to  consumer  trends,  which  could  negatively  affect  our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  consistently  and  successfully  predict  the  products  and  services  that  our  members  will  desire.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.\n\n## Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations.\n\nIT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions,  conduct  payment  transactions,  track  and  value  our  inventory  and  produce  reports  critical  for  making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to  our  warehouses  and  sell  products  to  our  members.  We  are  undertaking  large  technology  and  IT  transformation projects. The failure of these",

We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products  are  high  quality,  offered  at  prices  that  are  generally  lower  than  national  brands,  and  help  lower  costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.\n\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur U.S. website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge,  our Annual  Reports  on  Form  10-K,  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q,  Current  Reports  on  Form  8-K,  Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with or furnishing such documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\n\nWe have a code of ethics for senior financial officers, pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available free of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027. If the Company makes any amendments to this code (other than technical, administrative, or non-substantive amendments) or grants any waivers, including implicit waivers, to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or principal accounting officer and controller, we will disclose (on our website or in a Form 8-K report filed with the SEC) the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date, and to whom it applies.",

      "answer": "Costco repaid the 2.300% Senior Notes on December 1, 2021, prior to maturity, which directly contributed to a decrease in interest expense for 2022.

      "question": "How does the growth in revenue and operating performance of Costco's 'Other International' markets in 2022 compare to the expansion in employee headcount in those regions, and what does this suggest about the company's investment strategy in those markets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Costco's 'Other International' markets generated $29,985 million in revenue, reflecting a 10% increase from 2021, with operating income rising to $1,179 million. This revenue growth was supported by an increase in employee headcount in these markets to 52,000 in 2022 from 49,000 in 2021. The 3% increase in employees aligns with the 10% revenue growth and suggests that Costco is strategically investing in staffing to support international expansion, while maintaining relatively stable operating margins despite the geographic diversification.",

      "question": "How does Costco's quantitative exposure to forward foreign-exchange contracts in 2022, as reflected in asset/liability positions, align with their qualitative discussion of foreign currency risk management and the notional amounts of open contracts?",
      "answer": "Costco's balance sheet shows a $34M asset position and a $2M liability position in forward foreign-exchange contracts as of 2022, indicating a net economic hedge. This aligns with their qualitative description of using these contracts to economically hedge foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases, primarily U.S. dollar-denominated expenditures by international subsidiaries. Additionally, the notional value of open contracts was $1,242M at the end of 2022, showing the scale of their hedging activity. The relatively small net asset position compared to the large notional amount suggests that the fair value of these contracts was close to par, consistent with their statement that unrealized gains or losses were immaterial.",

Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  (the  captive)  and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted  and  are  estimated,  in  part,  by  considering  historical  claims  experience,  demographic  factors,  severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2022 and 2021, these insurance liabilities were $1,364 and $1,257 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.\n\nThe captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company's premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a participating members' individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact  of  fluctuations  of  foreign  exchange  on  known  future  expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreigncurrency. The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventory  expenditures  made  by  the  Company's international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for  derivative  hedge  accounting. The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  risk  with  the  use  of  these  contracts  and  does  not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative  instruments  in  a  net  liability  position  and  the  amount  needed  to  settle  the  instruments  immediately  if  the credit-risk-related  contingent  features  were  triggered  were  immaterial  at  the  end  of  2022.  There  were  no  derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange  contracts  were  $1,242  and  $1,331  at  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  See  Note  3  for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe  unrealized  gains  or  losses  recognized  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the  accompanying  consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  prices  for  energy,  particularly  electricity  and  natural  gas,  and  other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of",

Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries' investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers' acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.\n\nA 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2022 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to  fluctuations  in  market  volatility  and  interest  rates  are  reflected  within  stockholders'  equity  in  accumulated  other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2022, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,590. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nOur foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency.  The  contracts  are  intended  primarily  to  economically  hedge  exposure  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange  contracts,  see  Notes  1  and  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2022, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $128 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the 'normal purchases and normal sales' exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.",

      "answer": "MDLZ recorded a $767 million net benefit in 2019 due to the Swiss Tax Reform, primarily from a deferred tax expense reduction of $769 million related to an allowed step-up of intangible assets (recorded net of valuation allowance). However, by the end of 2021, the company maintained a total pre-tax loss carryforward of $2,935 million, which includes Swiss valuation allowances tied to the same reform. In the effective tax rate reconciliation, the Swiss Tax Reform contributed a -22.3% reduction in the effective tax rate for 2019, reflecting the significant positive impact of the reform in that year.

Income Taxes\n\nOn August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal/Cantonal events, it is our position that enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter of 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes (recorded net of valuation allowance) and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. With the acquisition of Chipita in January 2022 (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures ), we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a significant portion of the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the step-up of intangible assets will no longer be needed. The amount of the valuation allowance to be released in 2022 is dependent on the increase in Switzerland's future taxable income.\n\nEarnings/(losses) from continuing operations before income taxes and the provision for income taxes consisted of:\n\n",

      "answer": "MDLZ's financial treatment of the JDE Peet's transaction reflects both strategic divestiture and continued operational influence. In 2020, MDLZ reduced its ownership from 26.5% to 22.9% through a share sale, recognizing a net gain of $131 million, indicating a capital strategy to monetize its stake while retaining significant influence (page_104). The transaction also had tax implications, as noted in the earnings per share section, where taxes related to the JDE Peet's transaction were included in costs associated with the transaction (page_56). Additionally, the restructuring program footnotes indicate that the JDE Peet's transaction was significant enough to warrant separate disclosure under equity method investments, highlighting its materiality in MDLZ\u2019s broader portfolio realignment (page_74). Together, these perspectives show a coordinated financial and strategic move to reduce exposure while maintaining influence through the equity method accounting.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn March 4, 2020, we participated in a secondary offering of KDP shares and sold approximately 6.8 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 0.5% to 13.1% of the total outstanding shares. We received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2020.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $23 million (or $18 million after-tax) related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%.\n\n## JDE Peet's Transaction:\n\nIn May 2020, JDE Peet's B.V. (renamed JDE Peet's N.V. immediately prior to Settlement (as defined below), 'JDE Peet's') consummated the offering, listing and trading of its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam, a regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V. In connection with this transaction, JDE Peet's and the selling shareholders, including us, agreed to sell at a price of \u20ac31.50 per ordinary share a total of approximately 82.1 million ordinary shares, including ordinary shares subject to an over-allotment option. The ordinary shares were listed and first traded on May 29, 2020, and payment for, and delivery of, the ordinary shares sold in the offering (excluding ordinary shares subject to the over-allotment option) took place on June 2, 2020 ('Settlement').\n\nPrior to Settlement, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet's. We did not invest new capital in connection with the transaction and the exchange was accounted for as a change in interest transaction. Upon Settlement, we sold approximately 9.7 million of our ordinary shares in JDE Peet's in the offering for gross proceeds of \u20ac304 million ($343 million). We subsequently sold approximately 1.4 million additional shares and received gross proceeds of \u20ac46 million ($51 million) upon exercise of the over-allotment option. Following Settlement and the exercise of the over-allotment option, we held a 22.9% equity interest in JDE Peet's. During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded a preliminary gain of $121 million, net of $33 million released from accumulated other comprehensive losses, and $48 million of transaction costs. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million.\n\nOn September 20, 2021, we issued \u20ac300 million exchangeable bonds, which are redeemable at maturity at their principal amount in cash or, at our option, through the delivery of an equivalent number of JDE Peet's ordinary shares based on an initial exchange price of \u20ac35.40 and, as the case may be, an additional amount in cash. If all bonds were redeemed in exchange for JDE Peet's shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately 7% of our equity interest in JDE Peet's. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for further details on this transaction.\n\nAs was the case in our ownership interest in JDE, we have significant influence with respect to JDE Peet's, and we will continue to account for our investment in JDE Peet's under the equity method, resulting in recognizing our share of JDE Peet's earnings within our earnings and our share of JDE Peet's dividends within our cash flows.\n\n## Summary Financial Information for Equity Method Investments:\n\nSummarized financial information related to our equity method investments is reflected below.\n\n",

As of December 31, 2021, the notional value of these NIH derivatives was $3.9 billion, directly hedging exposure to exchange rate fluctuations (page_114). These instruments are accounted for as part of the company\u2019s comprehensive risk management strategy and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with assets and liabilities appearing in other current/non-current sections of the consolidated balance sheet (page_111). The company expects to transfer $28 million in losses from accumulated other comprehensive earnings into earnings over the next 12 months, indicating a measurable near-term impact on earnings from these hedging activities (page_114).

We received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2020.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $23 million (or $18 million after-tax) related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%.\n\n## JDE Peet's Transaction:\n\nIn May 2020, JDE Peet's B.V. (renamed JDE Peet's N.V. immediately prior to Settlement (as defined below), 'JDE Peet's') consummated the offering, listing and trading of its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam, a regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V. In connection with this transaction, JDE Peet's and the selling shareholders, including us, agreed to sell at a price of \u20ac31.50 per ordinary share a total of approximately 82.1 million ordinary shares, including ordinary shares subject to an over-allotment option. The ordinary shares were listed and first traded on May 29, 2020, and payment for, and delivery of, the ordinary shares sold in the offering (excluding ordinary shares subject to the over-allotment option) took place on June 2, 2020 ('Settlement').\n\nPrior to Settlement, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet's. We did not invest new capital in connection with the transaction and the exchange was accounted for as a change in interest transaction. Upon Settlement, we sold approximately 9.7 million of our ordinary shares in JDE Peet's in the offering for gross proceeds of \u20ac304 million ($343 million). We subsequently sold approximately 1.4 million additional shares and received gross proceeds of \u20ac46 million ($51 million) upon exercise of the over-allotment option. Following Settlement and the exercise of the over-allotment option, we held a 22.9% equity interest in JDE Peet's. During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded a preliminary gain of $121 million, net of $33 million released from accumulated other comprehensive losses, and $48 million of transaction costs. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million.\n\nOn September 20, 2021, we issued \u20ac300 million exchangeable bonds, which are redeemable at maturity at their principal amount in cash or, at our option, through the delivery of an equivalent number of JDE Peet's ordinary shares based on an initial exchange price of \u20ac35.40 and, as the case may be, an additional amount in cash. If all bonds were redeemed in exchange for JDE Peet's shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately 7% of our equity interest in JDE Peet's. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for further details on this transaction.\n\nAs was the case in our ownership interest in JDE, we have significant influence with respect to JDE Peet's, and we will continue to account for our investment in JDE Peet's under the equity method, resulting in recognizing our share of JDE Peet's earnings within our earnings and our share of JDE Peet's dividends within our cash flows.\n\n## Summary Financial Information for Equity Method Investments:\n\nSummarized financial information related to our equity method investments is reflected below.\n\n",

During the first quarter of 2020, we finalized the purchase price allocation of $31 million to definite-life intangible assets, $107 million to indefinite-life intangible assets, $150 million to goodwill, $1 million to property, plant and equipment, $12 million to inventory, $8 million to accounts receivable, $13 million to current liabilities, $3 million to deferred tax liabilities and $9 million to other liabilities.

      "question": "How does PepsiCo's treatment of the inflationary cost environment in its accounting estimates, goodwill impairment assessments, and revenue recognition policies collectively reflect the complexity and uncertainty it introduces across financial reporting dimensions?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo acknowledges that the inflationary cost environment significantly complicates its accounting estimates, particularly those involving future cash flows, impairment testing, and revenue recognition. In its accounting estimates (page_69), the company notes that inflationary pressures make it more difficult to calculate estimates such as sales incentives accruals, pension liabilities, and asset impairments. In the context of goodwill and intangible asset valuations (page_59), inflation is cited as a factor influencing discount rates and cash flow projections used in impairment assessments. Finally, in revenue recognition policies (page_57), the inflationary environment is mentioned as a source of business and economic uncertainty that affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition, particularly in relation to marketplace spending and performance-based accruals. Together, these perspectives illustrate how inflation permeates multiple layers of financial reporting, requiring nuanced and interdependent judgments.",

Brand developm ent costs are expensed as incurred. W e also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business com bination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabiliti es, i ncl u di n g  bran ds and other i ntangi bl e assets, based on esti m ated f ai r val ues, wi th any excess recorded as goodwill.

If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not m et, brands are am ortized over  their  expected  useful  lives,  which  generally  range  from   20  to  40  years.  Determ ining  the  expected  life  of  a  brand  requires  m anagem ent judgment and is based on an evaluation of a num ber of factors, including m arket share, consum er awareness, brand history , future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the m acroeconom ic environm ent of the countries in which the brand is sold.\n\nIn connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to m anufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories.

Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are am ortized over the rem aining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.\n\nIndefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  goodwill  are  not  am ortized  and,  as  a  result,  are  assessed  for  im pairm ent  at  l east  annual l y ,  usi ng  ei ther  a qualitative or quantitative approach.

The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any im pact of changes in our assum ptions during the year which reflect m arket conditions over which division m anagem ent has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Pension and Retiree Medical Expense\n\nPension and retiree m edical service costs m easured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determ ine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These com m odity derivatives include agricultural products, m etals, and energy . Com m odity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatm ent are m arked to m arket each period with the resulting gains and l osses  recorded  in  corporate  unallocated  expenses  as  either  cost  of  sales  or  selling,  general  and  adm inistrative  expenses,  depending  on  the underlying com m odity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.

These derivatives hedge underlying com m odity price risk and were not entered i n to f or tradi n g  or specul ati v e pu rposes.\n\n## Net Revenue, Significant Expenses and Operating Profit/(Loss) by Division\n\nOur chief operating decision m aker (CODM) is our Chairm an and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM uses division operating profit/(loss) as the profit m easure to evaluate division perform ance and allocate resources across divisions. Corporate unallocated expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/incom e and net interest expense and other are centrally m anaged costs and are therefore excluded from  this profit measure to provide better transparency of our division operating results. Our CODM considers variances of actual perform ance to our annual operating plan and periodic forecasts when m aking decisions.\n\nSignificant expenses are expenses which are regularly provided to the CODM and are included in division operating profit/(loss).

The settlem ent charge was triggered when the aggregate of the cum ulative lum p sum  distributions and the annuity contract prem ium  exceeded the total annual service and interest costs. Pension and retiree m edical-related im pact also includes curtailm ent losses due to restructuring actions as part of our 2019 Productivity Plan.\n\nSee Notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further inform ation.\n\n## Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available m ethods of debt financing, such as com m ercial paper borrowings and long-term  debt financing, will be adequate to m eet our operating, i n v esti n g   an d  f i n an ci n g   n eeds,  i n cl u di n g   w i th   respect  to  ou r  n et  capi tal   spen di n g   pl an s.  Ou r  pri m ary   sou rces  of   l i qu i di ty   i n cl u de  cash   f rom operations, proceeds obtained from  issuances of com m ercial paper and long-term  debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available  to  fund  cash  outflows  that  have  both  a  short-  and  long-term   com ponent,  including  debt  repaym ents  and  related  interest  paym ents; payments  for  acquisitions;  operating  leases;  purchase,  m arketing,  and  other  contractual  com m itm ents,  including  capital  expenditures  and  the transiti on tax l i abi l i ty  u n der th e T ax  Cu ts an d Jobs Act (TCJ Act). In addi ti on, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. W e do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangem ents, including variable interest entiti es, that we believe could have a m aterial im pact on our liquidity . See 'Item  1A. Risk Factors,' 'Our Business Risks' and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further inform ation.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short-term  investm ents in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not m aterial.\n\nThe TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of Decem ber 28, 2024, our m andatory transiti on  tax  l i abi l i ty   was  $1.7  bi l l i on ,  wh i ch   m u st  be  pai d  th rou g h   2026  u n der  th e  prov i si on s  of   th e  TCJ  Act;  we  cu rren tl y   ex pect  to  pay approximately $772 million of this liability in 2025. Any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) m ay im pact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further discussion of the TCJ Act.\n\nSupply chain financing arrangem ents did not have a m aterial im pact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect  such  arrangem ents  to  have  a  m aterial  im pact  on  our  liquidity  or  capital  resources  for  the  foreseeable  future.  See  Note  14  to  our consolidated financial statem ents for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangem ents.\n\nFurthermore, our cash provided from  operating activities is som ewhat im pacted by seasonality . W orking capital needs are im pacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing  basis,  we  consider  various  transactions  to  increase  shareholder  value  and  enhance  our  business  results,  including  acquisitions, divestitures,  joint  ventures,  dividends,  share  repurchases,  productivity  and  other  efficiency  initiatives  and  other  structural  changes.  These transactions m ay result in future cash proceeds or paym ents.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's TCJ Act obligations, which include $309 million in annual tax payments and a $579 million payment due in 2024, are part of its broader liquidity planning and capital commitments. These obligations are being managed alongside its share repurchase program and debt management strategy, as the company leverages its cash-generating capability, revolving credit facilities, and access to debt markets to maintain financial flexibility. However, the TCJ Act liability\u2014totaling $2.3 billion as of December 30, 2023\u2014represents a significant near-term cash outflow that must be balanced against other capital uses such as dividends, acquisitions, and operational investments.",

      "question": "How does PepsiCo's impairment of the SodaStream brand in 2023 reflect in both its financial performance and strategic risk management, especially considering the heightened risk of future goodwill impairment in Europe?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo recorded $0.6 billion in indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand in 2023, which was driven by a decrease in fair value due to macroeconomic pressures, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and inflationary costs. This impairment, alongside a $0.3 billion goodwill impairment for the SodaStream reporting unit in Europe, significantly impacted the company's financial performance, reducing net income by $0.75 per share. These charges indicate that the SodaStream brand is underperforming relative to strategic expectations and is at heightened risk of further impairment if assumptions around growth or discount rates change. The impairment aligns with the company's qualitative and quantitative risk assessment framework, which considers macroeconomic conditions and strategic brand performance, signaling a potential misalignment between the brand's current trajectory and long-term strategic goals in the European market.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo sold its Tropicana, Naked, and other juice brands to PAI Partners in Q1 2022 for $3.5 billion and received a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG (page_111). Initially, this transaction generated a $520 million gain due to the remeasurement of PepsiCo\u2019s ownership stake at fair value (page_111). However, by the end of the year, PepsiCo recorded impairment charges related to its investment in TBG (page_53), which were further detailed as pre-tax impairment charges on page_74. These impairments indicate a decline in the value of the TBG investment post-transaction, offsetting some of the initial gains and signaling potential underperformance or market challenges faced by TBG, thus affecting PepsiCo\u2019s overall financial results beyond the initial divestiture benefit.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo divested Tropicana and other juice brands in Q1 2022 for $3.5 billion in cash and a 39% noncontrolling interest in Tropicana Brands Group (TBG), which operates across North America and Europe. This transaction resulted in a $520 million gain for PepsiCo, reflecting its financial restructuring. Despite the divestiture, PepsiCo retained exclusive distribution rights for TBG's brands in the U.S. for small-format and foodservice customers via chilled direct-store-delivery (DSD). This arrangement ensures continued operational involvement in Tropicana's distribution while reducing financial ownership, aligning with a strategic pivot that monetizes the brand while maintaining logistical influence.",

      "answer": "Walmart's international segment saw a gross profit rate decline in fiscal 2022 due in part to the divestiture of markets like Asda and Seiyu, but in fiscal 2021, Flipkart contributed to improved margin mix and helped drive positive comparable sales. During fiscal 2022, Walmart received $3.2 billion from new equity funding in Flipkart, which reduced its ownership stake from 83% to 75%, signaling a strategic shift in capital structure. At the same time, Flipkart was highlighted in the business overview as a core component of Walmart\u2019s international eCommerce ecosystem, particularly in India, which suggests that despite reducing ownership, Walmart continues to view Flipkart as strategically critical to its global omni-channel and digital growth strategy.",

For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This decrease was partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.5 billion. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. The pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce in several markets. While several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of government mandates, most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 55 basis points and increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to Flipkart's improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the U.K.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 71 basis points and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to $0.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping a $0.4 billion non-cash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020.\n\nOperating income for fiscal 2022 included a $0.3 billion impact from positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and fiscal 2021 included a $0.2 billion impact from negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.",

(\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") helps people around the world save money and live better - anytime and anywhere - by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 230 million customers who visit more than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 46 banners in 24 countries.\n\nOur strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.\n\nOur operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a onemonth lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\"), January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\") and January 31, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\"). During fiscal 2022, we generated total revenues of $572.8 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $567.8 billion.\n\nWe maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\"\n\n## The Development of Our Company\n\nThe businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2022, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 23 countries.\n\nIn 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and 6,000 delivery locations globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, as well as made several eCommerce acquisitions to better serve our customers. These investments have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives internationally, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.\n\nWe are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and marketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.3 million associates as of January 31, 2022 to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart Fulfillment Services, our health and wellness business, including Walmart Health, and our financial services business. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our flywheel centered around our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.",

      "answer": "Walmart's financial treatment of its pension obligations through Asda involved a $1.0 billion cash contribution to the Asda Group Pension Scheme in fiscal 2020, which was part of a broader agreement to release Asda from future pension liabilities. This pension-related activity contributed to the $2.3 billion of accumulated pension components included in the disposal group when Asda was classified as held for sale in fiscal 2021. In the divestiture, Walmart recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which included the pension components. Additionally, the remeasurement of Asda's pension benefit obligation contributed to a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $0.8 billion, which was released from accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the sale of Walmart's U.K. operations in fiscal 2022. Together, these elements show that Asda's pension obligations had a significant impact on both the impairment evaluation and the final financial outcome of the divestiture.",

      "question": "How has The Coca-Cola Company's exposure to corporate bonds and debt securities changed across its different asset classifications in 2023, and what does this reveal about its shifting investment strategy and risk profile?",
      "answer": "The Coca-Cola Company's exposure to corporate bonds and debt securities decreased significantly in 2023 when comparing year-end values across different asset classifications. On page 101, the total value of corporate bonds and debt securities was reported at $7 million in 2023, down from $71 million in 2022. This decline is further detailed on page 116, where the Level 2 fair value of corporate bonds and debt securities was $7 million in 2023, compared to $71 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in fixed-income exposure within the company's structured investment categories. However, on page 115, the company reported a much larger amount of $579 million for corporate bonds and debt securities in 2023, compared to $499 million in 2022, suggesting that this broader category includes additional investment vehicles beyond those captured in the more narrowly defined sections. This discrepancy reveals a strategic shift toward more complex or diversified fixed-income instruments, while reducing direct holdings of corporate bonds in more liquid asset classifications, potentially signaling a recalibration of risk tolerance and investment focus.",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's geographic segment structure and concentrate operations align with its bottling agreements in terms of the production, sale, and distribution of fountain syrups across different markets?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's concentrate operations, which include the sale of fountain syrups, are integrated within its geographic operating segments and Global Ventures. In North America, the Company directly manufactures and sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers and retailers, while outside the U.S., bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups on a nonexclusive basis. This aligns with the geographic segment structure, where fountain syrup sales in the U.S. are included in the North America segment, and international fountain syrup activities are managed through bottling partners under the respective regional segments. The bottling agreements outside the U.S. generally allow for the nonexclusive production of fountain syrups, whereas in the U.S., the Company retains control over syrup manufacturing and distribution.",

      "question": "How does MDLZ's treatment of equity method investment contracts in derivative disclosures, fair value categorization, and earnings recognition collectively reflect their financial exposure and strategic management of these contracts over time?",
      "answer": "MDLZ's equity method investment contracts are minimally present in derivative disclosures as of the end of 2023, showing no asset or liability derivatives under this category, compared to a $3 million liability in 2022. In terms of fair value categorization, these contracts represented a $3 million liability in 2022, fully categorized under Level 2 inputs with no observable market prices. Over the years 2021\u20132023, the company recognized only minor gains from these contracts, with $7 million in 2023, no gain in 2022, and $2 million in 2021. This collectively suggests that equity method investment contracts play a limited role in MDLZ\u2019s derivative risk profile, financial structuring, and earnings impact, indicating a low strategic emphasis or exposure.",

      "answer": "The $507 million revenue contribution from Ricolino in 2023 demonstrates early financial impact from the acquisition, which was purchased for $1.3 billion in November 2022. However, MDLZ explicitly cautions in their forward-looking statements that 'our ability to identify, complete, manage and realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions' includes the Ricolino acquisition. This indicates that while Ricolino contributed meaningfully to 2023 revenue growth, the company acknowledges significant execution risk in capturing the anticipated long-term value from the $1.3 billion investment.",

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z's investment in JDE Peet's is highlighted as a source of liquidity and financial flexibility (page_54), which is reinforced by the active management of its equity stake\u2014evidenced by the 2023 sale of 9.9 million shares, reducing ownership from 19.7% to 17.7% and generating \u20ac255 million in proceeds (page_88). Despite this, the company recorded a \u20ac21 million loss on the transaction, which contrasts with the $184 million gain on equity method investment transactions reported in the income statement (page_48). This suggests that while the JDE Peet's stake contributes to capital flexibility through partial exits, the financial impact of these transactions is mixed, with both gains and losses influencing reported performance.",

      "question": "How does Mondel\u0113z's acquisition investment in Clif Bar, its forward-looking strategic risk disclosures, and the updated contingent consideration liability collectively reflect the financial and strategic exposure associated with the acquisition?",
      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z's acquisition of Clif Bar for $2.9 billion, including $2.6 billion in purchase price and $0.3 billion in one-time compensation expense, highlights a significant upfront investment aimed at expanding its global snack bar business. This strategic move is accompanied by forward-looking risk disclosures that specifically flag the uncertainty around realizing the expected benefits, cost savings, or synergies from the acquisition, noting that macroeconomic, geopolitical, and operational risks could materially impact outcomes. Further, the contingent consideration liability for Clif Bar was updated to $548 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting ongoing financial exposure tied to performance targets through 2025 and 2026. Together, these elements show that while Mondel\u0113z sees strategic value in Clif Bar, it also faces substantial financial and operational risks in capturing the full anticipated benefit from the acquisition.",

This aligns with the region's employee distribution, as 5% of the company's global workforce is based in Africa/Eurasia.

      "question": "How does Colgate-Palmolive's use of sourcing strategies to manage raw material price volatility compare with its broader risk management framework involving foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, and how are these strategies quantitatively and qualitatively addressed in the company's financial disclosures?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive employs sourcing strategies as a key mechanism to manage raw material price volatility, particularly for commodities like resins, essential oils, and agricultural products, as noted in the fair value disclosures related to commodity contracts. These strategies are complemented by the use of limited hedging instruments, primarily futures contracts in the Hill's Pet Nutrition segment, with durations under 12 months. In the broader context of risk management, the company similarly utilizes sourcing strategies alongside financial instruments like foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The foreign currency contracts, valued using Level 2 inputs, are used across over 200 markets to hedge exposures related to purchases, assets, and liabilities, with a reported net unrealized loss of $13 at year-end 2023. Interest rate swaps are aligned with debt issuance profiles to maintain a targeted fixed-to-floating rate mix. The integration of sourcing strategies within this multi-dimensional risk management framework reflects a consistent approach to mitigating market volatility across different asset classes, with sourcing strategies serving as a foundational, non-financial instrument tool across all exposures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CL](page_92) \u2192 [Sourcing Strategies]: The company manages raw material exposures through sourcing strategies, cost containment, and limited commodity hedging, with futures contracts primarily used in the Hill's Pet Nutrition segment (Level 1 valuation), and durations under 12 months.",
        "Hop 2: [CL](page_91) \u2192 [Sourcing Strategies]: Sourcing strategies are part of a broader global market risk management framework that includes foreign currency contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity contracts, all aligned with treasury and risk policies that prohibit speculative use of derivatives.",
        "Hop 3: [CL](page_55) \u2192 [Sourcing Strategies]: Sourcing strategies are used in conjunction with foreign exchange contracts (including forwards, swaps, and options) and interest rate swaps to manage exposures across over 200 countries, with a reported net unrealized loss of $13 on foreign currency contracts at year-end 2023."

On page 55, the company expands on cost containment in the context of foreign exchange risk, where it is used alongside foreign currency contracts, which carried a net unrealized loss of $13 in 2023 and could result in a $100 loss from a 10% unfavorable exchange rate shift. Together, these sections show that while cost containment is a consistent operational lever, the company relies more heavily on financial hedging instruments for foreign exchange than for commodities, with differing financial impacts and risk sensitivities.",

Financially, the company accounts for trade promotions offered to these customers as a reduction of sales, with accruals for expected payouts included in accrued marketing and promotion expenses (page 42). This financial treatment aligns with management's strategic emphasis on maintaining strong customer relationships across diverse sales channels, including Specialty Beauty Stores, to sustain market share and growth (page 17).

Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNOTE 1\n\n## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter &amp; Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior  quality  and  value.  Our  products  are  sold  in  about 180  countries  and  territories  primarily  through  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n\n## Use of E stimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,  consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax  positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although  management  does  not  generally  believe  such  differences  would  materially  affect  the  financial  statements  in  any  individual  year.  However,  regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing  allowances,  merchandising  funds  and  consumer  coupons,  are  offered  through  various  programs  to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative E xpense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG &amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print, radio, digital and in-store advertising ex penses and were $9.6 billion in 2024, $8.0 billion in 2023 and $7.9 billion in 2022. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&amp;A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\n\n## Other Non-Operating Income, Net\n\nOther non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income, accumulated foreign currency translation losses and other non-operating items.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherw ise specified.",

References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of  the  reporting  period.  Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales.  Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nP&amp;G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.  Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-theground operations in about 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; G rooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

      "question": "How does Procter & Gamble's strategic reliance on membership club stores as a key sales channel align with their financial reporting on revenue recognition and cost pressures, and how might supply chain risks affect this channel's contribution to profitability?",
      "answer": "Procter & Gamble identifies membership club stores as a major retail channel through which they sell products, alongside mass merchandisers and e-commerce platforms (page_7 and page_17). According to the financial statements (page_42), revenue is recognized at the point of sale with provisions made for trade promotions and returns, which are critical in managing relationships with large retail customers like membership club stores. The company also faces cost pressures from fluctuating commodity prices and supply chain disruptions (page_7), which could impact margins if not offset through pricing or cost-saving initiatives. Since membership club stores operate on thin margins and demand competitive pricing and consistent supply, any disruption in the supply chain\u2014such as those caused by trade policy shifts or natural disasters\u2014could strain this channel\u2019s performance. Thus, the company must balance maintaining favorable trade terms with these retailers while managing rising input costs and ensuring supply chain resilience to sustain profitability through this channel.",

Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly ex ceed their underlying carrying values.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax ) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nWhile we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge.\n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\n\nNet sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our G illette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the G illette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency  exchange  rates  and  business  activities  that  impact  market  share. As  a  result,  the  residual  growth  rates  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\n\nThe discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\n\nThe royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.",

Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability). Significant judgment by management is required to estimate the impact of macroeconomic and other factors on future cash flows. Estimates utilized in the projected cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\n\nWe believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.

In connection with this announcement, the Company announced that it expected to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to $1.5 billion after tax , consisting primarily of foreign currency translation losses to be recognized as non-cash charges upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax  for accumulated currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges were funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs were reported as non-core charges. For more details on the restructuring program, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Intangible Asset Impairment\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge on an indefinite-lived intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The G illette Company. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above.

To maintain strong relationships with department store customers, P&G records trade promotions as a reduction of sales and accrues for expected payouts under these programs. These provisions are significant, as trade promotions are a major component of the company's selling, general, and administrative expenses, which totaled $9.6 billion in 2024.

Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNOTE 1\n\n## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter &amp; Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior  quality  and  value.  Our  products  are  sold  in  about 180  countries  and  territories  primarily  through  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n\n## Use of E stimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,  consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax  positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although  management  does  not  generally  believe  such  differences  would  materially  affect  the  financial  statements  in  any  individual  year.  However,  regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing  allowances,  merchandising  funds  and  consumer  coupons,  are  offered  through  various  programs  to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative E xpense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG &amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print, radio, digital and in-store advertising ex penses and were $9.6 billion in 2024, $8.0 billion in 2023 and $7.9 billion in 2022. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&amp;A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\n\n## Other Non-Operating Income, Net\n\nOther non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income, accumulated foreign currency translation losses and other non-operating items.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherw ise specified.",

References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of  the  reporting  period.  Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales.  Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nP&amp;G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.  Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-theground operations in about 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; G rooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive utilizes sourcing strategies as part of a multi-pronged approach to manage foreign exchange and commodity price risks, which is closely aligned with its treasury and risk management policies that emphasize non-speculative derivative usage and fair value transparency. On page 52, the company notes that sourcing strategies are used alongside cost-containment measures and hedging to manage foreign exchange exposure, with foreign currency contracts resulting in a net unrealized gain of $12 at year-end 2021. Page 90 adds that sourcing strategies are also applied to manage commodity price volatility, particularly for raw materials like essential oils and soybeans, with limited futures contracts used mainly in the Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition segment. Page 89 further contextualizes this by explaining that these sourcing strategies are part of a broader framework that includes derivative instruments valued using observable market rates (Level 2) and a strict policy against speculative derivatives. Together, these sections show that sourcing strategies are a foundational, non-financial tool within a coordinated risk management approach that integrates both operational and financial hedging techniques.",

Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies. The Company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.\n\nThe sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See 'Results of Operations' above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.\n\nThe Company's foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $12 and net unrealized loss of $11 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2021, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $76.",

The Company utilizes forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

          "chunk_text": "In 2019, we received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in Brazil. As a result of this favorable judgment, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we filed an application with the Brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit. In May 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a clarifying ruling allowing a higher deduction of state value-added tax when determining the taxable base. In light of this ruling, we recorded an additional benefit of $26 pretax ($20 aftertax) in the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a multi-year restructuring program, concluded on December 31, 2019. Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program fit within the program's three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program to reflect our revised estimate of remaining liabilities, which resulted in a reduction of $16 ($13 aftertax) to restructuring accruals. For more information regarding the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, see Note 4, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. As described more fully in 'Results of Operations-Income Taxes,' below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 'TCJA').\n\nOn January 31, 2020, we acquired Hello Products LLC ('hello'), an oral care business, for cash consideration of $351. The acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash. This acquisition is part of our strategy to focus on high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, especially due to COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. We also incurred increased logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry and higher eCommerce demand. We expect this difficult cost environment to continue in 2022.\n\nWhile the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion.\n\nWe have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain environmental, sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. These trends have been magnified due to COVID-19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses, such as eCommerce. This rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.\n\nIn addition, given that approximately 70% of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations. As discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material and logistics costs. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and our funding the growth and revenue growth management initiatives, including additional pricing, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.",

          "chunk_text": "by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain environmental, supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, 'private label' products sold by our retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nFurther, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-customer (DTC) businesses. These trends accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. If we are not successful in continuing to adapt or to effectively react to changes in consumer preferences, purchasing patterns and market dynamics and/or expanding sales through eCommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels, including the profitable expansion of our own DTC capabilities, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## The growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.\n\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies. Our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully:\n\n- identify, develop and fund technological innovations;\n- obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others;\n- obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad; and\n- anticipate and quickly respond to the needs and preferences of consumers and customers.\n\nThe identification, development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort, and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. In addition, new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace.\n\nOur ability to quickly innovate to adapt and market our products and to adapt our packaging to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy. The failure to develop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging and supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIf, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if we are not found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.",

      "question": "Given CL's relatively low identifiable assets and program charges in Eurasia compared to other regions, but strong organic sales growth in the same region, how might these conflicting signals influence CL's future capital allocation strategy for Eurasia?",
      "answer": "CL's identifiable assets in Eurasia were only $599 million in 2021 (page_118), and Eurasia accounted for just 5% of total program charges (page_84), indicating limited investment in the region. However, Eurasia achieved 7.0% organic sales growth (page_48), outperforming several larger regions like Europe (-0.5%) and matching Asia Pacific (3.0%). This combination of low investment but relatively strong growth suggests Eurasia may offer disproportionate returns compared to other markets. Given this, CL may consider increasing investment in Eurasia to capitalize on the region's growth potential, especially if current low spending is seen as a constraint on even higher growth. However, the company might also evaluate whether the existing market dynamics or operational structure justify maintaining or reducing focus on the region depending on longer-term strategic goals.",

Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. Certain of our products are also sold direct-to-consumer. Our sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 12% of our Net sales in 2021. No other customer represents more than 10% of our Net sales. We support our products with advertising, promotion and other marketing (with increasing emphasis on digital) to build awareness and trial of our products. Our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers.\n\nThe majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products are purchased from other companies and is available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of our total material requirements. We do, however, purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. For certain materials, however, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Item 1A, 'Risk Factors - Volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability' and Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the rapid growth of eCommerce, the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of largeformat retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. Products similar to those that we produce and sell are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. In certain geographies, we also face strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do. Private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nThe retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. These trends have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail. We also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals as well as a shift, in many markets, to purchasing our products online. We face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new product and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. Product quality, innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products and brands largely determine success in Colgate's operating segments.\n\nWe consider trademarks to be of material importance to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where our products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso, Tom's of Maine, EltaMD, Filorga, Irish Spring, Lady Speed Stick, PCA SKIN, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Murphy, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill's Science Diet and Hill's Prescription Diet. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although we actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.",

In addition, 'private label' products sold by our retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nFurther, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-customer (DTC) businesses. These trends accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. If we are not successful in continuing to adapt or to effectively react to changes in consumer preferences, purchasing patterns and market dynamics and/or expanding sales through eCommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels, including the profitable expansion of our own DTC capabilities, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## The growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.\n\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies. Our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully:\n\n- identify, develop and fund technological innovations;\n- obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others;\n- obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad; and\n- anticipate and quickly respond to the needs and preferences of consumers and customers.\n\nThe identification, development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort, and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. In addition, new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace.\n\nOur ability to quickly innovate to adapt and market our products and to adapt our packaging to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy. The failure to develop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging and supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIf, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if we are not found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.",

This aligns with the business risks section (page 11), which outlines strategic priorities and regulatory hurdles, including the potential for mischaracterization of RRPs and restrictive WHO policy recommendations. These risks are contrasted with the company's significant capital investment in RRPs (page 64), where $0.7 billion was spent in 2021 alone, signaling a strong commitment despite acknowledged uncertainties.

We do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.\n\n## Overall Business Risks\n\n## We may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or the communication of scientifically substantiated information and claims.\n\nOur key strategic priorities are to: (i) develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and (ii) convince and educate current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those RRPs. For our efforts to be successful, we must:\n\n- develop RRPs that adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking;\n- conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking; and\n- effectively advocate for a timely development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs, including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices.\n\nWe might not succeed in our efforts. If we do not succeed, but others do, or if heat-not-burn products are inequitably regulated compared to other  RRP  categories  without  regard  to  the  totality  of  the  scientific  evidence  available  for  such  products,  we  may  be  at  a  competitive disadvantage. In addition, actions of some market entrants, such as the inappropriate marketing of e-vapor products to youth, as well as alleged  health  consequences  associated  with  the  use  of  certain  e-vapor  products,  may  unfavorably  impact  public  opinion  and/or mischaracterize all e-vapor products or other RRPs to consumers, regulators and policy makers without regard to the totality of scientific evidence for specific products. This may impede our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs. We cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of RRPs with scientifically substantiated information and claims. Such restrictions could limit the success of our RRPs.\n\nThe WHO study group on tobacco product regulation (\"TobReg\") published their eighth report on the scientific basis of tobacco product regulation in May 2021. The report is based on a review of scientific evidence related to novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products, such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (\"ENDS\"), electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (\"ENNDS\") and heated tobacco products (\"HTPs\") on a number of scientific topics. The report concludes by making a number of policy recommendations on HTPs and ENDS that, if implemented, could restrict both the availability of these products, and the access to accurate information about them. In August 2021, the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports to the ninth session of the Conference of the Parties (\"CoP\") of the FCTC, which are not materially different from the WHO study group report.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nAdditionally, any claims, regardless of merit, challenging our research and clinical data available to date, may impact the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of the RRP category and the commercialization of the RRP category in general.\n\nOur RRPs and commercial activities for these products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and users of nicotinecontaining products, and not for non-smokers or youth. We put significant effort in place to restrict access of our products to non-smokers or  youth.  Nevertheless,  technological,  regulatory  and/or  commercial  setbacks  might  prevent  us  from  delivering  necessary  infrastructure required to fulfill our commitment of having 100% of our RRP device portfolio equipped with 'Age Verification'-technology and device activation features by 2023.",

Acquisitions and Item 8, Note 15. Financial Instruments.\n\nOur capital expenditures were $0.7 billion in 2021 and $0.6 billion in 2020. The 2021 expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in RRPs. We expect total capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately $1.0 billion (including capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in RRPs), to be funded by operating cash flows.\n\n## \u00b7 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities of $12.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased by $3.5 billion from the comparable 2020 period. The change was primarily due to the proceeds we received in 2020 from long-term U.S. dollar debt issuances ($3.7 billion), share purchases in 2021 under the new share repurchase program and higher dividend payments, partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt and lower payments to noncontrolling interests.\n\nDividends paid in 2021 and 2020 were $7.6 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our net cash activities (operating, investing and financing) for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7.

As a policy, we  do  not  hold  any  investments  in  structured  or  equity-linked  products.  Our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  predominantly  held  with institutions  that  have  investment-grade  long-term  credit  rating.  As  part  of  our  cash  management  strategy  and  in  order  to  manage counterparty exposure, we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements. Such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and, at maturity, cash is paid back to PMI, and the collateral is returned to the bank. For 2021 and 2020, the activities for such reverse repurchase agreements were not material.\n\nIn  August  2021,  we  published  a  business  transformation-linked  financing  framework  ('Framework'),  which  integrates  the  company's smoke-free  transformation  into  its  financing  strategy.  The  Framework  outlines  the  guidelines  that  we  will  follow  in  issuing  business transformation-linked  financing  instruments  in  the  debt  capital  and  loan  markets,  which  may  include  public  notes  offerings,  private placements, loans, and other relevant financing instruments.\n\nCredit Ratings -The cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings.

The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\n\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n\n- We started commercializing an improved version of our IQOS MESH product in Canada, Corsica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ukraine and New Zealand under the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand names. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets.\n- With respect to TEEPS , our Platform 2 product, we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\n- Following the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n- We launched  a  Platform  5  product  in  Sweden  in  January  2022,  that  is  a  reformulated  version  of  the  already  commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the Shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed.\n\nRRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are  likely  to  present,  or  have  the  potential  to  present  less  risk  of  harm  to  adult  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continued smoking and should recognize  a  continuum  of  risk  for  tobacco  and  other  nicotine-containing  products.  Regulation,  as  well  as  industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\n\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\n\nThese  regulations  might  foreclose  or  unreasonably  restrict  adult  consumer  access  even  to  products  that  might  be  shown  to  be  a  better consumer  choice  than  continuing  to  smoke.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  some  governments  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be temporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\n\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\n\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing 'Modified Risk Tobacco Products' and 'New Tobacco Products' exists  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FDA.  We  submitted  to  the  FDA  a  Modified  Risk  Tobacco  Product Application  ('MRTPA')  for  our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ('PMTA') for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.",

          "chunk_text": "study indicate that these products are an effective means of nicotine delivery while being a satisfying alternative for e-cigarette users. In March 2019, a six-month pre-clinical study in mice evaluating the impact of e-cigarette vapor on the risks of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease compared to cigarette smoke was completed; this study did not pertain to a specific product. The study demonstrated that e-cigarette vapors  induce  significantly  lower  biological  responses  associated  with  cardiovascular  and  pulmonary  diseases  compared  with  cigarette smoke. Recently, we designed a new consumable for our e-vapor mesh technology to deliver real tobacco taste satisfaction in an E-Vapor product liquid-using patented technology, where flavors and nicotine are extracted directly from the tobacco leaves and captured in a liquid solution, without having to add flavoring ingredients. This consumable has been commercialized in one market in December 2021.\n\nPlatform 5 covers Modern Oral Nicotine Pouches, which consist of white pre-portioned pouches containing nicotine derived from tobacco. Users place a pouch between the upper lip and gum and leave it there while the nicotine and taste are being released. At the end of the use, the user can dispose of the pouch. Nicotine pouches are inherently smoke-free as they are consumed orally, and no combustion process occurs during use. Our nicotine pouches do not contain tobacco. Instead, they contain primarily nicotine, flavors, and a cellulose substrate.  The  nicotine  used  in  the  pouches  is  of  pharmaceutical-grade  like  the  nicotine  used  in  medicinal  products,  such  as  gums  and inhalers, while the flavors are approved for use in food in accordance with the product quality standards for nicotine pouches developed by the  Swedish  Institute  for  Standards.  In  2021,  PMI  acquired AG  Snus  as  well  as  Fertin  Pharma,  two  companies  manufacturing  and/or marketing nicotine pouches.\n\nWe aim to expand our brand portfolio and market positions with additional RRPs. In addition, we are continuing to use our expertise, technology  and  capabilities  to  explore  new  growth  opportunities  beyond  our  current  business,  including  products  that  do  not  contain nicotine or tobacco.\n\nAfter we receive the results of our scientific studies, including those mentioned above, in accordance with standard scientific practices, we share the conclusions in scientific forums and submit them for inclusion in peer-reviewed publications.\n\nThe  research  and  development  expense  for  our  smoke-free  portfolio  accounted  for  99%,  99%  and  98%  of  our  total  research  and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The research and development expense for the years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  is  set  forth  in  Item  8,  Note  14. Additional  Information to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nCommercialization of RRPs: We are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific  market. We  focus  our  commercialization  efforts  on  consumer  retail  experience,  guided  consumer  trials  and  customer  care,  and increasingly,  digital  communication  programs  and  e-commerce.  In order to accelerate switching to our Platform 1 products, our initial market introductions typically entail one-to-one consumer engagement (in person or by digital means) and device discounts.  These initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment, which we believe will moderate over time and further benefit from the increased use of digital engagement capabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated our investments in, and pivot to, digital consumer engagement.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 71 markets in key cities or nationwide.\n\nIn  2014,  we  introduced  our  Platform  1  product  in  pilot  city  launches  in  Nagoya,  Japan,  and  in  Milan,  Italy.  Since  then,  we  have continuously expanded our commercialization activities.\n\nWe believe that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to our Platform 1 product switch back to cigarettes.\n\nWe have integrated the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities, are progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other RRP platforms, and continue to optimize our manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nAn adequate supply chain for our RRP portfolio, including the supply of electronic devices, is important to our business. We work with four electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our Platform 1 and Platform 4 devices, and a small number of other providers for other products in our RRP portfolio and related accessories. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of our two main electronic manufacturing service providers were temporarily suspended at different times. Even though these suspensions did not materially affect our operations, if one or more of these service providers were significantly constrained at the same time, the supply of the devices could be disrupted. Although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health, we cannot guarantee that they will remain capable of meeting their commitments, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; if they will not, the commercialization of our RRPs could be adversely affected. The production of our RRP portfolio requires various metals, and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Note 6.\n\n## Acquisitions:\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAG Snus -  On May 6, 2021, PMI acquired 100% of AG Snus Aktieselskab (\"AG Snus\"), a company based in Denmark, and its Swedish subsidiary Tobacco House of Sweden AB fully owned by AG Snus, which operates in the oral tobacco (i.e. snus) and modern oral (i.e. nicotine pouches) product categories. The purchase price was $28 million in cash, net of cash acquired, with additional contingent payments of up to $10 million, primarily relating to product development and performance targets over a less than two-year period. The operating results of AG Snus are included in the European Union segment, and were not material.\n\nFertin Pharma -  On  September 15, 2021, PMI acquired 100% of Fertin Pharma A/S ('Fertin Pharma'), a company based in Denmark. Fertin Pharma is a developer and manufacturer of pharmaceutical and well-being products based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems. The acquisition was funded with existing cash. The total consideration of $821 million (DKK 5.2 billion) included cash of $580 million and the payment of $241 million related to the settlement of Fertin Pharma's indebtedness. The purchase price of $821 million was preliminarily allocated to cash ($24 million), current assets including receivables and inventories ($69 million), non-current assets including property, plant  and  equipment  ($228  million),  goodwill  ($378  million),  and  other  intangible  assets  ($245  million,  which  primarily  consisted  of customer relationships, developed technology, and in-process research and development (\"IPR&amp;D\")), partially offset by current liabilities ($44  million,  which  primarily  consisted  of  accrued  liabilities  and  accounts  payable)  and  non-current  liabilities  ($79  million,  primarily deferred  income tax).  Goodwill  is  primarily  attributable  to  future  growth  opportunities  provided  by  acquired  R&amp;D  capabilities  and  any intangibles that did not qualify for separate recognition. The amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 8 to 19 years. Subsequent to the acquisition date, PMI made certain measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation, which resulted in an increase to goodwill of $41 million. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in other intangible assets ($82 million), partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities ($21 million), and an increase in property, plant and equipment ($19 million). The purchase price allocation is preliminary and continues to be subject to refinement. PMI is evaluating the deductibility of goodwill for income tax purposes. Fertin Pharma's results of operations from the acquisition date through December 31, 2021 were included in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings, and were not material.\n\nVectura - During the third quarter and up to September 15, 2021, PMI acquired a controlling interest of 74.77% of the total issued shares in Vectura Group plc ('Vectura'), an inhaled therapeutics company based in the United Kingdom. The shares were acquired through a series of open market purchases and acceptances of the tender offer at a price of 165 pence per share. As a result of additional acceptances of the offer and the exercise of the right to acquire compulsorily the Vectura shares, in accordance with the applicable English law, PMI completed the acquisition of 100% of Vectura in the fourth quarter of 2021. The acquisition was funded with existing cash from a designated account operated solely for the purpose of funding this acquisition.",

      "answer": "In 2021, PMI's Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs) generated $9.115 billion in net revenues, a significant increase from $6.827 billion in 2020 and $5.587 billion in 2019, showing a consistent upward trend. In contrast, the combustible product portfolio declined from $24.218 billion in 2019 to $22.190 billion in 2021, indicating a downward trajectory. PMI defines RRPs as products that present less risk of harm to smokers who switch, including heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products. Financially, the company separates RRPs from combustibles and highlights their growth as a strategic pivot toward a 'smoke-free future.' This aligns with PMI\u2019s broader narrative of transitioning away from traditional combustible products and investing in RRPs as a core growth engine, as reflected in both the revenue breakdown and the strategic framing in the financial statement footnotes.",

(also referred to herein as the U.S., the United States or the United States of America), whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and reduced-risk products including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, in markets outside of the United States of America. In addition, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, PMI shipped versions of its Platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to Altria Group, Inc., for sale in the United States under license. For further developments related to the sale of these products in the U.S., see Note 17. Contingencies . Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  smoking.    PMI  has  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.\n\n\"Platform  1\"  is  the  term  PMI  uses  to  refer  to  PMI's  reduced-risk  product  that  uses  a  precisely  controlled  heating  device  into  which  a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant  estimates  and  assumptions  include,  among  other  things:  pension  and  benefit  plan  assumptions;  useful  lives  and valuation  assumptions  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets;  valuation  assumptions  for  non-marketable  equity  securities;  marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises  significant  influence  (generally  20%-50%  ownership  interest)  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting. Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the former Latin America &amp; Canada segment was renamed as the Americas segment. Additionally, due to the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. and OtiTopic, Inc. in the third quarter of 2021, PMI added an Other category. For further details, see Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 12. Segment Reporting .\n\nAs of March 22, 2019, PMI deconsolidated the financial results of its Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\") from PMI's financial statements. For further details, see Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH .\n\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. The changes did not have a material impact on PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.",

On page 97, it is noted that the 'Other' category now encompasses revenues from oral and intra-oral delivery systems resulting from these acquisitions. Page 76 confirms that these acquisitions prompted the addition of the 'Other' category and clarifies that PMI's RRPs include oral nicotine products. Page 5 further contextualizes this by identifying oral nicotine products as part of PMI's RRP portfolio, indicating that while these products are grouped under RRPs, the acquisitions created a distinct reporting category.

          "chunk_text": "## Background and Basis of Presentation:\n\n## Background\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Virginia, U.S.A. (also referred to herein as the U.S., the United States or the United States of America), whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and reduced-risk products including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, in markets outside of the United States of America. In addition, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, PMI shipped versions of its Platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to Altria Group, Inc., for sale in the United States under license. For further developments related to the sale of these products in the U.S., see Note 17. Contingencies . Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  smoking.    PMI  has  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.\n\n\"Platform  1\"  is  the  term  PMI  uses  to  refer  to  PMI's  reduced-risk  product  that  uses  a  precisely  controlled  heating  device  into  which  a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant  estimates  and  assumptions  include,  among  other  things:  pension  and  benefit  plan  assumptions;  useful  lives  and valuation  assumptions  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets;  valuation  assumptions  for  non-marketable  equity  securities;  marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises  significant  influence  (generally  20%-50%  ownership  interest)  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting. Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the former Latin America &amp; Canada segment was renamed as the Americas segment. Additionally, due to the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. and OtiTopic, Inc. in the third quarter of 2021, PMI added an Other category. For further details, see Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 12. Segment Reporting .\n\nAs of March 22, 2019, PMI deconsolidated the financial results of its Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\") from PMI's financial statements. For further details, see Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH .\n\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. The changes did not have a material impact on PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.",

We  are  a  leading  international  tobacco  company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long-term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector.  Our  current  product  portfolio  primarily  consists  of  cigarettes  and  reduced-risk  products,  including  heat-not-burn,  vapor  and  oral nicotine  products,  which  are  sold  in  markets  outside  the  United  States.  Since  2008,  we  have  invested  more  than  $9  billion  to  develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas  of  pre-clinical  systems  toxicology,  clinical  and  behavioral  research,  as  well  as  post-market  studies.  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of a version of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. We describe  the  MRTP  order  in  more  detail  in  the  \"Business  Environment\"  section  of  Item  7. Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life-sciences, in February 2021, we announced our ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet patient and consumer needs.\n\nIn March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  to  smoke. We  have  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development,  scientific  assessment  and  commercialization.  Our  RRPs  are  smoke-free  products  that  contain  and/or  generate  far  lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.  Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our HEETS , HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO ( defined collectively as \" HEETS\") , Marlboro  Dimensions , Marlboro HeatSticks,  Parliament  HeatSticks and TEREA, as  well  as  the  KT&amp;G-licensed  brands, Fiit and Miix (outside of South Korea). Platform 1 was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014. As of December 31, 2021, our smoke-free products are available for sale in 71 markets in key cities or nationwide.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro , the world's best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 38% of our total 2021 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Bond Street, Chesterfield, L&amp;M , Lark and Philip Morris. These seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 79% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2021. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A in Indonesia, and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\nDuring  2021,  we  laid  the  foundation  for  our  long-term  growth  ambitions  beyond  nicotine  in  wellness  and  healthcare,  including  the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S, which provide essential capabilities for future product development.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by\n\n## PART I",

      "answer": "Walmart's strategic investment in PhonePe has evolved significantly over recent fiscal years, reflecting its broader international growth and ambitions in financial services. Initially, Walmart expanded its ownership in PhonePe from approximately 76% to 89% in December 2022 as part of the separation from Flipkart, recording a liability of $0.9 billion to noncontrolling interest holders, which was paid in fiscal 2024. By fiscal 2024, Walmart received $0.7 billion from new equity funding in PhonePe, which diluted its ownership slightly to approximately 84%. This indicates continued confidence in PhonePe's growth potential and its role in Walmart's international financial services ecosystem. In the Walmart International segment, PhonePe is highlighted as a key platform offering mobile and bill payments, P2P transfers, investment and insurance solutions, and advertising services, aligning with Walmart\u2019s broader omni-channel and financial services strategy in India and globally.",

(\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to helping people around the world save money and live better by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 270 million customers who visit more than 10,750 stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 19 countries.\n\nOur strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.\n\nOur operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of, and for the fiscal years ended, January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"). During fiscal 2025, we generated total revenues of $681.0 billion, which primarily comprised net sales of $674.5 billion.\n\nWe maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\"\n\n## The Development of Our Company\n\nThe businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores, at which time we began to open discount stores. We completed our initial public offering in 1970. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2025, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 18 countries.\n\nIn 1996, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site-to-Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and delivery locations globally. In 2018, we expanded our eCommerce and digital presence through acquisitions with our majority stakes in Flipkart and PhonePe in India. We continue to heavily invest in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, which enables us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, and expand our assortment and service offerings.\n\nWe are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities through a combination of stores, eCommerce websites and service offerings, as well as our supply chain, combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2025, to better serve our customers. Together, these elements produce a global retail ecosystem that we believe allows customers to view Walmart as their primary retail destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy globally, our business is expanding through offerings such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, and financial services. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our omni-channel model centered on our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.\n\n## Information About Our Segments\n\nWe are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S., which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Shareholders' E quity\n\nThe total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 33.0 billion, of which 8.0 billion and 8.1 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value preferred stock is 0.1 billion; none of which were issued or outstanding for any period presented.\n\n## Purchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. The Company's ownership of Flipkart increased from approximately 75% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 85% as of January 31, 2024.\n\nAlso during fiscal 2024, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority owned PhonePe subsidiary, which decreased the Company's ownership from approximately 89% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 84% as of January 31, 2024.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%. Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner. This entity was subsequently sold and deconsolidated in fiscal 2025.\n\nAlso during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe from approximately 76% to approximately 89% as part of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. In consideration for the transaction, the Company initially recorded a liability to noncontrolling interest holders of $0.9 billion within accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023, which was paid during fiscal 2024.\n\n## Share-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $2.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation ex pense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $0.7 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

          "chunk_text": "## Walmart International Segment\n\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operates 5,566 stores across 18 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).\n\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, warehouse clubs (including our membership-only Sam's Club format) and cash and carry, as well as eCommerce through websites and mobile applications, including walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, PhonePe and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $121.9 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 18% of our fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $114.6 billion and $101.0 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWalmart International's strategy is to bring Walmart to the world and the world to Walmart, which means we help millions of customers and members save money and live better every day by leveraging our global ecosystem and deep local expertise to provide access to affordable products and services. In addition, we share what we learn in our markets to help the enterprise innovate and grow even faster. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to reshape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n- Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital payments platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in December 2022.\n- Sold our equity investment in JD.com in August 2024.\n\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides a convenient and seamless omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through our pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, including same-day delivery. We continue to expand our marketplace offerings, which also further unlocks fulfillment and advertising services.\n\nGenerally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2025, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and delivery locations.\n\nMerchandise and Other Offerings. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera\" and \"Lider.\" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.\n\nConsistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, financial services and healthcare. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service enhancing customer experiences through digital connectivity.\n\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 184 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mex ico and Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers, which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live.",

However, this investment faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny in India, particularly from the Directorate of Enforcement, which issued a show cause notice in July 2021 related to alleged violations of Foreign Direct Investment rules during 2009\u20132015\u2014prior to Walmart\u2019s acquisition of a majority stake. The matter remains unresolved, with potential consequences including monetary penalties or share ownership restrictions.

(\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to helping people around the world save money and live better by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 270 million customers who visit more than 10,750 stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 19 countries.\n\nOur strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.\n\nOur operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of, and for the fiscal years ended, January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"). During fiscal 2025, we generated total revenues of $681.0 billion, which primarily comprised net sales of $674.5 billion.\n\nWe maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\"\n\n## The Development of Our Company\n\nThe businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores, at which time we began to open discount stores. We completed our initial public offering in 1970. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2025, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 18 countries.\n\nIn 1996, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site-to-Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and delivery locations globally. In 2018, we expanded our eCommerce and digital presence through acquisitions with our majority stakes in Flipkart and PhonePe in India. We continue to heavily invest in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, which enables us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, and expand our assortment and service offerings.\n\nWe are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities through a combination of stores, eCommerce websites and service offerings, as well as our supply chain, combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2025, to better serve our customers. Together, these elements produce a global retail ecosystem that we believe allows customers to view Walmart as their primary retail destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy globally, our business is expanding through offerings such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, and financial services. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our omni-channel model centered on our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.\n\n## Information About Our Segments\n\nWe are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S., which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.",

On December 23, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") filed a lawsuit against the Company and Branch Messenger, Inc. in the District of Minnesota alleging the Company violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by allegedly requiring independent contractor drivers on the Spark platform to receive payments through a financial product offered by Branch. The CFPB seeks an injunction and unspecified restitution, damages, and civil penalties. On February 20, 2025, the Court entered an order that indefinitely stays the case and vacates all deadlines.\n\nThe Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from other governmental entities regarding the independent contractor classification of drivers and payment and operational practices with respect to the driver platform. The Company is also defending putative class and representative action civil litigation relating to driver classification and defending other civil litigation and arbitration claims in connection with the driver platform.\n\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend these matters.

On October 6, 2023, the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Competencia Econ\u00f3mica of M\u00e9xico (\"COFECE\") notified the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de M\u00e9xico, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, that COFECE's Investigatory Authority (\"IA\") had recommended the initiation of a quasi-judicial administrative process against Walmex's subsidiary for alleged relative monopolistic practices in connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods, retail marketing practices of such consumer goods and related services. On December 12, 2024, after Walmex provided defenses, produced expert evidence and participated in a hearing, COFECE issued a split decision that Walmex's subsidiary had engaged in a single relative monopolistic practice in relation to the negotiation of two types of contributions with its suppliers. The resolution imposed a monetary penalty on Walmex's subsidiary in the amount of $93.4 million pesos (approximately $5 million U.S. dollars) and certain non-structural conduct measures relating to the two prohibited types of supplier contributions (while recognizing that other supplier contributions can continue). On January 6, 2025, Walmex's subsidiary challenged COFECE's resolution through an appeal in the specialized federal courts. Until the appeal is resolved, Walmex's subsidiary will operate in compliance with COFECE's ruling. Payment of the monetary penalty is stayed until the lawsuit is resolved.\n\nForeign Direct Investment Matters. In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (\"Flipkart\"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the \"Rules\") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018 (the \"Notice\"), in addition to more recent requests for information from the Directorate of Enforcement to Flipkart for periods prior and subsequent to April 2016 regarding the Rules, including the most recent request in February 2025 (the \"Requests\"). The Notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the Notice. If a hearing is initiated, whether with respect to the Notice or from further proceedings related to the Requests, and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, then the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief, such as share ownership restrictions. Flipkart has been responding to the Notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the Notice, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that the process regarding the Notice is in the early stages, the Company is unable to predict whether the Notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings, as well as whether any further proceedings will arise with respect to the Requests. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters and can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the Notice or the Requests, or the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement for the period prior to the date the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and further can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.",

These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, warehouse clubs (including our membership-only Sam's Club format) and cash and carry, as well as eCommerce through websites and mobile applications, including walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, PhonePe and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $121.9 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 18% of our fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $114.6 billion and $101.0 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWalmart International's strategy is to bring Walmart to the world and the world to Walmart, which means we help millions of customers and members save money and live better every day by leveraging our global ecosystem and deep local expertise to provide access to affordable products and services. In addition, we share what we learn in our markets to help the enterprise innovate and grow even faster. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to reshape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n- Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital payments platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in December 2022.\n- Sold our equity investment in JD.com in August 2024.\n\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides a convenient and seamless omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through our pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, including same-day delivery. We continue to expand our marketplace offerings, which also further unlocks fulfillment and advertising services.\n\nGenerally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2025, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and delivery locations.\n\nMerchandise and Other Offerings. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera\" and \"Lider.\" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.\n\nConsistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, financial services and healthcare. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service enhancing customer experiences through digital connectivity.\n\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 184 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mex ico and Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers, which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live.",

At September 1, 2024, Costco operated  890 warehouses worldwide: 614 in the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 108 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 35 in Japan, 29 in the U.K., 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in T aiwan, sev en in China, four in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Z ealand, and Sweden. T he Company operates ecommerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its subsidiaries. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company's equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries hav e been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.\n\n## Fiscal Year End\n\nThe Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 1, 2024 and August 28, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rev enues and expenses during the reporting period. T hese estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Reclassification\n\nReclassifications were made to the 2023 and 2022 consolidated statements of cash flows to conform with current year presentation.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid inv estments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receiv ables were $2,519 and $2,282 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Short-Term Investments\n\nShort-term inv estments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. gov ernment and agency securities), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to fiv e years.

In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified because they contain words  such  as  'anticipate,'  'believ e,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'estimate,'  'expect,'  'intend,'  'likely,'  'may,'  'might,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'predict,'  'project,' 'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  similar  expressions  and  the  negativ es  of  those  terms.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1-Business\n\nCostco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle,  Washington.  We  are  principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Australia,  T aiwan,  China,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  New  Z ealand,  and  Sweden.  Costco  operated  890,  861,  and  838  warehouses  worldwide  at September 1, 2024, September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (fiv e weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). T he material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended September 1, 2024, and August 28, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate  membership  warehouses  and  e-commerce  sites  based  on  the  concept  that  offering  our  members  low  prices  on  a  limited  selection  of nationally-branded and priv ate-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales v olumes and rapid inv entory turnov er. When combined with  the  operating  efficiencies  achiev ed  by  v olume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-serv ice warehouse facilities, these v olumes and turnov er enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inv entory before we are required to pay for it, ev en while taking adv antage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots  receiv e  large  shipments  from  suppliers  and  quickly  ship  these  goods  to  warehouses.  T his  process  creates  freight  v olume  and  handling efficiencies,  lowering  costs  associated  with  traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  Our  e-commerce  operations  ship  merchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other deliv ery arrangements with our suppliers.",

      "answer": "Costco uses forward foreign-exchange contracts to hedge inventory expenditures made by international subsidiaries in non-functional currencies, as stated in the Derivatives section. In 2024, Costco had a net liability position of $28 million in these contracts compared to a liability of $7 million in 2023, indicating an increased exposure.

We  are  principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Australia,  T aiwan,  China,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  New  Z ealand,  and  Sweden.  Costco  operated  890,  861,  and  838  warehouses  worldwide  at September 1, 2024, September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (fiv e weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year).

When combined with  the  operating  efficiencies  achiev ed  by  v olume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-serv ice warehouse facilities, these v olumes and turnov er enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers.

      "question": "How does Costco's limited presence in New Zealand compare to its investments in other international markets, and what does this suggest about its geographic prioritization?",
      "answer": "Costco operates only one warehouse in New Zealand, as noted in the description of business on page_42, where it lists New Zealand among locations with just a single warehouse. In comparison, other international markets like Australia and the U.K. have significantly more warehouses\u201415 in Australia and 29 in the U.K.\u2014indicating a much larger investment in these markets. Furthermore, according to the segment reporting on page_63, New Zealand is grouped within Costco's broader international operations but is not highlighted as a distinct or prioritized market. This minimal presence, combined with the lack of emphasis in the forward-looking statements on page_4, suggests that New Zealand is not a key focus in Costco's geographic expansion strategy, especially when compared to markets with higher warehouse counts and more explicit strategic attention.",

The captive participates in a reinsurance program with third-party participants, designed to limit individual risk exposure.

      "answer": "Costco utilizes forward foreign-exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with currency fluctuations on international inventory purchases, particularly U.S. dollar-denominated expenditures by subsidiaries with non-functional currencies. As of 2024, the aggregate notional value of these contracts was $1,212, indicating the scale of their international exposure. The contracts had a liability position of $28 as of 2024 on the balance sheet, showing the financial impact of currency movements. Additionally, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of functional currencies relative to non-functional currencies would have decreased the fair value of these contracts by $120, aligning with their stated objective of economically hedging known future expenditures without speculative intent.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo strategically divested its Tropicana, Naked, and other select juice brands in North America and Europe for $3.5 billion in cash and a 39% noncontrolling interest in a joint venture, expecting a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 billion in the PBNA and Europe segments. However, in the Europe segment, the company also discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia, resulting in a pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022. This reflects a broader strategic realignment where juice brands are partially exited in some markets (e.g., Russia) while partially retained through a joint venture in others (e.g., North America and Europe), indicating a nuanced approach to brand portfolio optimization across different geographies.",

In  connection  with  the  sale,  we  entered  into  a transition  services  agreement  with  PAI  Partners,  under  which  we  will  provide  certain  services  to  the  joint venture to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, the new joint venture is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our actual costs without markup. Subsequent to the transaction close date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. We expect to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 billion in our PBNA and Europe segments in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of this transaction.\n\nWe have reclassified $1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $0.5 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of",

Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.\n\n## Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. We did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinitelived intangible assets in the year ended December 25, 2021. In 2020, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge  of  $41  million  related  to  a  coconut  water  brand  in  PBNA.  We  did  not  recognize  any  material impairment  charges  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  year  ended  December  28,  2019.  As  of December 25, 2021, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value  of  PBNA's  reacquired  and  acquired  franchise  rights  if  future  revenues  and  their  contribution  to  the operating results of PBNA's  CSD  business  do  not  achieve  our  expected  future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.\n\nWe have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there are no impairments for the year ended  December  25,  2021.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  is  dependent  on macroeconomic  conditions  (including  a  resulting  increase  in  the  weighted-average  cost  of  capital  used  to estimate  fair  value),  future  revenues  and  their  contributions  to  operating  results  and  expected  future  cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions), and significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe segment. As a result, we will recognize pre-tax impairment charges of approximately $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nFor further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.",

      "question": "How does PepsiCo's positioning of SodaStream as a sustainability-driven business model align with its global beverage expansion strategy and pep+ sustainability goals related to packaging reduction and environmental impact?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo positions SodaStream as a key component of its sustainability-driven business model by highlighting its role in reducing single-use plastic packaging, with the brand already being the largest sparkling water brand in the world by volume and operating in more than 40 countries (page_34). The company's global beverage expansion strategy includes SodaStream's new Professional platform, which aims to enter additional markets and expand into functional beverages by the end of 2022 (page_34). This aligns with PepsiCo\u2019s pep+ sustainability goals, specifically under the 'Positive Value Chain' pillar, which emphasizes cutting virgin plastic per serving, increasing recycled content in plastic packaging, and scaling SodaStream globally as a platform that 'almost entirely eliminates the need for beverage packaging' (page_33). Furthermore, SodaStream is embedded in PepsiCo\u2019s broader strategic transformation under pep+, which seeks to operate within planetary boundaries and reduce environmental impact across the value chain, including through net-zero emissions and water-positive targets (page_33). The integration of SodaStream into PepsiCo\u2019s long-term vision reflects a coordinated effort to align product innovation with sustainability and global market expansion.",

These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, which may continue to result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes  to  our  supply  chain  or  increases  in  employee  costs,  including  expanded  benefits  and  frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through labor shortages, raw",

Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute  and  sell  a  wide  variety  of  beverages  and  convenient  foods,  serving  customers  and  consumers  in more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nAs a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2021 as our consumers, customers,  and  competitors  across  the  world,  including  the  second  year  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic;  a worsening climate crisis; supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors;  a  highly  competitive  operating  environment;  a  rapidly  changing  retail  landscape,  including  the growth  in  e-commerce;  continued  macroeconomic  and  political  volatility;  and  an  evolving  regulatory landscape.\n\nTo meet the challenges of today - and those of tomorrow - we are driven by an approach called PepsiCo Positive (pep+). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of  how  the  company  will  strive  to  create  growth  and  value  by  operating  within  planetary  boundaries  and inspiring  positive  change  for  the  planet  and  people.  pep+  will  guide  how  we  will  work  to  transform  our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.\n\npep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework:\n\n- Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the Earth across land equal  to  the  company's  entire  agricultural  footprint  (approximately  7  million  acres),  sustainably source  key  crops  and  ingredients,  and  improve  the  livelihoods  of  more  people  in  our  agricultural supply chain.\n- Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to:  achieve  net-zero  emissions  by  2040;  become  net  water  positive  by  2030;  and  introduce  more sustainable  packaging  into  the  value  chain.  Our  packaging  goals  include  cutting  virgin  plastic  per serving,  using  recycled  content  in  our  plastic  packaging,  and  scaling  our  SodaStream  business globally,  an  innovative  platform  that  almost  entirely  eliminates  the  need  for  beverage  packaging, among  other  levers.

      "answer": "The Gillette brand, as a core component of P&G's Grooming segment, accounted for 8% of net sales and 9% of earnings in the reportable segments. However, during fiscal 2024, the company recorded a $1.3 billion before-tax ($1.0 billion after-tax) non-cash impairment charge on the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, primarily due to a higher discount rate, currency depreciation, and the impact of restructuring in certain markets. This impairment was further emphasized in the summary of 2024 results as a non-core item excluded from sustainable earnings and management compensation evaluation, indicating a strategic distancing from the historical valuation of the brand amid financial pressures.",

      "question": "How are PG's operational challenges in specific segments like Fabric Care and Skin & Personal Care in Greater China interacting with broader macroeconomic risks, and how has this affected their financial performance?",
      "answer": "PG's Fabric Care segment experienced a mid-teens sales decline in Greater China due to market contraction and portfolio rationalization, while the Skin & Personal Care segment saw a decline in unit volume driven by the contraction of the super-premium SK-II brand and broader market challenges. These segment-specific issues were compounded by macroeconomic risks in Greater China, a key international market accounting for a significant portion of PG's global sales. The region's economic and market instability contributed to a 7% drop in net earnings for the Skin & Personal Care segment and a 170 basis-point decline in its net earnings margin. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and market-specific dynamics like increased pricing sensitivity further pressured profitability. Together, these operational and macroeconomic factors created a challenging environment that significantly impacted PG's financial results in Greater China.",

This restructuring program, focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets like Argentina and Nigeria, incurred $659 million in fiscal 2024 restructuring costs, including significant non-cash foreign currency translation losses. The impairment also highlights broader macroeconomic risks, as the company notes that adverse changes in global inflation, currency exchange rates, and economic recession could further reduce cash flows and trigger additional impairments.

These PSUs are a key component of the company's executive compensation structure, specifically targeted at senior-level executives as part of an additional long-term incentive program described on page 53. In this program, PSUs are paid in shares after a three-year performance period, subject to pre-established performance goals and a Relative Total Shareholder Return (R-TSR) modifier. The valuation methodology for these PSUs, outlined on page 54, involves a Monte-Carlo simulation model with assumptions similar to those used for stock options, ensuring consistent and rigorous fair value estimation for financial reporting purposes.",

      "question": "How does the financial and strategic impact of Altria's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements reconcile with its litigation exposure and long-term valuation assumptions, particularly in light of inflation-linked payment increases, ongoing health care cost recovery lawsuits, and impairment risk on intangible assets?",
      "answer": "Altria's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements include annual payments adjusted for inflation (e.g., 3.4% in 2023), which are not expected to materially impact financial position despite rising inflation. These payments, totaling $3.7 billion in 2023, are recorded in cost of sales and are subject to adjustments based on market share and industry volume. However, Altria also faces ongoing litigation risks, including health care cost recovery lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada, where it is a defendant in multiple class actions and government claims. While most U.S. cases have been dismissed, the Canadian proceedings remain stayed but pose potential future liabilities. Simultaneously, Altria\u2019s long-term valuation models for intangible assets assume perpetual growth rates of 1\u20132% and a 10.7% discount rate, which are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, litigation outcomes, and regulatory changes. The interplay of these factors\u2014settlement obligations, litigation exposure, and impairment risk\u2014creates a complex financial landscape that could materially affect future earnings and asset valuations.",

      "question": "How did the decline in Altria's equity method investment income from ABI between 2021 ($5.56 billion) and 2023 ($-539 million) relate to the company's tax treatment of this investment and their foreign exchange risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "Altria's equity method investment income from ABI showed a significant decline from $5.56 billion in 2021 to a loss of $539 million in 2023. This downward trend was reflected in the tax treatment, as the company recorded a $32 million tax expense in 2023 related to a tax basis adjustment from the ABI investment, contrasting with the $729 million tax benefit in 2022 from valuation allowance releases on other investments like JUUL. Additionally, Altria managed foreign exchange risk stemming from its ABI investment\u2014denominated in Euros\u2014by using designated foreign currency contracts and Euro-denominated debt as net investment hedges, despite having no outstanding contracts at the end of 2023. The combination of declining investment returns, tax implications, and currency risk mitigation strategies reveals a complex interplay of financial performance, tax planning, and risk management around the ABI investment.",

      "answer": "Altria transferred its JUUL equity securities in March 2023, recognizing a $250 million non-cash, pre-tax loss on disposition, reflecting a strategic pivot away from JUUL amid declining fair value assessments. This follows a $1.455 billion unrealized loss in 2022 due to regulatory setbacks, liquidity concerns, and revised revenue projections for JUUL. In exchange, Altria received a non-exclusive global license to JUUL's heated tobacco IP, aligning with its broader 'Moving Beyond Smoking' initiative and supporting its transition toward potentially less harmful tobacco alternatives, including through its joint venture Horizon Innovations and acquisition of NJOY.",

      "question": "How does Target's strategic emphasis on expanding owned brands align with the risks and operational challenges associated with these brands, particularly given their significant contribution to sales and the company's reliance on longer-term forecasting and supply chain coordination?",
      "answer": "Target's strategy emphasizes expanding owned brands as a key driver for growth and differentiation, noting that these brands represent approximately one-third of overall sales and carry higher margins than national brands. However, the company faces significant operational challenges, including longer lead times, increased forecasting complexity, and greater supply chain disruption risks due to the nature of owned brand development and sourcing. These risks are compounded by the need for responsible sourcing and intellectual property protection, which could adversely affect results if not managed effectively. Therefore, while owned brands are central to Target's growth strategy, their success depends on successfully navigating these forecasting and supply chain challenges.",

      "answer": "Target's relationship with CVS Pharmacy, Inc. is multifaceted and reflects both structural and revenue-generating dimensions. Structurally, Target leases space to CVS within its stores, as noted in the leases section, where it is stated that the lease and sublease portfolio mainly consists of operating leases with CVS. Operationally, the partnership is governed by a Pharmacy Operating Agreement dated December 16, 2015, with multiple amendments, indicating a long-standing and evolving collaboration. From a revenue perspective, CVS operates pharmacies and clinics in Target stores under a perpetual operating agreement, from which Target generates annual occupancy income. This synthesis shows that the partnership is not only a physical and contractual arrangement but also a consistent source of income for Target.",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's treatment of mutual, pooled and commingled funds differ across short-term and long-term asset disclosures, particularly in terms of valuation categorization and investment allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's treatment of mutual, pooled and commingled funds shows distinct differences in valuation categorization and investment allocation between short-term and long-term asset disclosures. In the short-term asset disclosure, mutual, pooled and commingled funds are valued at $87 million as of December 31, 2021, with $85 million categorized under Level 2 and $2 million under Other. This suggests a primarily observable market-based valuation approach with limited unobservable inputs. In contrast, the long-term asset disclosure shows a significantly larger allocation of $850 million for these funds, with $36 million in Level 1, $283 million in Level 2, and $531 million classified under Other. This indicates a more complex valuation methodology involving significant unobservable inputs and potentially less liquid investments. The difference in allocation ($87 million vs. $850 million) also reflects Coca-Cola's distinct investment strategies for short-term versus long-term assets, with the latter involving substantially more exposure to pooled investment vehicles.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's allocation to corporate bonds and debt securities is significantly larger in its primary financial assets ($1,023 million as of December 31, 2021 in Level 2 classification) compared to its other postretirement benefit plan assets ($82 million as of December 31, 2021). The primary financial assets also include a Level 3 classification of $29 million, indicating some complexity and potential illiquidity, while the postretirement assets are entirely Level 2, suggesting more standardized and liquid instruments. This disparity in scale and classification implies a differentiated risk profile and strategic intent between the two portfolios, with the primary portfolio assuming more risk for potential return, while the postretirement assets emphasize stability and liquidity.",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's decision not to impair its $87 million write-down of the CCBJHI investment align with its broader equity securities position and operational stakes in bottling companies, particularly in light of its reported investment values and geographic asset concentrations?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola determined that the $87 million decline in value of its CCBJHI investment was temporary, citing its intent and ability to hold the investment long enough for recovery, and therefore did not record an impairment charge. This aligns with the company's broader equity securities position, where investments in U.S.-based and international companies totaled $184 million and $12 million respectively as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, the company holds significant operational stakes in bottling companies, including geographic concentrations such as South Africa and the Philippines, where property, plant, and equipment represented 15-16% and 10% of the consolidated total, respectively. These stakes suggest a strategic long-term approach to bottling investments, supporting the decision to forgo impairment on the CCBJHI investment despite its current undervaluation.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola initially intended to refranchise CCBA and classified it as held for sale from late 2017 through early 2019, during which time depreciation and amortization were suspended. When the company updated its plans in Q2 2019 to maintain control of CCBA, it was no longer considered held for sale, requiring a $160 million adjustment to reflect previously unrecognized depreciation and amortization on CCBA's assets. This adjustment was recorded in 2019 but impacted financial statements referenced through 2021. Additionally, the amortization expense for intangible assets increased in 2020 compared to 2019 because the full year\u2019s amortization for CCBA was recognized in 2020 versus only seven months in 2019. By 2021, the amortization expense had decreased to $165 million, suggesting a maturing intangible asset base or changes in the valuation assumptions for CCBA. Together, these elements show how strategic shifts in CCBA\u2019s ownership structure directly influenced both income statement volatility and long-term amortization trends.",

The fair value of our previously held equity investment was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs. The net loss was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDuring 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited ('CCA'), an equity method investee, to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), also an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $1,738 million and recognized a net gain of $695 million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative translation adjustments. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $293 million and recognized a net gain of $114 million as a result of these sales.\n\nDuring 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $100 million and recognized a net loss of $2 million as a result of this sale. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $62 million and recognized a net gain of $35 million as a result of these sales.\n\nDuring 2019, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $429 million, which primarily related to the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Embotelladora Andina S.A. ('Andina') and the refranchising of certain of our bottling operations in India. As a result of these transactions, we recognized gains of $39 million and $73 million, respectively. We continue to account for our remaining ownership interest in Andina as an equity method investment as a result of our representation on Andina's Board of Directors and other governance rights.\n\n## Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited\n\nDue to the Company's original intent to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited ('CCBA'), it was accounted for as held for sale and as a discontinued operation from October 2017 through the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, CCBA's property, plant and equipment was not depreciated and its definite-lived intangible assets were not amortized during this period. While the Company had discussions with a number of potential partners throughout the period CCBA was held for sale, during the second quarter of 2019 the Company updated its plans with the intent to maintain its controlling stake in CCBA, which resulted in CCBA no longer qualifying as held for sale or as a discontinued operation. As a result of this change, we recorded a $160 million adjustment to reduce the carrying value of CCBA's property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets by an additional $34 million and $126 million, respectively, to reflect additional depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized during the period CCBA was held for sale. This adjustment was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had certain bottling operations in Asia Pacific that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, we were required to record their assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. As the fair value less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, the related assets and liabilities were recorded at their carrying value. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. The Company expects these bottling operations to be refranchised during 2022.",

      "answer": "PM has invested $12.5 billion since 2008 in the development and commercialization of Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs), reflecting a core strategic shift toward a smoke-free future. However, this investment faces dual challenges: financial market exposure and regulatory uncertainty. The value-at-risk computation on page 81 shows increased volatility in foreign currency and interest rate exposures, which could affect the financial returns from RRPs. Meanwhile, page 12 outlines significant regulatory risks, including potential restrictions from WHO recommendations and FCTC policy decisions, which could limit the availability and marketing of RRPs.

      "answer": "The termination of the distribution arrangement in the Middle East resulted in a $80 million pre-tax charge, which was recorded as a reduction of net revenues in the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment. Despite this charge, the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment reported $9,321 million in combustible tobacco product revenues for 2023, showing a slight increase from $9,173 million in 2022. This financial impact and revenue trend occurred in the context of PMI's broader strategic reorganization in January 2023, where the company consolidated its operations into four geographic segments, including SSEA, CIS & MEA, to support smoke-free business growth and increase innovation speed. The segment's performance reflects both the headwinds from the distribution charge and the ongoing strategic focus on regional integration and smoke-free product development.",

      "answer": "PM reported that 9 of its 50 global manufacturing facilities produced Heated Tobacco Units (HTUs), with integration into existing infrastructure as part of capacity expansion plans. The shipment volumes and market share performance referenced in the document include both cigarettes and HTUs, excluding China and duty-free business unless otherwise stated. Additionally, market share calculations specifically define HTU in-market sales volume as a percentage of total industry HTU sales, excluding China and the U.S. This alignment shows that PM's production infrastructure supports its shipment definitions and directly feeds into how it measures and reports market performance for HTUs.",

      "answer": "Target's partnership with CVS Pharmacy, Inc. contributes to its revenue through annual occupancy income generated by hosting CVS-operated pharmacies and clinics in its stores. The real estate strategy includes subleasing space within Target stores to CVS under operating leases, forming a significant portion of Target's sublease portfolio. This partnership is governed by a long-term Pharmacy Operating Agreement, originally signed in 2015, with multiple amendments through 2018, indicating a sustained contractual relationship that shapes both companies' operational and financial planning.",

      "answer": "Target's Starbucks partnership contributes to in-store traffic and enhances the guest experience, aligning with the company's broader strategy to offer a range of amenities, including 'in-store amenities such as Starbucks, Target Caf\u00e9, and Target Optical' (page_6). However, the company explicitly notes that any 'termination of, or adverse change in, our relationship with any of these companies [including Starbucks] could decrease our sales, increase our costs, and negatively impact our reputation and results of operations' (page_15). Furthermore, Target acknowledges that reputational harm can occur indirectly through companies with whom it partners, such as Starbucks, and that negative consumer experiences or perceptions of these partners could lead to reduced customer traffic and adversely affect financial performance (page_12). Therefore, while Starbucks contributes to store traffic and enhances the omnichannel experience, the partnership also introduces measurable risk exposure in terms of both financial performance and brand reputation, particularly if operational or reputational issues arise with the partner.",

If our replenishment and fulfillment network does not operate properly, if we are unable to timely import certain merchandise, if a v endor fails to deliv er on its commitments, or if common carriers hav e difficulty prov iding capacity to meet demands for their serv ices like they experienced in recent years, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks, delays in shipping and receiv ing merchandise, and increased costs, which could adv ersely affect our reputation and results of operations. In addition, we hav e consumer-facing relationships with a v ariety of other companies, including Apple, CVS, Disney, Lev i's, Starbucks, and Ulta Beauty. Any termination of, or adv erse change in, our relationship with any of these companies could decrease our sales, increase our costs, and negativ ely impact our reputation and results of operations.\n\nA significant portion of the merchandise that we offer is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the U.S., with China as our single largest source of merchandise we import. Any trade disputes or changes in tax or trade policy between the U.S. and countries from which we source merchandise, such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could require us to take certain actions, including raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternativ e  sources  of  supply  from  v endors  in  other  countries.  In  particular ,  recent  U.S.  tariffs  imposed  or  threatened  to  be  imposed  on  China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries could result in us incurring substantial additional costs to procure a large portion of the merchandise we offer and may require us to raise prices on certain products. In addition, if our competitors do not keep pace with any such price increases or are able to offset the impact of tariffs through other actions, our competitiv e position may be adv ersely affected. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nPolitical or economic uncertainty or instability, trade policies, disputes, or sanctions, currency fluctuations, the outbreak of pandemics or other illnesses, labor shortages, labor unrest or strikes, transport capacity and costs, inflation, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, social unrest, terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, or other ev ents that hav e affected, and could in the future affect, foreign trade are beyond our control. T hese types of ev ents hav e impacted us, and could impact us in the future, including by disrupting our supply of merchandise, increasing the price and limiting the availability of raw materials, increasing our costs, and adv ersely affecting our results of operations. For example, there hav e been periodic closings and ship div ersions, armed conflicts, unrest, labor disputes, and congestion disrupting railways, trucking, waterways, and ports around the world, including at major U.S. ports where we receiv e a significant portion of the products we source from outside the U.S. We hav e from time to time made alternativ e arrangements to continue the flow of inv entory as a result of supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries. If these types of ev ents recur and impact any of the locations or modes of transportation that we depend on, it could increase our costs and adv ersely affect our supply of inv entory. In addition, prices of fuel and  other  commodities  on  which  our  supply  chain  depends  are  historically  v olatile  and  subject  to  fluctuations  based  on  a  v ariety  of  international  and domestic factors. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices, as hav e occurred in recent years, could further increase our costs and adv ersely affect our results of operations.\n\nIf s ervices  we obtain from third parties are unavailable, fail to meet our standards, or increase in cost, our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe  rely  on  third  parties  to  support  our  business  operations,  including  portions  of  our  technology  infrastructure,  digital  platforms,  replenishment  and fulfillment operations, store and supply chain infrastructure, deliv ery serv ices (including by independent contractors v ia our Shipt subsidiary), guest contact centers, payment processing, and extensions of credit for our T arget-branded payment card program. If we are unable to contract with third parties hav ing the specialized skills needed to support our operations (including as a result of any labor disputes or labor unav ailability at such third parties), if any thirdparty serv ices are interrupted, or if they fail to meet our performance standards, then our reputation and results of operations could be adv ersely affected.",

We hav e consumerfacing relationships with a v ariety of other companies, including Apple, CVS, Disney, Lev i's, Starbucks, and Ulta Beauty. In addition, we hav e relationships with third-party companies that sell and ship items directly to guests through our digital channels. We also hav e relationships with designers, celebrities, influencers,  and  other  indiv iduals,  including  for  adv ertising  campaigns  and  marketing  programs.  If  consumers  hav e  negativ e  experiences  with,  or  v iew unfav orably, any of the companies or indiv iduals with whom we hav e relationships, it could cause them to not shop with us and negativ ely impact our results of operations.\n\n## If  we are unable to successfully develop, source, and market our owned and exclusive brand products, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur  owned  and  exclusiv e  brand  products  represent  approximately  one  third  of  our  ov erall  merchandise  sales  and  generally  carry  higher  margins  than equiv alent national brand products.  Our ability to source, dev elop, and market our owned and exclusiv e brands depends on many factors, including our ability  to  anticipate  consumer  demand  and  preferences  and  make  trend-right  decisions,  our  relationships  with  v endors,  the  av ailability  and  price  of  raw materials, product quality, and our ability to offer products at affordable prices. If we are unable to successfully dev elop, source, and market our owned and exclusiv e brands, or if we are unable to successfully protect our related intellectual property rights, our results of operations could be adv ersely affected. In addition, our reliance on owned and exclusiv e brand products may also amplify other risks discussed in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, because many of these products are imported and we are more inv olv ed in the dev elopment and sourcing of those products. For example, any failure of our owned brands to meet applicable safety standards or T arget's or our guests' expectations regarding safety, quality, supply chain transparency, and responsible sourcing could expose us to government enforcement actions and priv ate litigation, result in costly product recalls and other liabilities, and exacerbate our reputational risks. In addition, owned brand products generally need longer lead times between order placement and product deliv ery and require us to take ownership of those  products  earlier  in  the  supply  chain.  T his  requires  accurate  longer-term  forecasting  of  consumer  demand  to  effectiv ely  manage  our  operations, including  for  categories  where  consumer  preferences  may  change  rapidly,  and  exposes  us  to  enhanced  risks  of  supply  chain  disruptions.  We  hav e prev iously been, and may in the future be, unable to accurately predict consumer demand for our owned brand products. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in insufficient or excess inv entory, increased inv entory markdowns, and higher costs. Any of these outcomes could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## If we are unable to protect against inventory shrink, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nOur business depends on our ability to effectiv ely manage our inv entory.  We hav e historically experienced loss of inv entory (also called shrink) due to damage, theft (including from organized retail crime), and other causes. In recent years, we hav e experienced elev ated lev els of inv entory shrink relativ e to historical lev els, which hav e adv ersely affected, and could continue to adv ersely affect, our results of operations and financial condition. T o protect against rising inv entory shrink, we hav e taken, and may continue to take, certain operational and strategic actions that could adv ersely affect our reputation, guest experience,  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  sustained  high  rates  of  inv entory  shrink  at  certain  stores  hav e  contributed,  and  may  continue  to contribute, to the closure of certain stores and the impairment of long-term assets.\n\n## We depend on seasonal moments and higher-margin merchandise to drive sales and net earnings growth.\n\nOur business experiences some seasonality, with a larger portion of our sales traditionally occurring in the fourth quarter because it includes the Nov ember and December holiday sales period. In addition to the Nov ember and December holiday sales period, we also see increased sales activ ity during the backto-school and back-to-college period and other seasonal moments throughout the year. As a result, any factors negativ ely impacting us during any of these periods,  including  weather  conditions,  natural  disasters,  macroeconomic  conditions,  consumer  preferences,  and  political  or  economic  uncertainty  or instability, could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe offer our guests a multi-category assortment of ev eryday essentials and differentiated merchandise. Howev er, we depend on sales of our higher-margin merchandise to driv e net earnings growth. As a result, flat sales and sales declines of our higher-margin merchandise hav e prev iously limited, and may in the future limit, our ability to driv e net earnings growth. Furthermore, we are subject to cyclical trends in consumer spending, which may\n\n2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the divergence in Cheese & Grocery category performance between North America (volume gain in 2024) and Latin America (volume decline in 2024) challenge or support MDLZ's strategic positioning of the category as part of its global snacking portfolio, and what does this reveal about its ability to drive consistent growth across regions?",
      "answer": "In North America (page 53), Cheese & Grocery was a volume/mix gain contributor in 2024, contrasting with Latin America (page 51) where it experienced volume declines and negatively impacted overall regional performance. This divergence challenges MDLZ's strategic emphasis on Cheese & Grocery as a core part of its global snacking portfolio (page 34), suggesting inconsistent execution or market receptivity across regions. While the category contributed positively in North America, the Latin American weakness raises concerns about MDLZ's ability to replicate success in different markets, especially amid macroeconomic pressures and pricing adjustments. This mixed performance indicates potential limitations in leveraging Cheese & Grocery as a consistent growth driver globally, despite its inclusion among 'adjacent, locally relevant categories' in the company's strategy.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors .\n\n## Overview of Business and Strategy\n\nOur  core  business  is  making  and  selling  chocolate,  biscuits  and  baked  snacks,  with  additional  businesses  in  adjacent,  locally  relev ant  categories including gum &amp; candy, cheese &amp; grocery and powdered bev erages around the world.\n\nWe aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to driv e long-term growth by focusing on four strategic priorities: accelerating consumercentric  growth,  driv ing  operational  excellence,  creating  a  winning  growth  culture  and  scaling  sustainable  snacking.  We  believ e  the  successful implementation of our strategic priorities and lev eraging of our attractiv e global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution  and  cost  excellence  capabilities,  and  top  talent  with  a  growth  mindset,  will  driv e  consistent  top-  and  bottom-line  growth,  enabling  us  to continue to create long-term v alue for our shareholders.\n\nFor more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, Business.\n\n## Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nWe continue to observ e significant market and geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating consumer demand, inflationary pressures, supply constraints, trade and regulatory uncertainty and exchange rate v olatility. As a result, we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher ov erall raw material, labor and energy costs that hav e continued to rise. In particular, we expect to continue to face higher cocoa costs, as the market price for cocoa beans has increased significantly year-ov er-year and it is likely that prices will remain elev ated for some time. Refer to Commodity Trends for additional information.\n\nOur overall outlook for future snacks rev enue growth remains strong; howev er, we anticipate ongoing v olatility. We will continue to proactiv ely manage our business in  response  to  the  ev olv ing  global  economic  env ironment,  related  uncertainty  and  business  risks  while  also  prioritizing  and  supporting  our employees and customers.

See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -War in Ukraine, to the consolidated financial statements, and refer to Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results for additional information.\n\nWe have suspended new capital investments and our advertising spending in Russia, but as a food company with more than 2,500 employees in the country, we hav e not ceased operations giv en we believ e we play a role in the continuity of the food supply. We continue to ev aluate the situation in Ukraine  and  Russia  and  our  ability  to  control  our  operating  activ ities  and  businesses  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  comply  with  applicable  international sanctions. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries. During both 2024 and 2023, Ukraine generated 0.4% and Russia generated 2.9% of consolidated net rev enue. The profitability of and the assets held by our Russian business continue to remain abov e historic lev els.

      "question": "How does MDLZ's acquisition of Evirth in late 2024 align with its broader acquisition strategy, given the financial impact of the deal in 2024, the preliminary purchase price allocation, and the strategic rationale for expanding in the cakes and pastries category in China?",
      "answer": "MDLZ's acquisition of Evirth in November 2024, for \u00a51.7 billion ($240 million), aligns with its broader strategy to expand in the cakes and pastries category in China. The preliminary purchase price allocation included $117 million to customer relationships (17-year useful life) and $122 million in goodwill assigned to the AMEA segment, reflecting expansion opportunities and synergies. Despite the early-stage integration costs of $8 million and the inventory step-up charge of $3 million, the acquisition contributed $72 million in incremental net revenues in 2024 on a constant currency basis. This suggests that Evirth supports MDLZ's strategic focus on high-growth snacking segments in key geographies, even amid integration costs and broader challenges like unfavorable volume/mix in other regions.",

        "Hop 1: [MDLZ](page_87) \u2192 [Evirth]: The page references Evirth in the context of purchase price allocation adjustments, indicating that the acquisition is being accounted for under Note 2 and Note 6, with specific intangible asset allocations.",

('Ev irth'), a leading manufacturer of cakes and pastries in China. T he acquisition will continue to expand our growth in the cakes and pastries categories. The cash consideration paid for Ev irth totaled \u00a51.7 billion ($240 million), net of cash receiv ed.\n\nWe are working to complete the v aluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and hav e recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2024.\n\nWithin definite-liv ed intangible assets, we allocated $117 million to customer relationships which hav e an estimated useful life of 17 years. T he fair v alue of customer relationships at the acquisition date was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The fair value measurements are based on significant unobserv able inputs, and thus represent Lev el 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of the intangible assets include discounted cash flows, customer attrition rates and discount rates.\n\nGoodwill of $122 million was determined as the excess of the purchase price ov er the fair v alue of the net assets acquired and arises principally as a result of expansion opportunities and synergies across China. None of the goodwill recognized will be deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the AMEA operating segment. For further detail, refer to Note 6. Goodw ill and Intangible Assets.\n\nWe incurred acquisition integration and contingent consideration adjustment costs of $8 million, acquisition-related costs of $3 million and an inv entory step-up charge of $3 million in 2024.\n\n## Ricolino\n\nOn November 1, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Grupo Bimbo's confectionery business, Ricolino, located primarily in Mexico. The acquisition of Ricolino builds on our continued prioritization of fast-growing snacking segments in key geographies. The cash consideration paid for Ricolino totaled 26 billion Mexican pesos ($1.3 billion), net of cash receiv ed.\n\nWe incurred acquisition integration costs of $21 million in 2024, $50 million in 2023 and $11 million in 2022. In 2022, we also incurred an inv entory stepup charge of $5 million and recorded sev eral items within acquisition-related costs that resulted in income of $64 million as realized gains related to hedging contracts associated with acquisition funds more than offset other acquisition transaction costs.\n\n## Clif Bar\n\nOn August 1, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Clif Bar &amp; Company ('Clif Bar'), a leading U.S. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients. T he acquisition expands our global snack bar business and complements our refrigerated snacking and performance nutrition bar portfolios. The total cash payment of $2.9 billion includes purchase price consideration of $2.6 billion, net of cash receiv ed, and one-time compensation expense of $0.3 billion  related  to  the  buyout  of  the  non-v ested  employee  stock  ownership  plan  (\"ESOP\")  shares.  T his  compensation  expense  is  considered  an acquisition-related cost. We also incurred a contingent consideration liability with an acquisition date fair v alue of $440 million.\n\nWe recorded  a  net  gain  in  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent  consideration  adjustments  of  $393  million  in  2024  and  incurred  acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments of $164 million in 2023 and $30 million in 2022. Refer to Note 10, Financial Instruments for additional information on the changes to the contingent consideration liability. We also incurred acquisition-related costs of $296 million, primarily related to the buyout of the non-v ested ESOP shares, and an inv entory step-up charge of $20 million in 2022.\n\n## Chipita\n\nOn January 3, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Chipita Global S.A. ('Chipita'), a leading croissants and baked snacks company in the Central and Eastern European markets. The acquisition of Chipita offers a strategic complement to our existing portfolio and adv ances our strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. T he cash consideration paid for Chipita totaled \u20ac1.2 billion ($1.4 billion), net of cash receiv ed, plus the assumption of Chipita's debt of \u20ac0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) for a total purchase price of \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.8 billion).",

      "question": "How does Walmart's increasing ownership stake in Flipkart align with its strategic expansion in India and the regulatory risks associated with Flipkart's past operations under Indian foreign investment rules?",
      "answer": "Walmart's increasing ownership in Flipkart from 75% to 85% in fiscal 2024 (as noted in shareholders' equity disclosures) reflects a strategic move to consolidate control over its Indian operations, aligning with its broader omni-channel and eCommerce expansion efforts described in the business overview. However, this expansion is accompanied by regulatory risks, as Flipkart received a show-cause notice from Indian authorities related to alleged violations of Foreign Direct Investment rules from 2009 to 2015. Despite Walmart's belief that this matter will not materially affect its business, the ongoing nature of the proceedings introduces uncertainty around its investment and operational control in India. Together, these elements paint a picture of aggressive strategic positioning in a key growth market, balanced against inherited regulatory exposure.",

      "question": "How does Walmart's competitive positioning against digital advertising companies differ between its U.S. and international operations, particularly in terms of pricing strategy and fulfillment infrastructure investments?",
      "answer": "Walmart\u2019s U.S. operations emphasize an EDLP (Everyday Low Price) pricing strategy and omni-channel offerings like Walmart+ to counter digital advertising competitors, while investing in 162 distribution facilities and 30 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers to support digital competitiveness. In contrast, Walmart International focuses on progressing toward EDLP in various markets while leveraging 176 distribution facilities across multiple countries, including India\u2019s 3,500 eCommerce fulfillment and delivery centers, to support competitive digital fulfillment. Both segments highlight digital advertising companies as key competitors, but the U.S. focuses more on membership and domestic infrastructure, while international operations emphasize geographic expansion and localized fulfillment networks.",

      "question": "Given the ITC's determination that NJOY ACE infringes JUUL's patents, the recent $354 million impairment of the Skoal trademark, and the disclosure that a 1% increase in the discount rate could result in an additional $85 million impairment, how does Altria's legal strategy to challenge the ITC's determination directly connect to mitigating both near-term financial risks to the e-vapor reporting unit and longer-term risks to the Skoal trademark valuation?",
      "answer": "The ITC's determination that NJOY ACE infringes JUUL's patents introduces significant near-term risk to the e-vapor reporting unit, with potential for a material non-cash impairment if the exclusion order takes effect and no viable product solution is implemented. This risk is compounded by the recent $354 million impairment of the Skoal trademark, which was driven by declining MST product volumes and increased discount rates. A 1% further increase in the discount rate could trigger an additional $85 million impairment, signaling sensitivity to assumptions tied to future revenue and macroeconomic factors. In response, Altria has filed a motion for reconsideration of the ITC\u2019s determination, specifically targeting one of the four patents, which directly aims to prevent the enforcement of the exclusion order. If successful, this legal strategy could preserve NJOY ACE's market access, supporting e-vapor revenue projections and potentially stabilizing the broader oral and vapor business, which in turn may help prevent further downward revisions to Skoal trademark assumptions. Thus, the legal challenge is a targeted mitigation effort that addresses both the immediate risk to the e-vapor reporting unit and the downstream implications for the Skoal trademark valuation.",

We concluded that the expected impact from the sales volume declines on the Skoal trademark represented a triggering event and, as a result of this conclusion, we performed an interim impairment assessment as of June 30, 2024. We determined the estimated fair value of the Skoal trademark as of June 30, 2024, was below its carrying value and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of $354 million during the second quarter of 2024, which was recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our estimate of the fair value and carrying value of the Skoal trademark at June 30, 2024 was $3.6 billion after recording the impairment.\n\n2024 Annual Review of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets:\n\nWe completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets performed as of October 1, 2024. We elected to perform a qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets were below carrying value. For certain of our other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we elected to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment.\n\nUpon completion of this testing, we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets ex ceeded their carrying values in all circumstances and thus, no impairment charges were recorded. The estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values for all of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets with the ex ception of our Skoal trademark and e-vapor reporting unit discussed below.\n\nAlthough the estimated fair value of the Skoal trademark exceeded its carrying value of $3.6 billion by approximately 7% ($0.3 billion), MST products, including Skoal , continued to be negatively impacted due in part to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, which have continued to contribute to reductions in sales volumes for MST products, including Skoal, as discussed above. We believe if the decline in sales volume for Skoal is higher than currently estimated and results in material revenue declines, there may be a material adverse effect on the significant assumptions used in performing our valuation. These adverse effects, including if Skoal 's actual revenue and income or long-term outlook are significantly unfavorable compared to forecasted performance used to estimate the fair value or if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value increases, could result in a material non-cash impairment of our Skoal trademark in future periods. Based on the 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment charge to the Skoal intangible asset of approximately $85 million.\n\nWhile the estimated fair value of our e-vapor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 28% ($0.3 billion), we continue to monitor several factors that could impact the carrying value of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill, including the following:\n\n- Altria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY , are defendants in lawsuits alleging patent infringement based on the sale of NJOY ACE in the United States. On January 29, 2025, the ITC issued its final determination regarding the complaint filed by JUUL against Altria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY, finding that NJOY ACE infringes on JUUL's patents and issued an exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders prohibiting the importation and sale of NJOY ACE in the United States. The ITC's determination is currently under a 60-day review period by the Office of the United States Trade Representative which could reject the ITC's determination. If the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC's determination, the determination will automatically become final and the ITC's orders will take effect on March 31, 2025, or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse. The final exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the final ex clusion order and cease-and-desist orders prohibiting the importation and sale of NJOY ACE would likely not be stayed during the pendency of such an appeal. We continue to vigorously defend this litigation, including our motion filed in February 2025 seeking reconsideration of the ITC's determination on one of the four patents as discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K ('Item 3').\n- Additionally, sales of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products continue to increase with limited effective enforcement against these products, contributing to declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume, which negatively impacted NJOY ACE's volume growth in 2024.\n\nWe are pursuing pathways to minimize the disruption the ITC's decision could cause. NJOY is working on a product solution that addresses all of the patents at issue in the event the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC's determination. Additionally, NJOY is pursuing potential solutions with a pipeline of other alternative e-vapor products. However, in the event the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC's determination, it is likely that NJOY will not be able to sell NJOY ACE in the United States until a product solution addressing all of the patents at issue in the ITC action has received the necessary regulatory approvals.\n\nIf we continue to experience unfavorable outcomes with respect to the patent infringement lawsuits and our related strategies, or if continued illicit e-vapor product sales or other factors result in a significantly different long-term outlook for NJOY 's volume growth rates versus projections, there may be a material adverse effect on the significant assumptions used in performing our valuation. These adverse effects, including if NJOY's actual revenue and income or long-term outlook are significantly unfavorable compared to forecasted performance used to estimate the fair value or if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value increases, could result in a",

We concluded that the expected impact from the sales volume declines on the Skoal trademark represented a triggering event, and as a result of this conclusion, we performed an interim impairment assessment as of June 30, 2024. As a result of (i) lower projected revenue and income due to lower volume assumptions, (ii) a decrease in the perpetual growth rate to 0% (1% at October 1, 2023 valuation) and (iii) an increase in the discount rate to 11.5% (11.0% at October 1, 2023 valuation), we determined the estimated fair value of the Skoal trademark as of June 30, 2024, was below its carrying value and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of $354 million during the second quarter of 2024, which was recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our estimate of the fair value and carrying value of the Skoal trademark at June 30, 2024 was $3.6 billion after recording the impairment.\n\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges. Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, the estimated fair values of the e-vapor reporting unit and Skoal trademark exceeded their carrying values by approximately 28% ($0.3 billion) and 7% ($0.3 billion), respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million during 2024. A hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the Skoal trademark would have resulted in an additional impairment charge of approximately $85 million during 2024. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill.\n\nWe use an income approach to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and trademarks. The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the ex pected rate of inflation and the risk associated with realizing ex pected future cash flows.\n\nIn determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and trademarks in 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rate and discount rate. All significant inputs used in the valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nAs further discussed in Note 20. Contingencies , on January 29, 2025, the U.S. International Trade Commission ('ITC') issued its final determination, including the form of remedy, in the complaint filed by JUUL against Altria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY, alleging patent infringement. Due to other factors that are uncertain at this time, we are not able to estimate the impact of the ITC's final determination; however, it could result in a material non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit in future periods.\n\n## Note 7.

      "answer": "Skoal's retail share dropped from 9.3% in 2023 to 7.6% in 2024, indicating a weakening market position. This decline correlates with the impairment of the Skoal trademark in Q2 2024, which signals reduced long-term value expectations for the brand. Meanwhile, Altria's broader strategic focus, as outlined in the MD&A, emphasizes transitioning adult smokers to smoke-free products through brands like NJOY and Helix, rather than maintaining legacy moist snuff brands like Skoal. The combination of declining market share, asset impairment, and strategic redirection suggests a reduced emphasis on Skoal within Altria's portfolio.",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "answer": "Altria's e-vapor reporting unit is highly sensitive to discount rate changes, with a hypothetical 1% increase triggering a $125 million impairment charge, signaling vulnerability in its innovation pipeline. This sensitivity is compounded by its investment in Cronos, which generated a $29 million pre-tax loss in 2023 and carried a $402 million valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at year-end 2024. These financial pressures suggest that Altria's diversification into next-generation tobacco products faces both near-term profitability challenges and long-term strategic uncertainty.

We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We determine the realizability of deferred tax  assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law. As has occurred in prior periods, there is a potential that sufficient positive evidence may be available in future periods to cause us to reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax  assets. That change to the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets and a decrease in income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.\n\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2024 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our JUUL-related capital loss carryforwards. The reductions to valuation allowances during 2024 were due primarily to the $4.0 billion of ordinary losses recognized as part of the IRS Agreement, the reduction of a deferred tax  asset for the portion of our JUUL-related capital losses that is now part of our tax  basis in the shares of a domestic subsidiary and the ABI Transaction. This outside basis difference of the domestic subsidiary is not recognized as a deferred tax asset since we do not expect the temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future. The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our investment in Cronos ($402 million) and our JUUL-related capital loss carryforwards ($207 million).\n\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2023 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our former investment in JUUL. The reductions to valuation allowances during 2023 were due primarily to the reduction of a deferred tax asset for the portion of our JUUL capital losses that is now part of our tax basis in the shares of a foreign subsidiary. This outside basis difference of the foreign subsidiary is not recognized as a deferred tax  asset since we do not expect the temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future. The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our tax basis in the shares of a domestic subsidiary ($1,808 million) and our investment in Cronos ($397 million).\n\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2022 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with decreases in the estimated fair value of our former investment in JUUL. The reductions to valuation allowances during 2022 were due primarily to the anticipated ability to utilize a portion of existing losses related to our former investment in JUUL and the abandonment of our Cronos warrant. The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to deferred tax  assets recorded in connection with our former investment in JUUL ($2,394 million) and our investment in Cronos ($379 million).\n\nFor a discussion regarding our former investment in JUUL and current investments in ABI and Cronos, see Note 8.

For further discussion, see Note 8 and Note 16.\n- ABI-Related Special Items: We recorded net pre-tax expense of $2 million from our investment in ABI for the year ended December 31, 2024, which consists primarily of mark-to-market losses on certain ABI financial instruments associated with its share commitments, mostly offset by a gain related to the ABI Transaction. For further information on the gain related to the ABI Transaction, see Note 8.\n\nWe recorded net pre-tax losses of $89 million from our investment in ABI for the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting primarily of mark-to-market losses on certain ABI financial instruments associated with its share commitments and a loss on ABI's sale of certain brands and associated assets in the United States.\n\nThe ABI-related special items include our respective share of the amounts recorded by ABI and additional adjustments related to (i) the conversion of ABI-related special items from international financial reporting standards to GAAP and (ii) adjustments to our investment required under the equity method of accounting.\n\n- Cronos-Related Special Items: We recorded pre-tax losses of $29 million for Cronos-related special items for the year ended December 31, 2023, substantially all of which related to our share of special items recorded by Cronos. We recorded a corresponding adjustment to the Cronos tax valuation allowance.\n- Income Tax Items: We recorded income tax items of $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, due primarily to an income tax benefit from partial releases of valuation allowances on JUUL-related losses in connection with an agreement reached in October 2024 with the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') and in connection with the ABI Transaction. For further discussion, see Note 16.\n\nWe recorded income tax items of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to tax expense associated with a tax basis adjustment related to our investment in ABI.\n\n## 2024 Compared with 2023\n\nNet revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $465 million (1.9%), due primarily to lower net revenues in the smokeable products segment, partially offset by higher net revenues in the oral tobacco products segment.\n\nCost of sales decreased $141 million (2.3%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in our smokeable products segment, partially offset by higher per unit settlement charges and higher manufacturing costs in our smokeable products segment and higher NJOY costs.\n\nExcise taxes on products decreased $407 million (10.2%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in our smokeable products segment.\n\nMarketing, administration and research costs were unchanged compared to 2023 as higher costs, including NJOY and other costs in support of our Vision and 2024 costs related to the Initiative, were offset by lower general corporate ex penses. The lower general corporate ex penses were due primarily to lower charges to resolve certain JUUL-related litigation and the 2023 settlement of the shareholder derivative lawsuits, partially offset by higher net acquisition-related costs primarily associated with the NJOY Transaction and 2024 transaction costs from the ABI Transaction.
