      "question": "How has the strategic financial relationship between Lowe's and U.S. Bank National Association evolved based on their bond issuance trustee relationship and credit facility arrangements?",
      "answer": "Lowe's relationship with U.S. Bank National Association has evolved from a primarily trustee role in bond indentures to a broader strategic financial partnership involving credit facilities and syndication roles. Initially, U.S. Bank acted as a successor trustee for multiple bond issuances, including the 4.625% Notes maturing in April 2020 and the 5.800% Notes maturing in April 2040 (page_80). Over time, U.S. Bank's role expanded to include participation in credit agreements, such as the 2020 Credit Agreement where it served as a syndication agent and letter of credit issuer (page_83), and by 2021, U.S. Bank was named a co-syndication agent in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (page_85). This progression indicates a deepening strategic financial relationship, with U.S. Bank taking on more active roles in Lowe\u2019s capital structure and liquidity management.",

      "answer": "The decline in revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance by $125 million in fiscal 2023, primarily due to the sale of the Seattle's Best Coffee brand to Nestl\u00e9 and product SKU optimization, must be viewed alongside the accounting policy that recognizes product sales upon shipment and royalty revenues based on a percentage of reported sales (page_65). This accounting treatment remains consistent even as the Channel Development segment, which includes the Global Coffee Alliance, is described as a key revenue contributor through packaged coffee, tea, and royalty revenues from Nestl\u00e9 (page_88). The strategic emphasis on Channel Development contrasts with the short-term revenue drop, suggesting a longer-term focus on brand partnerships and product portfolio optimization despite the immediate impact of divesting a major brand.",

The fair value of these structured deposits was $261.2 million as of October 1, 2023, as shown in the fair value table on page 74.

The maturity-related cash inflows align with the company\u2019s short-term investment strategy, while the fair value changes directly impact earnings, as gains or losses\u2014though stated as immaterial\u2014are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.

      "answer": "Starbucks' exposure to foreign currency - other derivatives is reflected across three perspectives: (1) balance sheet assets and liabilities show $1.9M in prepaid assets and $4.7M in accrued liabilities for foreign currency - other as of Sep 29, 2024; (2) cash flow hedge activity shows $28.2M reclassified from AOCI to earnings in 2024, indicating realized impact on revenue; and (3) the year-over-year change in derivative values dropped from $1,164M (Oct 1, 2023) to $920M (Sep 29, 2024), signaling reduced overall exposure. Together, this shows a strategic reduction in foreign currency hedging with corresponding impacts on both earnings and balance sheet positioning.",

      "question": "How does Starbucks' revenue recognition policy for ready-to-drink beverages sold through third-party partners like PepsiCo and Nestl\u00e9 align with their segment performance and supply chain strategy, particularly in terms of financial contribution, production control, and distribution responsibilities?",
      "answer": "Starbucks recognizes revenue for ready-to-drink beverages sold through third-party partners like PepsiCo and Nestl\u00e9 upon shipment, as outlined in the revenue recognition section. These sales are primarily recorded in the Channel Development segment, which contributed 5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2024. In terms of supply chain, Starbucks retains control over coffee purchasing, roasting, and packaging for its branded products, while in some cases, Nestl\u00e9 handles distribution and may also roast and package products under the Global Coffee Alliance. This structure allows Starbucks to maintain product quality while leveraging partner logistics networks.",

      "question": "How does Starbucks' exposure to tea as a commodity risk factor align with its revenue generation through tea sales in company-operated stores and its strategic positioning within the Channel Development segment?",
      "answer": "Starbucks identifies tea as a commodity risk in its supply chain due to potential cost increases or availability issues, which could materially impact profitability (page_22). However, tea also contributes to revenue through its inclusion in the 'Other' category, which encompasses packaged and single-serve teas sold in company-operated stores (page_88). Additionally, tea is part of the 'Other Revenues' in the Channel Development segment, which includes sales of packaged tea to external customers and is tied to strategic partnerships like the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 (page_12). This multi-faceted role of tea\u2014both as a cost-sensitive input and a revenue-generating product\u2014means that Starbucks must balance supply chain volatility with its strategic importance in both retail and wholesale operations.",

In 2022, the maturity distribution shows that the full $179 million investment matures within the first three years, with $105 million maturing in 2022 and $52 million in 2023 (page_31). This indicates a strategic shift toward very short-term foreign government instruments, likely to enhance liquidity flexibility and reduce exposure to longer-duration assets.",

      "answer": "Amazon reported a significant increase in cost of sales in 2021 due to global supply chain constraints, which contributed to higher shipping and fulfillment costs, including a jump from $61.1 billion in 2020 to $76.7 billion in 2021. This trend was acknowledged in their Q1 2022 guidance, where they noted continued uncertainty and pressure from supply chain constraints, contributing to a projected decline in operating income compared to the prior year. In the MD&A section, Amazon emphasized that these constraints are part of a broader set of external risks affecting their financial performance, including inflation and labor market issues, and are factored into their long-term strategy of managing variable costs and investing in fulfillment network optimization to mitigate future impacts.",

Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $61.1 billion and $76.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\n\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as 'Technology and content' as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\n\n## Fulfillment\n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in 'Fulfillment,' AWS costs are primarily classified as 'Technology and",

These forwardlooking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of February 3, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.' This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 3, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above.\n\n## First Quarter 2022 Guidance\n\n- Net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $117.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8% compared with first quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n- Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in first quarter 2021. This guidance includes approximately $1.0 billion lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning on January 1, 2022.\n- This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forwardlooking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management's expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.'\n\n## Overview\n\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.\n\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See 'Results of Operations - NonGAAP Financial Measures' below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\n\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\n\nBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle . On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales 1\n\nThe operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 1",

      "answer": "Amazon's investment in Other Fixed Income Securities decreased from $710 million in 2020 to $686 million in 2021, reflecting a decline in fair value. In 2022, the maturity distribution shows $142 million maturing in 2022 and $264 million in 2023, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.83%.

      "answer": "Amazon's investment in U.S. government and agency securities decreased from $7,410 million in 2020 (page_50) to $4,316 million in 2021 (page_51). This decline is reflected in the maturity profile (page_31), where the total estimated fair value of these securities stood at $4,300 million as of December 31, 2021, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.65%. The drop in investment value aligns with a broader shift in portfolio composition, as Amazon reallocated more toward corporate debt and asset-backed securities, which saw increases in both value and interest rates over the same period.",

      "answer": "Amazon reports that its deferred tax assets are presented net of tax contingencies, indicating a conservative approach to asset valuation (page 64). The company also excludes approximately $3.2 billion of accrued tax contingencies from its long-term obligations due to uncertainty in timing and amount of payment (page 57). In its income tax accounting, Amazon applies a two-step recognition and measurement process for uncertain tax positions, which includes interest and penalties in income tax expense (page 45). These perspectives collectively suggest a cautious and structured approach to managing tax uncertainties, especially in foreign jurisdictions where earnings are largely intended to be reinvested indefinitely.",

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these warrants had a fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, and are recorded within 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a writedown of inventory, was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.",

Our Strategy reflects the Company's purpose, mission and values, as well as growth pillars that build on the Company's competitive advantages. The Company's guiding purpose, mission and values are discussed in a dedicated section on page 4 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## GROWTH PILLARS\n\nThe following growth pillars, M -C-D, build on historic strengths and articulate areas of further opportunity. Under our Strategy, the Company will:\n\n- Maximize our Marketing by investing in new, culturally relevant approaches, grounded in fan truths, to effectively communicate the story of our brand, food and purpose. The Company continues to build relevance with customers through emotional connections and world class creative, which are central to the brand's 'Feel-Good M arketing' approach. This is exemplified by campaigns that elevate the entire brand and continue to be scaled around the globe to connect with customers in authentic and relatable ways. The Company is committed to a marketing strategy that highlights value at every tier of the menu, as providing delicious and affordable menu options remains a cornerstone of the M cDonald's brand. This includes everyday low-price options on our menu, affordable meal bundles, limited-time deals and personalized value and digital offers available in our mobile app.\n- Commit to the Core menu by tapping into customer demand for the familiar and focusing on serving our iconic products that are beloved by customers around the world such as our World Famous Fries, Big M ac, Quarter Pounder and Chicken M cNuggets, which are some of our seventeen unique billiondollar brands. Building on its foundational strength with burgers, the Company will continue to evolve and innovate its longest-standing menu item with plans to implement 'Best Burger'; a series of operational and formulation changes designed to deliver hotter, juicier, tastier burgers to nearly all markets by the end of 2026. Further, the Company is focused on continuing to gain share in the rapidly growing chicken category, as we continue to aggressively grow our chicken brands. This includes plans to offer the M cCrispy sandwich in nearly all markets by the end of 2025 and to extend the M cCrispy brand into strips and wraps in several markets. These planned innovations and new menu offerings reflect the Company's ability to meet evolving customer preferences. The Company also continues to see a significant opportunity with beverages, such as coffee, demonstrated by markets leveraging the M cCaf\u00e9 brand, customer experience, value and quality to drive long-term growth.\n- Double Down on the 4D's: Digital, Delivery, Drive Thru and Restaurant Development by continuing to leverage competitive strengths and building a powerful digital ex perience growth engine to deliver a personalized and convenient customer experience. A s another way to unlock further growth, the Company plans to continue to accelerate the pace of restaurant openings and technology innovation so that whenever and however customers choose to interact with McDonald's, they can enjoy a fast, easy experience that meets their needs.\n- Digital: The Company's digital experience is transforming how customers order, pay and receive their food. Through digital tools, customers can access personalized offers, participate in a loyalty program, order through our mobile app and receive M cDonald's food through the channel of their choice. In the U.S., we are providing increased convenience to customers through 'Ready on A rrival'; a digital enhancement that enables crew to begin assembling a customer's mobile order prior to arrival at the restaurant to expedite service and elevate customer satisfaction. The Company plans to deploy this initiativ e in its top six  markets by  the end of 2025. The Company has successful loyalty programs in 60 markets, including its top six markets. M cDonald's loyalty customers have proven to be highly engaged, and the Company plans to increase its 90-day active users to 250 million by the end of 2027. Further, the Company plans to grow its annual Systemwide sales to loyalty members to $45.0 billion by the end of 2027.\n- Delivery: The Company offers delivery from over 38,000 restaurants across approximately 100 markets, representing nearly 90% of M cDonald's restaurants. The Company is continuing to build on and enhance the delivery experience for customers, including adding the ability to place a delivery order in our mobile app (a feature that is currently available in five of the Company's top markets). The Company continues to scale this capability and expects to increase the percentage of Systemwide delivery sales originating from our mobile app to 30% by the end of 2027. The Company also has long-term strategic partnerships with delivery providers that continue to benefit the Company, customers and franchisees by optimizing operational efficiencies and creating a seamless customer experience.\n- Drive Thru: The Company has the most drive thru locations worldwide, with nearly 28,000 drive thru locations globally, including over 95% of the over 13,500 locations in the U.S. This channel remains a competitive advantage in meeting customers' demand for flexibility and choice. McDonald's network currently provides unmatched scale and convenience for customers, while also offering significant growth opportunities, such as adding additional drive thru lanes to increase capacity and improve speed and efficiency. The Company continues to build on its drive thru advantage, as the vast majority of new restaurant openings in the U.S. and International Operated M arkets will include a drive thru.\n- Restaurant Development: The Company will continue to accelerate the pace of restaurant openings to attempt to fully capture the demand being driven through our Strategy in many of our largest markets. In 2025, the Company plans to open about 2,200 new restaurants across the globe, which will contribute to slightly  ov er 4% new unit growth (net of closures). Further, the Company continues to build on its industry-leading development, by progressing toward the targeted expansion to 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027, which would make it the fastest period of restaurant unit growth in Company history.",

Y ou should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\n\n## ABOUT McDONALD'S\n\nMcDonald's Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the \"Company.\" The Company, its franchisees and suppliers are referred to herein as the \"System.\"\n\n## BUSINESS SUMMARY\n\n## GENERAL\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no material changes to the Company's corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. Refer to the Segment and Geographic Information section on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE  B U SIN E SS\n\nThe Company franchises and owns and operates M cDonald's restaurants, which serve a locally relevant menu of quality food and beverages in communities across more than 100 countries. Of the 43,477 M cDonald's restaurants at year-end 2024, approximately 95% were franchised.\n\nThe Company's reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\") and International Operated M arkets. In addition, there is the International Developmental Licensed Markets &amp; Corporate segment, which includes the results of over 75 countries as well as Corporate activities.\n\nMcDonald's franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. The business relationship between the Company and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies, including McDonald's Global Brand Standards, and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the M cDonald's brand.\n\nThe Company is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability . Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of M cDonald's global brand, operating system and financial resources.\n\nDirectly operating M cDonald's restaurants contributes significantly to the Company's ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from Company-owned and operated restaurants allows M cDonald's to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, the Company is able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies.\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022, third-party revenues for the Company's Dynamic Yield business.\n\n## Conventional Franchise\n\nUnder a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and d\u00e9cor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry.",

The Company has established and enforces high food safety and quality standards. The quality management systems and processes involve ongoing product reviews, supplier visits and third-party v erifications with performance expectations. The Company requires periodic third-party food safety audits of suppliers to verify compliance with its food safety and quality standards. The audits help ensure that suppliers are meeting M cDonald's Supplier Quality M anagement System (SQM S) standards. In addition, the Company promotes the consistency of its core menu by regular sensory evaluations and calibration trainings. A  digital transformation project is underway to promote data excellence and continuous measures on quality and food safety performance. A  Food Safety A dvisory Council, comprised of the Company's internal food safety experts as well as suppliers and outside experts, supports the Company's food safety risk management work and provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety and quality. The Company also has ongoing programs to elevate food safety culture throughout the business by educating employees about food safety practices, including proper storage, handling and preparation of food for customers, and conducting trainings for its suppliers and restaurant operators to share best practices on food safety and quality.\n\nThe Company collaborates with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous improvement across its global supply chain. The Company also works closely with suppliers and other third-party experts to drive sustainable sourcing initiatives and to improve the health and welfare of the animals within its supply chain. Led by its Global Chief Supply Chain Officer, the Company has a comprehensive strategy that its global supply chain organization leverages to identify , assess, and manage risk in its supply chain.\n\nTo reinforce the importance of its values, the Company maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to all of its suppliers. The Company expects all of its suppliers to meet the rigorous standards set forth in the Code, which cover areas including human rights, workplace environment, business integrity and environmental management. In addition, the Company has a comprehensive Supplier Workplace Accountability (SWA) program to help suppliers understand its expectations, verify compliance and work toward continuous improvement.\n\n## PRODUCTS\n\nMcDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes.\n\nMcDonald's menu features hamburgers and cheeseburgers, the Big M ac, the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the Filet-O-Fish, and several chicken sandwiches like the M cChicken, M cCrispy and M cSpicy, as well as Chicken M cNuggets, World Famous Fries, shakes, M cFlurry frozen desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, cookies, pies, soft drinks, coffee, M cCaf\u00e9 beverages and other beverages.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include breakfast sandwiches, such as the Egg M cM uffin, Sausage M cM uffin with Egg and M cGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches, oatmeal, hash browns, breakfast burritos and hotcakes.\n\nIn addition to these menu items, restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions.\n\nTaste, quality, choice, value and nutrition are important to customers, and the Company is continuously evolving its menu to meet its customers' needs, including testing new products on an ongoing basis.\n\n## MARKETING\n\nMcDonald's global brand is well known. M arketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed with customers in mind and are focused on promoting the M cDonald's brand and differentiating the Company from its competitors. M arketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience, cultural relevance and the customer experience.\n\n## INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY\n\nThe Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the \"M cDonald's\" trademark and the Golden A rches Logo to be of material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. The Company's patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nMcDonald's restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of traditional, fast casual and other food service competitors. The Company measures its competitive position within the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, which is inclusive of the Company's primary competition of quickservice restaurants, but also includes 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, convenience stores, street stalls or kiosks, caf\u00e9s, specialist coffee shops, selfservice cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The Company competes among quick-service restaurants primarily on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety and product quality.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS\n\nThe Company has global operations and is therefore subject to the laws of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. A s discussed under 'Legal Proceedings - Government Regulations' on page 37 of this Form 10-K, governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business, including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, competition, zoning, employment and taxation.\n\nWhile costs associated with legal and regulatory compliance have increased along with the number and scope of laws and regulations affecting our business, these costs are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 6",

      "question": "How does McDonald's financial treatment of franchisee-related gains and losses align with its risk disclosures about franchisee dependency and its revenue recognition policies tied to franchise operations?",
      "answer": "McDonald's recognizes gains and losses from franchise-related transactions as part of operating income due to their recurring nature, reflecting a strategic and ongoing financial relationship with franchisees. In 2024, this included $221 million in pre-tax restructuring charges tied to refranchising activities, highlighting the financial impact of ownership mix adjustments. Simultaneously, the company acknowledges significant operational risks tied to franchisee performance, including their ability to fund major initiatives, maintain brand consistency, and manage labor and supply chain challenges\u2014all of which can materially affect McDonald's financial results. On the revenue side, McDonald's recognizes franchise-related income through royalties, rent, and initial fees, with royalty and variable rent income recognized as sales occur, aligning with the ongoing economic dependency on franchisee sales performance. This creates a comprehensive financial model where McDonald's both benefits from and is exposed to the financial and operational health of its franchisees across strategic, risk, and revenue dimensions.",

The broader impact of acts of war and related sanctions, including on macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical tensions, consumer demand and the ability of us and our franchisees to operate in certain geographic areas, may also have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\nWhile we may face challenges and uncertainties in any of the markets in which we operate, such challenges and uncertainties are often heightened in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. A n inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure a reliable and sufficient supply of quality products, equipment and other materials on favorable terms. A lthough many of these items are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain items have limited suppliers, which increases our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases have in the past and may in the future adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, inflationary pressures, unexpected increases in demand, transportation-related issues, labor-related issues, technology-related issues, weather-related events, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control or that of our suppliers or franchisees. Interruptions in our System's supply chain or ineffective contingency planning can increase our costs, impact ingredient quality, delay new restaurant openings, and/or limit the quality  or av ailability  of products, equipment and other materials that are critical to our Sy stem's operations or to restaurant development.\n\n## Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-owned and operated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. If franchisee sales trends worsen, or any of such risks materialize or intensify, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors, including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.\n\n## Continued challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nOur success depends in part on our System's ability to effectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in M cDonald's restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. We and our franchisees have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in adequately staffing certain M cDonald's restaurants, which can negatively impact operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System's ability to meet its labor needs as they evolve is generally subject to a variety of factors, including the availability  of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.\n\nFurther, our System has experienced increased costs and competition associated with attracting, recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at M cDonald's restaurants. We and our franchisees also continue to be impacted by increasingly complex U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting our respective workforces. These laws and regulations are increasingly focused on, and in certain cases impose requirements with respect to, employment matters such as wages and hours, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Such laws and regulations can expose us and our franchisees to increased costs and other effects of compliance, including potential liability, and all such labor and compliance costs could have a negative impact on our Company-owned and operated margins and franchisee profitability.\n\nOur potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. A dditionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to attract, recruit, dev elop, motiv ate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.",

ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the new standard in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to the Segment footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for the enhanced disclosures added as a result of the adoption of A SU 2023-07.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid.

We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

      "question": "How does McDonald's treatment of developmental licensees in revenue recognition and franchise agreements align with its accounting policy decisions regarding consolidation and expense recognition, particularly in light of the new FASB standards adopted in 2024?",
      "answer": "McDonald's recognizes revenue from developmental licensees based on a percentage of sales as royalties, with initial fees recognized over the franchise term, aligning with the broader franchised model that contributes to 95% of global restaurants. This revenue treatment is detailed in the revenue section, where it is emphasized that fees from developmental licensees are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Meanwhile, in the consolidation section, McDonald's explicitly states that entities like developmental licensees are evaluated for variable interest entity status, but generally not consolidated due to scope exceptions, indicating a policy of non-control over these entities. Finally, in the accounting pronouncements section, the adoption of ASU 2023-07 on segment reporting and ASU 2024-03 on expense disaggregation signals a broader push toward transparency and detailed expense reporting, which must be reconciled with the current revenue and consolidation policies involving developmental licensees. Together, these sections show that while McDonald's leverages developmental licensees for revenue predictability, it maintains a clear separation in both accounting treatment and control assumptions.",

The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022, third-party  rev enues for the Company's Dynamic Y ield business.\n\nFranchised restaurants represented approximately 95% of M cDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2024. The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, and resulting cash flow streams. In 2024, the Company provided an immaterial amount of assistance, including royalty relief and/or deferral of cash collection for certain franchisees.\n\nRevenues\n\n",

      "question": "How does McDonald's use of foreign currency forwards across its hedging strategies align with its exposure management priorities and financial statement impacts, particularly when considering their role in cash flow hedges, net investment hedges, and undesignated derivative activities?",
      "answer": "McDonald's utilizes foreign currency forwards across multiple hedging frameworks to manage different types of exposures. In cash flow hedges (page 50), the company uses $2.0 billion in foreign currency forwards to protect against variability in forecasted foreign currency cash flows such as royalties, with $119 million in cumulative hedging gains expected to flow through earnings over time. In net investment hedges (page 51), $1.9 billion of foreign currency derivatives are used to offset translation adjustments on foreign subsidiaries, aligning with the company\u2019s strategy to stabilize equity impacts from currency fluctuations. Additionally, foreign currency forwards are also used in undesignated hedging (page 51) to mitigate changes in fair value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, with fair value changes immediately impacting non-operating income. This multi-layered approach reflects a comprehensive risk management strategy that addresses both earnings volatility and balance sheet exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third-party and intercompany) and foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. A s of December 31, 2024, $13.1 billion of the Company's third-party foreign currency denominated debt, $168 million of the Company's intercompany foreign currency denominated debt and $1.9 billion of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\n## Undesignated Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. Therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A s an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. The Company may also use certain investments to hedge changes in these liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives or investments are recorded in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in non-operating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2024 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in its financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. A t December 31, 2024, the Company was required to post $21 million of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') to employees and nonemployee directors.\n\nShare-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses.\n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized each period.\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company's stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a M onte Carlo valuation model.\n\nRefer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 63 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION\n\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2024-3.6; 2023-4.4; 2022-4.8. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutiv e were (in millions of shares): 2024-1.9; 2023-2.0; 2022-1.5.\n\n## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. A s of December 31, 2024, Cash and equivalents was $1.1 billion of which $451 million consisted of certificates of deposit.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 51",

We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

      "answer": "McDonald's relies heavily on franchisees for revenue, with approximately 95% of its 41,822 restaurants franchised in 2023, and generates income through rent, royalties based on sales, and initial fees. However, this model presents risks such as franchisees' inability to manage supply chain interruptions or labor challenges, which could limit their sales growth and thus McDonald's royalty income. Additionally, while franchisees are responsible for their own capital investment and operations, the company's financial disclosures clarify that franchise-related revenues are recognized under specific contractual terms, including minimum rent payments and variable royalty structures. These factors together suggest that McDonald's financial health is closely tied to franchisee performance, yet the accounting treatment does not consolidate franchisee financials, limiting visibility into their actual financial health and increasing exposure to risks outlined in the risk factors.",

      "question": "What is the comprehensive role of foreign currency forwards in McDonald's risk management strategy, considering their use in cash flow hedging, undesignated hedging, and their impact on fair value disclosures?",
      "answer": "McDonald's utilizes foreign currency forwards across multiple dimensions of its financial risk management. In cash flow hedging, the company uses $1.9 billion in foreign currency forwards to protect against variability in forecasted foreign currency cash flows, such as royalties. In undesignated hedging, foreign currency forwards are used to mitigate changes in the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, with gains and losses recognized directly in earnings. Additionally, these instruments are part of the broader derivatives portfolio, which is disclosed at fair value on the balance sheet, contributing to adjustments in earnings and other comprehensive income. Together, these uses show a layered strategy to manage exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations across different financial contexts.",

      "answer": "Mortgage notes are disclosed in three contexts: (1) in the long-term debt maturity schedule, they appear as a minimal $2 million obligation due through fiscal 2027 with a 6.24% interest rate; (2) in the fair value disclosures, both the carrying amount and fair value are listed as $2 million for fiscal 2024, showing no material deviation; and (3) the valuation methodology for mortgage notes is described as using discounted cash flow analyses based on future cash outflows and the company's incremental borrowing rate. This alignment indicates that despite the use of complex valuation techniques, the fair value of mortgage notes equals their carrying amount, suggesting minimal market risk or volatility for this component of debt.",

      "answer": "Lowe's highlights Building Materials as one of only two product categories with comparable sales growth in fiscal 2023 (page 28), attributing this strength to demand from Pro customers. This aligns with the company's supply chain strategy, where Flatbed Distribution Centers (FDCs) are specifically designed to handle merchandise like building materials that require special handling due to size or packaging (page 6). The company has expanded its Pro fulfillment network, which stocks deeper quantities of top Pro assortments and has enhanced capabilities for handling large orders across multiple flatbeds. Despite overall sales declines, Building Materials' positive performance combined with targeted supply chain investments suggests Lowe's is strategically positioning itself to better serve Pro customers, potentially supporting margin sustainability through improved fulfillment efficiency and product availability for this high-demand segment.",

      "answer": "McDonald's explicitly states that it does not consolidate franchisee entities in its financial statements, citing that they generally qualify for a scope exception under variable interest entity guidance (page 43). However, the company acknowledges that franchisee operations significantly influence brand perception and customer experience, noting that adverse commentary about franchisee practices could harm the brand and financial results (page 28). Furthermore, McDonald's strategic investments in customer experience enhancements\u2014such as digital engagement, mobile ordering, and delivery\u2014depend on franchisee execution, and failure to implement these effectively could negatively impact business results (page 29).

          "chunk_text": "\nThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonald's China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented.\n\n## ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standard Update ('ASU') No. 2019-12, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes' ('ASU 2019-12'), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\" ('ASU 2020-04'). The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Leases\n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued No. ASU 2021-05, \"Leases (Topic 842): Lessors-Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments\" (\"ASU 202105\"). The pronouncement amends the current guidance on classification for a lease that includes variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. Under the amended guidance, a lessor must classify as an operating lease any lease that would otherwise be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease and that would result in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement. ASU 2021-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including applicable interim periods. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business. If any of these risks materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## GLOBAL PANDEMIC\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our financial results, condition and outlook.\n\nHealth epidemics or pandemics can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our financial results, condition and outlook. Importantly, the global pandemic resulting from COVID-19 has disrupted global health, economic and market conditions, consumer behavior and McDonald's global restaurant operations since early 2020, and has resulted in increased pressure on labor availability and supply chain management. Local and national governmental mandates or recommendations and public perceptions of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and we expect will continue to cause, consumer behavior to change, worsening or volatile economic conditions in certain markets, and increased regulatory complexity and compliance costs, each of which could continue to adversely affect our business. In addition, our global operations have been disrupted to varying degrees in different markets and may continue to be disrupted to varying degrees given the unpredictability of the virus, its resurgences and variants and government responses thereto as well as potentially permanent changes to the industry in which we operate. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of infections or the emergence of new variants in one or more markets, the availability, acceptance or effectiveness of vaccines or vaccination rates across the globe, the pandemic has negatively impacted our business and is expected to continue to impact our financial results, condition and outlook in a way that may be material.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, those related to labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand and competition.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including the Accelerating the Arches strategy, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, such as our marketing, core menu items and digital, delivery and drive thru;\n- continue to innovate and differentiate the McDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- accelerate technology investments for a fast and easy customer experience;\n- continue to run great restaurants by driving efficiencies and expanding capacities while continuing to prioritize health and safety;\n- identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and potential acquisitions, investments and partnerships; and\n- evolve and adjust our business strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, operational restrictions and impacts to our results of operations and liquidity, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at McDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, as well as by our position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.",

          "chunk_text": "## If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to environmental and social responsibility matters, in the IEO segment. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors predict or respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer behavior and preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies and marketing plans, as well as the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy. However, they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, which could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.\n\nAdditionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively, efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them. If our advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.\n\n## Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization, digital engagement and delivery in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which may not generate expected results. We also continue to offer and refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction, and may introduce additional food quality, food safety and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer experience initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.\n\n## We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.\n\nWe compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores, coffee shops and online retailers. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions, product offerings or consolidation of our competitors and third-party partners, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.\n\nWe compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in technology and modernization, and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business.\n\n## We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald's brand and our business.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to do so in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.\n\nWe cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.",

The reclassification impact on earnings is further contextualized by the $22.0 million reclassified from AOCI to earnings, affecting both licensed stores revenues and product and distribution costs.

      "question": "How does the financial structure of Starbucks' Global Coffee Alliance relationship with Nestl\u00e9 inform its revenue deferral practices compared to the Starbucks Rewards program?",
      "answer": "Starbucks recognizes revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance through product sales and royalties, with a portion of revenue deferred due to an upfront prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9 for which Starbucks has continuing performance obligations (page_62). This deferred revenue is part of a broader liability that also includes unredeemed Stars from the Starbucks Rewards program, where revenue is deferred based on the estimated value of free products expected to be redeemed (page_62). The Channel Development segment, which includes the Global Coffee Alliance, saw a 16% increase in revenue in fiscal 2022 (page_31), indicating growing importance of this partnership and the associated deferred revenue obligations. Unlike the Rewards program, where deferrals are tied to customer behavior and redemption rates, the Global Coffee Alliance deferral stems from contractual arrangements with Nestl\u00e9, highlighting two distinct mechanisms for revenue recognition and deferral within Starbucks' financial practices.",

They earn loyalty points ('Stars') in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit cards. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\n\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months.\n\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms.\n\nOther revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9 related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestl\u00e9 are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $416.7 million, $305.1 million and $258.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## General\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2022 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter, and fiscal year 2020 included 52 weeks; comparable store sale percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week.\n\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nOur financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&amp;A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n\n- New store openings and store count\n- Comparable store sales\n- Operating margin\n\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2022 demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment excluding China, partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\n\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 12% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 22% and 21% for the North America segment and the U.S. market, respectively, in fiscal 2021. Average ticket for the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 7% and 8%, respectively, primarily driven by strategic pricing and increased demand for food items in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to investments and growth in labor including enhanced store partner wages as well as increased spend on new partner training. Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers.\n\nFor the International segment, comparable store sales decreased by 9% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 16% in fiscal 2021, driven by comparable store sales decline of 24% in our China market. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, our China market experienced COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. Outside of China, strong growth in our major International markets, driven by product innovation and increasing digital capabilities, partially offset the unfavorability in our China market.\n\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment increased $250 million, or 16%, when compared with fiscal 2021, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints as well as business mix shift.\n\nDespite COVID-19 induced business interruptions, especially in our China market, we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain to continue to a lesser extent in fiscal 2023, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin, as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate that these should be offset by benefits from pricing decisions as well as from increased sales leverage and higher productivity driven by our Reinvention Plan. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.",

However, other commodity futures contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and their changes in fair value are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on the consolidated statements of earnings (page 56). Additionally, Starbucks pledged $75.6 million in cash collateral related to commodity derivative margin requirements as of October 2, 2022, which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets (page 71).

The primary indicators of the credit quality of our receivables are aging, payment history, economic sector information and outside credit monitoring, and are assessed on a quarterly basis. Our credit loss exposure is mainly concentrated in our accounts receivable portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated using a loss-rate method based on historical experience, current market conditions and reasonable forecasts. We also assessed incremental risks due to COVID-19 on our licensees' financial viability. For the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, our allowance for credit losses was $27.2 million and $25.6 million, respectively.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, inventory reserves were $43.1 million and $36.6 million, respectively.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives.\n\nThe portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in",

Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following:\n\nLevel 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value.\n\nLevel 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of certain assets based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.\n\nLevel 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity.\n\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWe manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nWe record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, cash collateral held under collateral security arrangements was $74.3 million and $44.7 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 2, 2022, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $75.6 million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $72.5 million and is included in cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nBy using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ('OCI') and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings.",

They earn loyalty points ('Stars') in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit cards. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\n\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months.\n\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms.\n\nOther revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9 related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestl\u00e9 are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $416.7 million, $305.1 million and $258.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

To help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. Nestl\u00e9 controls distribution of certain finished goods through the Global Coffee Alliance. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single-origin coffees.\n\nThe price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.\n\nWe buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge 'C' price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2023.\n\nWe depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.\n\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of",

The up-front payment of approximately $7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestl\u00e9 access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment is being recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we will satisfy our performance obligations.\n\nAt October 2, 2022, the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestl\u00e9 up-front payment was $177.0 million and $6.2 billion, respectively.

Despite the short-term revenue decline, Starbucks continues to recognize $176.5 million annually from the prepaid royalty over a 40-year period, as outlined in the deferred revenue section. This suggests that while immediate revenue from the alliance may have dipped due to strategic brand divestitures, the financial benefits from the original licensing deal remain a stable, long-term revenue contributor.

See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability.

The up-front payment of approximately $7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestl\u00e9 access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment is being recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we will satisfy our performance obligations.\n\nAs of September 29, 2024, the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestl\u00e9 up-front payment was $177.0 million and $5.8 billion, respectively.

      "question": "How does Starbucks' discussion of its $3.0 billion 2021 credit facility across liquidity disclosures, debt structure details, and corporate financial strategy reflect its approach to managing short-term financing capacity, covenant compliance, and future capital allocation priorities?",
      "answer": "Starbucks maintains a $3.0 billion 2021 credit facility that serves as a backstop for its commercial paper program and supports working capital, capital expenditures, and corporate purposes such as dividends and share repurchases. As of September 29, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under this facility, and the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (page_79). The facility, which matures in September 2026 and can be expanded by $1.0 billion with bank agreement, supports Starbucks' liquidity strategy by ensuring access to short-term funding, which aligns with the company\u2019s belief that cash flows and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet capital needs and shareholder distributions (page_46). This is further reinforced by Starbucks' $3.8 billion in cash and investments as of the end of fiscal 2024, including $2.1 billion held in foreign subsidiaries, which the company actively manages to fund interest and principal payments, acquisitions, and shareholder returns (page_45). Together, these perspectives illustrate a conservative and flexible capital structure approach that prioritizes liquidity resilience and strategic financial flexibility.",

As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\n\n## Use of Cash\n\nWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program, and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases, and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.\n\nWe believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the nex t 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the nex t 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest ex pense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases, refinancing debt maturities, as well as investing in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.\n\nWe regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes, which could be material. Any foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at management's discretion. During fiscal 2024, we paid approximately $18 million for foreign withholding taxes related to repatriating the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.

If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale.\n\nChannel Development revenues include packaged coffee, tea, foodservice products, and ready-to-drink beverage sales to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores.

      "question": "How does Starbucks' supply chain risk disclosure for tea compare to its financial reporting treatment of tea products and their categorization in revenue streams, particularly when considering supplier dependency and gross margin implications?",
      "answer": "Starbucks' supply chain risk disclosure on page 13 indicates that tea, like coffee and dairy, is sourced from specialty suppliers under long-term contracts, with the company asserting that the risk of non-delivery is remote due to established supplier relationships. In contrast, page 59 of the 10-K categorizes tea as part of the broader product portfolio under brands like Teavana\u00ae, noting its inclusion in both company-operated store sales and licensed channels such as the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. However, page 88 reveals that tea products fall under the 'Other' revenue category, which includes packaged coffees, royalty income, and serveware\u2014distinct from the core 'Beverage' and 'Food' segments that likely carry higher gross margins. This suggests that while tea is treated with similar supply chain assurance as core products, its financial reporting categorization may obscure its individual margin contribution, potentially affecting how investors assess its strategic importance relative to coffee and dairy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields as well as agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\n\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote.\n\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional, and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service, and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\n\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and foodservice accounts and also compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\n\n## Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents, and Domain Names\n\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, and Frappuccino, are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\n\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems, and designs, which have an average remaining duration of approximately thirteen years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including 'Starbucks.com,' 'Starbucks.net,' and 'Starbucksreserve.com.'\n\n## Seasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to, and loaded by, customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Starbucks Cards, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations, and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations, and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.",

We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 S.A. ('Nestl\u00e9'). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee\u00ae brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana\u00ae, Ethos\u00ae, and Starbucks Reserve\u00ae.\n\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K ('10-K' or 'Report') for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024 ('fiscal 2024'), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as 'Starbucks,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our.'\n\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our ceo, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, manages the segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions.\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nAdditional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\nCertain prior period information at Note 7, Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information, has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Fiscal Year End\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 included 52 weeks.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations, commitments and contingencies, and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of these restructuring efforts, we recorded approximately $22 million and $46 million to restructuring and impairments in our consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. No restructuring and impairment costs attributable to this plan were recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal year 2024.\n\nAs of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables and third-party payment processing receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal.",

      "answer": "Nike's APLA segment reported $6,729 million in revenue and $1,885 million in operating income for fiscal 2024 (page_90). This reflects a -2% change in operating income compared to the prior year (page_41), indicating a decline in profitability. Concurrently, the filing notes a strategic shift in certain APLA countries where Nike transitioned its brand businesses to third-party distributors (page_89), suggesting a restructuring effort to improve efficiency or focus on core markets. Together, these data points indicate that Nike is recalibrating its geographic segmentation strategy in APLA by outsourcing operations in some markets while managing a slight downturn in financial performance, aligning its structure with evolving regional market dynamics.",

T he Company's reportable operating segm ents for the N IKE  Brand are: N orth Am erica; E urope, M iddle E ast &amp; Africa (\"E M E A\"); G reater C hina; and Asia P acific &amp; Latin Am erica (\"AP LA\"), and include results for the N IKE  and Jordan brands.

G lobal Brand D ivisions revenues include NIKE  Brand licensing and other m iscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segm ent.

These rates are set approxim ately nine and twelve m onths in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and sum m er selling seasons) based on average m arket spot rates in the calendar m onth preceding the date they are established.

      "question": "How does the financial contribution of Converse compare to its role in Nike's broader revenue structure and licensing strategy, especially when examining profitability, revenue composition, and licensing-related corporate activities?",
      "answer": "Converse contributed $2,082 million in revenue in 2024, a decline from $2,427 million in 2023, and generated $474 million in earnings before interest and taxes in 2024, down from $676 million in the prior year, indicating a decline in its profitability. In terms of revenue composition, in 2023, Converse's revenue was primarily from footwear ($2,155 million), followed by apparel ($90 million), and equipment ($28 million), with an additional $154 million categorized as 'Other'\u2014likely including licensing revenue. Corporate revenues, which include foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to both Nike Brand and Converse, were minimal at $27 million in 2023, suggesting that Converse's licensing activities, while present, were not a dominant factor in Nike\u2019s overall corporate-level financials. This shows that while Converse remains a recognizable brand with a licensing component, its financial performance weakened in 2024 and its licensing activities play a relatively minor role in Nike\u2019s broader corporate revenue strategy.",

      "answer": "Nike's foreign exchange risk management program significantly influenced both segment-level product cost accounting and corporate-level financial results in fiscal 2024. At the segment level, standard foreign currency rates were assigned twice a year to geographic operating segments and Converse to account for non-functional currency product purchases, with the variance between these standard rates and actual market rates recorded at the corporate level. This practice created a $588 million favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses at the corporate level, which was reported as part of consolidated gross profit. Additionally, the company used derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options, to hedge foreign currency exposures including product costs, intercompany revenues, and demand creation expenses, further stabilizing financial results. The centralized management of these exposures allowed Nike to delay the impact of exchange rate movements on financial statements, aligning with the program's goal of reducing volatility in consolidated results.",

Our prim ary foreign currency exposures arise from  the recording of transactions denom inated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denom inated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U .S. D ollars.\n\nOur foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. W e m anage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks m aterial to N IKE , Inc. W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and m aterial, by hedging a portion of the rem aining exposures using derivative instrum ents such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the im plem entation of the N IKE  T rading C om pany (\"N T C \") and our foreign currency adjustm ent program  enhanced our ability to m anage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the im pact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. W here exposures are hedged, our program  has the effect of delaying the im pact of exchange rate m ovem ents on our C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instrum ents for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 44",

      "answer": "GM's accounting treatment of product warranty and recall liabilities reflects materiality and complexity through a multi-layered approach: the auditor identifies a $10.6 billion liability as a critical audit matter due to the high subjectivity in estimating future claims (page_53). The notes to financial statements explain that these liabilities are accrued at the time of sale using historical data on claim frequency, cost, and model-year-specific factors (page_66). Management further acknowledges that estimates are highly sensitive to variables like the number of recall events, vehicle take rates, and repair costs, and are re-evaluated regularly based on new data (page_42). Together, these sections show a consistent but nuanced approach where estimation risk, historical modeling, and forward-looking assumptions converge to shape financial reporting.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2024,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Product warranty and recall campaigns\n\n## Description of the matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the liabilities for product warranty and recall campaigns amount to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2024. The Company accrues for costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\n\nAuditing these liabilities involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management's estimates due to the size, uncertainties, and potential volatility related to the estimated liabilities. Management's estimates consider historical claims experience, including the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line,  and  the  key  assumptions  of  historical  data  being  predictive  of  future  activity  and  events,  specifically  the number of historical periods used and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies.",

Cash equivalent pricing utilizes observable inputs and are classified in Level 2.\n\nCommon and Preferred Stock Common and preferred stock for which market prices are readily available at the measurement date are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or ex change on which they are actively traded and are classified in Level 1. Such equity securities for which the market is not considered to be active are valued via the use of observable inputs, which may include the use of adjusted market prices last available, bids or last available sales prices and/or other observable inputs and are classified in Level 2. Common and preferred stock classified in Level 3 are privately issued securities or other issues that are valued via the use of valuation models using significant unobservable inputs that generally consider aged (stale) pricing, earnings multiples, discounted cash flows and/or other qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\nDebt  Securities Valuations for debt securities are based on quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities.  Debt securities priced via pricing services that utilize matrix  pricing which considers readily observable inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices, are classified in Level 2. Debt securities that are typically priced by dealers and pricing services via the use of proprietary pricing models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are classified in Level 3. These inputs primarily consist of yield and credit spread assumptions, discount rates, prepayment curves, default assumptions and recovery rates.\n\nInvestment  Funds,  Private  Equity  and  Debt  Investments  and  Real  Estate  Investments Investment funds, private  equity  and  debt  investments  and  real  estate investments are valued based on the Net Asset V alue (NAV ) per Share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of readily available market prices.\n\nNAVs are provided by the respective investment sponsors or investment advisers and are subsequently reviewed and approved by management. In the event management concludes a reported NAV does not reflect fair value or is not determined as of the financial reporting measurement date, we will consider whether and when deemed necessary to make an adjustment at the balance sheet date. In determining whether an adjustment to the external valuation is required, we will review material factors that could affect the valuation, such as changes in the composition or performance of the underlying investments or comparable investments, overall market conditions, expected sale prices for private investments which are probable of being sold in the short-term and other economic factors that may possibly have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the reported external valuation.\n\nStock Incentive Plans Our stock incentive plans include RSUs, PSUs, stock options and awards that may be settled in our stock, the stock of our subsidiaries or in cash. We measure and record compensation expense based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock on the date of grant for RSUs and PSUs and the grant date fair value, determined utilizing the Black-Scholes formula or a lattice model, for stock options and PSUs. We record compensation cost for service-based RSUs, PSUs and service-based stock options on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, or for retirement eligible employees over the requisite service period. Compensation cost for awards that do not have an established accounting grant date, but for which the service inception date has been established or are settled in cash is based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock at the end of each reporting period.\n\nIn March 2022, all outstanding RSUs that settle in Cruise's common stock were modified to remove the liquidity vesting condition. Prospectively, RSUs that will settle in Cruise's common stock will vest solely upon satisfaction of a service condition. In April 2024, substantially all remaining outstanding unvested Cruise RSUs were exchanged by participants for unvested cash payment rights. The remaining outstanding Cruise RSUs are insignificant and are presented in permanent equity. Prior to the April 2024 modification, compensation cost was recorded on stock issued to settle awards based on the fair value of Cruise's common stock until such time that the stock had been issued for more than six months.\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold and are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. Revisions are made when necessary and are based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated costs related to recall campaigns are accrued when probable and estimable.

We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\n\nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate",

In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. We are pursuing the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Cruise, and as of December 31, 2024, we owned about 97% of Cruise. Following the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests and subject to approval of the Cruise Board of Directors, we expect to work with the Cruise leadership team to restructure Cruise's operations and combine the GM and Cruise technical efforts to build on the success of Super Cruise, our ADAS technology, and prioritize the development of ADAS on a path to fully autonomous personal vehicles. While we expect our refocused AV  strategy to be less capital intensive than the Cruise robotaxi plan, we expect that our  AV  and  ADAS  development  activities  will  continue  to  require  significant  capital  investments  and  remain  subject  to  a  variety  of  risks  inherent  with  the development of new technologies, including our ability to continue to develop self-driving software and hardware; attract and retain key software talent with expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning; access to sufficient capital; and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to AV technologies than we do. In addition, we face risks related to the commercial deployment of AVs, including consumer acceptance, reputation of our brand, achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal, state, provincial or local regulations. Advanced technologies such as AV s present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas, and our relationships with regulators, could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty. To the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse  events  associated  with  our  autonomous  driving  systems  occur,  we  could  be  subject  to  liability,  reputational  harm,  government  scrutiny  and  further regulation, and it could deter consumer adoption of AV  and ADAS technology. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, changing consumer preferences and other risks related to our transition to EVs and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure. Increasing attention to climate change,  rising  societal  ex pectations  on  companies  to  address  climate  change,  requirements  for  increased  disclosure  and  changes  in  consumer  and  investor preferences  may  result  in  increased  costs,  reduced  demand  for  our  products,  reduced  profits,  risks  associated  with  new  regulatory  requirements,  risks  to  our reputation and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigations. Regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit emissions associated with customer use of products we sell, change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional ex pense, including the purchase of emissions credits or the payment of penalties, which may be material. These requirements may increase the cost of, and/or diminish demand for, our ICE vehicles. See 'Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.' In addition, at the state and federal level in the U.S. and abroad there are an increasing number of sustainability-related rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed. Such regulations are expected to subject us to new disclosure requirements, new supply chain requirements, new trade restrictions and increased risk of litigation or regulatory action, which are expected to result in increased costs (in our operations and supply chain), as well as risks to our reputation or consumer demand for our products if we do not meet increasingly demanding stakeholder expectations and standards.  Furthermore, our practices may be judged against sustainability  standards  that  are  continually  evolving  and  not  always  clear.  Prevailing  sustainability  standards,  ex pectations  and  regulations  may  also  reflect contrasting or conflicting values or agendas.\n\nPart of our strategy to address these risks includes the continued scaling of EV s, which presents additional risks, including reduced demand for, and therefore profits from, our ICE vehicles, which we are currently using to fund our growth strategy and transition to EV s; higher costs or reduced availability of materials related to  EV   technologies,  whether  as  a  result  of  increased  competition  or  more  stringent  regulatory  requirements,  impacting  profitability,  particularly  with  respect  to batteries and battery raw material; risks related to the success of our EV  strategy, particularly with respect to advancement of battery cell technology, charging infrastructure and competition; and uncertainty over treatment of EV s in vehicle emission standards. See 'Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a strategic portfolio of EV s' and 'Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUV s and full-size ICE pickup trucks.'\n\nFinally, increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts, wildfires or other severe weather events as a result of climate change may disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and procurement of products from our suppliers, timely delivery of vehicles to customers and operations of our dealers, and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers and dealers. Such weather events may also adversely impact the financial condition of our",

Business\n\nGeneral Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, G eneral Motors or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development of autonomous vehicle (AV ) technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs)  and  AV s,  software-enabled  services  and  subscriptions  and  new  business  opportunities,  while  strengthening  our  market  position  in  profitable  internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\n\nElectric Vehicles We are offering customers choice with our diverse EV  lineup. A key element in our EV  strategy is our dedicated EV  propulsion architecture. Our current-generation, flexible EV  platform is being deployed across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, leveraging our technology to expand our EV portfolio over a wide and growing variety of segments and price points. With our next-generation battery technology, we intend to expand to multiple chemistries, multiple form factors and multiple cell suppliers as we continue to deliver even more EV choices for our customers.\n\nTo support our expanding portfolio of EV s, we have made significant investments in our plants across North America. GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center is a fully dedicated EV  facility which produces a variety of vehicles, including the GMC HUMMER EV  Pickup and SUV , the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the recently launched Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, with globally sourced parts. GM's CAMI Assembly is Canada's first full-scale EV  manufacturing facility. We plan to convert Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan to build electric pickups, with the plant slated to begin production in 2026. GM is also investing in our propulsion, stamping and components plants to support EV production. We are mass-producing battery cells for these and other future EV s through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG  Energy Solution) in plants in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with plans to expand our battery cell manufacturing footprint, including in Indiana through a joint venture with Samsung SDI.\n\nGM's all-electric future is guided by customer choice and focused on delivering a world-class portfolio of EV s and an ecosystem to support them, while maintaining a compelling lineup of gas-powered vehicles. GM EV  drivers have access to more than 231,000 chargers across North America. This includes access to more than 20,000  Tesla  Superchargers  with  the  use  of  a  G M-approved  North American  Charging  Standard  adapter.  In  2024,  GM  also  announced  that  it  will  enhance  its collaboration with EV go to build 2,850 DC fast charging stalls, including 400 fast chargers at flagship destinations in major metropolitan areas across the U.S. GM is also a founding member of IONNA, a joint venture with seven other automakers aiming to create a high-powered charging network with a targeted installation of at least 30,000 chargers in urban and highway locations throughout North America. The joint venture broke ground on its first charging station in October 2024.\n\nSoftware-Enabled Services and Subscriptions Our vehicles are equipped with a suite of software-enabled services, including OnStar services, Super Cruise and others. With nearly three decades of experience, OnStar is a global leader in enabling automotive services. OnStar is currently available in 20 markets globally and growing. As  GM  introduces  more  software-defined  vehicles,  OnStar  is  playing  a  key  role  as  an  enabler  of  active  safety,  infotainment,  connectivity  and  driver assistance features. OnStar provides one ecosystem for retail and fleet customers to use, engage and shop through a broader set of service offerings available at and after vehicle purchase.

Super  Cruise  enables  drivers  of  properly  equipped  vehicles  to  travel  hands-free  on  more  than  530,000  miles  of compatible roads, and soon to be approximately 750,000 miles, in the U.S. and Canada. Additional software-enabled features are expected to be available in the near future including security features, climate and comfort options, personal themes and EV  ownership experience elements. Many of GM's latest electric and internal combustion vehicles are employing this software platform as it rolls out across most products in the coming years.\n\nCruise GM Cruise Holdings LLC (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV  technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. We are pursuing the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Cruise, and as of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 97% of Cruise.

Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of the risks associated with our AV strategy.\n\nOver the last year, we have engaged and actively cooperated with certain federal and state agencies who opened investigations or made inquiries to us and Cruise in connection with an accident involving a Cruise robotaxi in October 2023. We and Cruise have resolved the investigations and inquiries by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the U.S. Department of Justice and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Specifically, in July 2024, Cruise entered into a settlement agreement with the CPUC that imposed a $112,500 fine on Cruise and various reporting obligations. In September 2024, Cruise and NHTSA executed a Consent Order, which imposed a $1.5 million fine on Cruise and requires enhanced reporting and engagement with NHTSA for two years (with an optional third year at NHTSA's discretion). In November 2024, Cruise entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California relating to the October 2023 accident. Under the terms of the DPA, Cruise admitted to one count of submitting a false report to a federal agency and paid a $500,000 monetary penalty. The government will not pursue an indictment or prosecution so long as Cruise complies with the terms of the DPA over the next three years by undertaking certain remedial measures, maintaining a safety compliance program and submitting reports to the government no less than annually. GM is neither a party nor a signatory to these agreements.\n\nCompetitive Position and V ehicle Sales The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy or range and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.\n\nWe present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and market share. Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors, as well as sales to the U.S. government, and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2024, 27.9% of our wholesale  vehicle  sales  volume  was  generated  outside  the  U.S.  The  following  table  summarizes  wholesale  vehicle  sales  by  automotive  segment  (vehicles  in thousands):\n\n",

Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation\n\nGeneral Motors Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled  services  and  subscriptions  worldwide.  We  also  provide  automotive  financing  services  through  GM  Financial.  We  analyze  the  results  of  our operations through the following segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development of AV  technology. Corporate includes certain centrally recorded income and costs such as interest, income taxes, corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part  of  a  reportable  segment.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  conformity  with  U.S.  G AAP .  Ex cept  for  per  share  amounts  or  as  otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n\nThroughout this report, we refer to G eneral Motors Company and its consolidated subsidiaries in a simplified manner and on a collective basis, using words like \"we\", \"our\", \"us\" and \"the Company.\" This drafting style is suggested by the SEC and is not meant to indicate that G eneral Motors Company, the publicly traded parent company, or any particular subsidiary of the parent company, owns or operates any particular asset, business or property. The operations and businesses described in this report are owned and operated by distinct subsidiaries of General Motors Company.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation We consolidate entities that we control due to ownership of a majority voting interest and we consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in our consolidated operating results using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the affiliate.\n\nUse of E stimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented.  We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.\n\nGM Financial The amounts presented for GM Financial are adjusted to reflect the impact on GM Financial's deferred tax positions and provision for income taxes resulting from the inclusion of GM Financial in our consolidated tax return and to eliminate the effect of transactions between GM Financial and the other members of the consolidated group. Accordingly, the amounts presented will differ from those presented by GM Financial on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe accounting policies that follow are utilized by our automotive, automotive financing and Cruise operations, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nAutomotive Automotive net sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled  in  exchange  for  vehicle,  parts  and accessories and services and other sales. The consideration recognized represents the amount received, typically shortly after the sale to a customer, net of estimated dealer and customer sales incentives we reasonably expect to pay. Significant factors in determining our estimates of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time. A portion of the consideration  received  is  deferred  for  separate  performance  obligations,  such  as  maintenance,  services  and  vehicle  connectivity,  that  will  be  provided  to  our customers at a future date. Taxes assessed by various government entities, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, collected at the time of the vehicle sale are excluded  from Automotive  net  sales  and  revenue.  Costs  for  shipping  and  handling  activities  that  occur  after  control  of  the  vehicle  transfers  to  the  dealer  are recognized at the time of sale and presented in Automotive and other cost of sales.",

We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. We have substantial cash requirements going forward,  which  we  plan  to  fund  through  our  total  available  liquidity,  cash  flows  from  operating  activities  and  additional  liquidity  measures,  if  determined  to  be necessary.\n\nOur known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital spending and our investments in our battery cell manufacturing joint ventures of approximately $10.0 billion to $11.0 billion in 2025; (2) payments for engineering and product development activities, including the development of AV technology  and  software-enabled  services;  (3)  payments  associated  with  previously  announced  vehicle  recalls  and  any  other  recall-related  contingencies;  (4) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (5) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our Board of Directors; (6) payments to purchase shares of our",

      "question": "How does GM's financial performance in 2024 reflect the strategic importance of Ultium Cells Holdings LLC, particularly in relation to equity earnings contributions, restructuring impacts, and the entity's integration into automotive cost of sales?",
      "answer": "GM's 2024 financial performance shows that Ultium Cells Holdings LLC contributed $0.7 billion in increased equity earnings, directly benefiting EBIT-adjusted profitability (page_34). This aligns with the presentation of equity earnings from Ultium in 'Automotive and other cost of sales' on both page_104 and page_105, where the entity is described as 'integral to the operations of our business by providing battery cells for our EVs.' Additionally, restructuring actions across segments (notably Cruise and GM I) on both pages highlight operational adjustments that may be indirectly tied to optimizing Ultium's integration into GM's EV supply chain. Together, these perspectives show Ultium's dual role as both a strategic asset and a cost/earnings lever within GM's broader transformation.",

      "answer": "Tesla offers resale value guarantees in certain vehicle leasing programs, which obligate the company to cover potential resale losses or repurchase vehicles at predetermined values. This creates a contingent liability tied to future vehicle values. The guarantee is also referenced in restricted cash disclosures, where cash held as collateral for these programs is classified as restricted, indicating Tesla must set aside funds to cover potential obligations. However, these future obligations are not included in payment tables because the cash payments were received upfront, suggesting Tesla treats these guarantees as already monetized but still carries the risk of future value erosion.

      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla issued $3.93 billion in aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with interest rates ranging from 0.36% to 4.64% and maturity dates from December 2023 to September 2025 (as shown in the consolidated financial data on page 76 and the detailed disclosure on page 77).

This indicates a reduction in the total principal amount and a shortening of the maturity timeline in 2023, suggesting Tesla may be adjusting its non-recourse financing strategy to align with shorter-term liquidity needs or asset turnover cycles, while also benefiting from lower interest rate tranches.",

      "question": "How does Tesla's $894 million increase in R&D spending on AI programs align with the regulatory scrutiny around Autopilot and its strategic emphasis on self-driving technology leadership?",
      "answer": "Tesla's $894 million year-over-year increase in R&D spending, driven in part by investments in AI and other programs, directly supports the development of Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities. However, this development occurs amid significant regulatory scrutiny, as the company acknowledges that evolving and inconsistent regulations across international, federal, and state jurisdictions may delay, restrict, or prohibit the availability of certain self-driving functionalities. Despite these regulatory challenges, Tesla strategically positions Autopilot and FSD as key differentiators in its vehicle offerings, emphasizing continued progress on self-driving technologies as a core competitive advantage. The alignment suggests Tesla is aggressively investing in AI-driven autonomy to maintain leadership in the space, even as it navigates a complex and evolving regulatory landscape that could constrain deployment timelines and feature availability in different markets.",

      "question": "How does Tesla's investment in Cybertruck development, as reflected in R&D spending growth, align with its production ramp plans and revenue expectations for the vehicle within the broader automotive segment?",
      "answer": "Tesla's R&D expenses increased by $894 million in 2023, driven in part by preproduction costs for the Cybertruck. This aligns with Tesla's broader production strategy outlined in its manufacturing and demand planning section, where the Cybertruck is positioned as a key new model in Tesla's roadmap, supporting future growth through production ramping and cost reduction initiatives. However, while the Cybertruck is included in the list of vehicles contributing to automotive sales revenue, the 2023 revenue growth of $11.30 billion was primarily attributed to Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, suggesting that the Cybertruck had not yet significantly contributed to revenue during the year. This indicates that the investment in Cybertruck development is forward-looking, aimed at future production and revenue growth rather than immediate returns in 2023.",

        "Hop 3: Tesla (page_39) \u2192 Cybertruck: Cybertruck is listed among vehicles contributing to automotive sales revenue, but 2023 revenue growth was primarily driven by Model 3 and Model Y, implying limited immediate financial impact from Cybertruck."

      "question": "How do Amazon's $X billion in restricted cash obligations tied to third-party sellers align with the 2023 increase in payment processing costs and Amazon's strategic positioning of sellers as core to their business model?",
      "answer": "Amazon's restricted cash obligations tied to third-party sellers, which include pledged or otherwise restricted portions of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, directly support their financial commitments to these sellers in certain jurisdictions (page 53). This financial obligation is compounded by the fact that sales by third-party sellers carry higher payment processing and transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to Amazon's own retail sales (page 27). Despite these increased costs, Amazon strategically positions third-party sellers as a core component of their business model, offering programs that allow sellers to grow their businesses, utilize fulfillment services, and access Amazon's customer base (page 3). The alignment reveals a deliberate trade-off: Amazon accepts higher operational costs and maintains significant financial commitments to support third-party sellers, reinforcing their broader marketplace strategy of offering a vast selection of products and services.",

      "question": "How does Amazon's exposure to administrative practices related to tax regulations reconcile with its current tax contingencies, specific international disputes, and the potential financial impact of future changes in tax laws?",
      "answer": "Amazon faces significant exposure from evolving administrative practices related to tax regulations, as outlined in its 10-K. Specifically, the company has $5.2 billion in income tax contingencies as of December 31, 2023, with $3.3 billion of that amount potentially impacting its effective tax rate if recognized. These contingencies stem from ongoing disputes in multiple jurisdictions, including India, where the tax authority asserts that taxes apply to cloud service fees paid to Amazon in the U.S., and Luxembourg, where the tax authority denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets distributed to the U.S. in 2021. Amazon is contesting both positions and expects to recoup taxes paid, but if resolved adversely, these matters could result in significant additional tax expenses. Additionally, the company notes that changes in tax laws, administrative practices, and interpretations\u2014especially in response to global tax framework shifts\u2014could materially affect its tax liabilities and financial position. This aligns with the broader risk statement that Amazon is subject to numerous international tax controversies and that the outcomes of these disputes are inherently uncertain, with potential material effects on operating results and cash flows.",

      "question": "How does Amazon's reliance on networking equipment through finance leases and infrastructure spending align with its broader capital allocation priorities and operational expense trends?",
      "answer": "Amazon's reliance on networking equipment is evident through multiple lenses. First, as of December 31, 2023, the company held $68.0 billion in gross assets under finance leases, which include server and networking equipment, indicating a significant capital commitment to infrastructure (page_55). This leasing strategy supports the technology and infrastructure costs outlined on page_45, which include depreciation and amortization for networking equipment as part of the broader infrastructure expenses. Finally, page_65 highlights how depreciation and amortization of such infrastructure assets influence Amazon's operational expense trends, showing a direct link between capital allocation to networking equipment and its impact on expense management. Together, these perspectives illustrate how Amazon's leasing and infrastructure spending support its capital strategy while shaping expense dynamics.",

This team handles building quotes, answering questions over video or phone call, and providing personalized support to our customers. We are also implementing technology that allows our customers to finalize their installation contract and checkout on lowes.com or mobile application, so they do not need to return to the store.

      "answer": "GM values the Stellantis warrants using a Black-Scholes model based on the Stellantis stock price and estimated dividend yield, with changes in fair value recorded in 'Interest income and other non-operating income, net' (page 66). These warrants are part of a broader set of equity investments subject to equity price risk, where a 10% adverse change in Stellantis stock price would have had an 'insignificant' impact on fair value at $1.5 billion in 2021 (page 50).

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  whose  local  currency  is  not  their  functional  currency  are  remeasured  from  their  local  currency  to  their  functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.\n\nGains  and  losses  arising  from  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  effects  of  remeasurements  discussed  in  the  preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains were $17 million, losses of $203 million and gains of $85 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  each  derivative  financial  instrument  depends  on  whether  it  has  been  designated  and qualifies  as  an  accounting  hedge,  as  well  as  the  type  of  hedging  relationship  identified.  Derivative  instruments  are  not  used  for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nAutomotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk. The change in fair value of option and forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of the Stellantis warrants using a Black-Scholes formula. The significant inputs to the model include the Stellantis stock price and the estimated dividend yield. We are entitled to receive any dividends declared by Stellantis through the conversion date upon exercise of the warrants. Gains or losses as a result of the change in the fair value of the Stellantis warrants are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as hedges is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nCertain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is  the  interest  rate  and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions.

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

Our dealers  often  offer  more  than  one  GM  brand  at  a  single  dealership  in  a  number  of  our  markets. Authorized  dealers  offer  parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty, and those repairs are made almost exclusively with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts, which may be provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions.\n\nThe  quality  of  GM  dealerships  and  our  relationship  with  our  dealers  are  critical  to  our  success  given  that  they  maintain  the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific  regulatory  requirements  and  standards  for  initiating  dealer  network  changes,  pursuing  terminations  for  cause  and  other contractual matters.\n\nResearch, Product Development and Intellectual Property Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services, including activities related to vehicle and GHG emissions control, improved fuel economy, EVs, AVs and the safety of drivers  and  passengers.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nWe  have  listed  below  the  most  material  risk  factors  applicable  to  us.  These  risk  factors  are  not  necessarily  in  the  order  of importance or probability of occurrence:\n\n## Risks related to our competition and strategy\n\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will  continue  to  experience  significant  change  in  the  coming  years,  particularly  as  traditional  automotive  original  equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the  entrance  of  start-ups  and  other  non-traditional  competitors  in  the  automotive  industry.  These  new  competitors,  as  well  as established  industry  participants,  are  disrupting  the  historic  business  model  of  our  industry  through  the  introduction  of  new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer  sales channels, methods  of  transportation  and  vehicle  ownership.  To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that  are  outside  of  our  historically  core  ICE  business,  such  as  EVs  and A Vs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.\n\nOur vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any constraints  on  lending  due  to  concerns  about  climate  change,  our  ability  to  execute  on  our  strategic  plans  could  be  adversely affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\n\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\n\nOur ability  to  maintain  profitability  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  timely  fund  and  introduce  new  and  improved  vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with market  participants  routinely  introducing  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  and  features  designed  to  meet  rapidly  evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility  to  adjust  personnel  costs  to  changes  in  demands  for  our  products,  may  further  exacerbate  the  risks  associated  with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\n\nOur  long-term  strategy  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  profitably  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  EVs. The  production  and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future.  In  2021,  we  increased  our  commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV strategy  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  high-quality  EVs  that  are  competitive  and  meet  consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.",

      "question": "How does GM's investment strategy in Ultium Cells LLC align with its broader capital allocation priorities, especially considering the magnitude of annual commitments versus actual spending in 2021 and the impact on automotive liquidity?",
      "answer": "GM has committed to investing approximately $9.0 billion to $10.0 billion annually in Ultium Cells LLC over the medium term, as stated in its capital allocation priorities. However, in 2021, GM only spent $0.5 billion on this investment, as shown in both the consolidated cash flow statement and the detailed investing activities table. This discrepancy suggests a phased or future ramp-up in spending. Furthermore, this investment, along with others like the $1.0 billion in Cruise, contributed to a $3.7 billion decline in automotive available liquidity in 2021, highlighting the immediate cash flow impact of these strategic investments despite their long-term growth intent.",

Our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target ROIC-adjusted rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to  shareholders.  Our  senior  management  evaluates  our  capital  allocation  program  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  recommends  any modifications to the program to our Board of Directors, not less than once annually.\n\nOur  liquidity  plans  are  subject  to  a  number  of  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  described  in  the  \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&amp;A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, some of which are outside of our control.\n\nWe continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners as well as strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business.\n\nIn January 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to $5.0 billion of our common stock with  no  expiration  date,  as  part  of  our  common  stock  repurchase  program.  We  have  completed  $1.7  billion  of  the  $5.0  billion program through December 31, 2021.\n\nCash flows that occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows.  Such  eliminations  include,  among  other  things,  collections  by Automotive  on  wholesale  accounts  receivables  financed  by dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by Automotive to GM Financial, loans to Automotive from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive, tax payments by GM Financial to Automotive and Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity, Cruise liquidity and GM Financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.\n\nAutomotive  Liquidity Total  available  liquidity  includes  cash,  cash  equivalents,  marketable  debt  securities  and  funds  available under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.",

      "question": "How does Amazon's exposure to special tax regimes influence both its effective tax rate volatility and potential future liabilities, particularly in light of the $7.1 billion and $9.3 billion tax provisions recorded in 2023 and 2024, and how might this exposure be impacted by the proliferation of unilateral tax measures and ongoing international tax controversies?",
      "answer": "Amazon's exposure to special tax regimes contributes significantly to the volatility of its effective tax rate, as noted in the Income Taxes section, where factors such as the mix of income across jurisdictions and the applicability of special regimes are cited as key variables. The company recorded tax provisions of $7.1 billion and $9.3 billion in 2023 and 2024, respectively, which are directly influenced by these regimes and the uncertainty around their application. Additionally, the proliferation of unilateral tax measures targeting online commerce, such as new sales or value-added tax obligations, increases Amazon's exposure to unexpected tax liabilities, as outlined in the risk factors. These new obligations could result in retroactive assessments or penalties, especially in jurisdictions where Amazon may not have sufficient time to implement compliance systems. Furthermore, ongoing international tax controversies, such as the Indian tax authority's assertion regarding cloud services fees, could lead to material differences between estimated and actual tax liabilities, impacting both current and future tax expenses. The combination of these factors\u2014special regime applicability, evolving tax obligations, and unresolved international disputes\u2014creates a complex landscape that directly affects Amazon's tax provision and overall financial performance.",

Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.\n\n## We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\n\nWe are subject to a variety of tax es and tax  collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax  ex pense and be subject to additional tax  liabilities, including other liabilities for tax  collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax , including changes to the global tax  framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For ex ample, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted tax es on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax  measures may continue unless broader international tax  reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.\n\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax  reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\n\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax  benefits, the applicability of special or ex traterritorial tax  regimes, changes in foreign ex change rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\n\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax  assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax  applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase.

Our effective tax  rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax  income or loss. For ex ample, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible ex penses on our effective tax  rate is greater when our pre-tax  income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax  assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.\n\nWe recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $7.1 billion and $9.3 billion in 2023 and 2024. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 - Income Taxes' for additional information.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nonGAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by 'Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.' The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, 'Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,' for 2023 and 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions.

In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax  assets.\n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax  benefits, the applicability of special tax  regimes, changes in foreign ex change rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax  assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax , including changes to the global tax  framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.

Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from ex pectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $1.8 billion in comparison with the prior year.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities ('foreign funds'). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2024, of $25.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.3 billion, $2.6 billion, and $5.1 billion.\n\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2024, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $305 million, $605 million, and $1.2 billion, recorded to 'Other income (expense), net.'\n\nSee Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates' for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Equity Investment Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and private companies was $22.1 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $4.6 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2024, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. We record our available-for-sale convertible debt investments in private companies at fair value, which primarily relate to Anthropic, PBC. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(49.8) billion and $(94.3) billion in 2023 and 2024, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital ex penditures. Cash capital ex penditures were $48.1 billion, and $77.7 billion in 2023 and 2024, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect cash capital ex penditures to increase in 2025, primarily driven by investments in technology infrastructure. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $5.8 billion and $7.1 billion in 2023 and 2024. We funded the acquisition of 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In Q3 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a convertible note from Anthropic, PBC. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a third convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025.\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(15.9) billion and $(11.8) billion in 2023 and 2024. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $18.1 billion and $5.1 billion in 2023 and 2024. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $34.0 billion and $17.0 billion in 2023 and 2024. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $642 million and $854 million in 2023 and 2024.\n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2024. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $6.3 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included accelerated depreciation deductions for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these ex penses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income tax es (net of refunds) totaled $11.2 billion and $12.3 billion for 2023 and 2024.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $503 million and $3.5 billion. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' and 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the nex t twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.",

We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or ex penses.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are ex pensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.6 billion. Total video and music expense was $18.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such investments are included in 'Cash and cash equivalents' or 'Marketable securities' on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Ex pected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Non-Marketable Investments\n\nNotes that are convertible to equity classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Credit losses, if any, are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion, the amount of the notes reported at fair value are reclassified generally from available-for-sale to equity investments accounted for at cost, with any associated unrealized gain or loss reclassified from 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' to 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a third convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025. The notes are classified as available-for-sale and are classified as Level 3 assets, and as of December 31, 2024 had an estimated fair value of approx imately $13.8 billion. In making these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of the convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates of expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, a portion of the notes were converted to nonvoting preferred stock. As a result of this conversion, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and",

Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\n\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\n\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\n\n## Return Allowances\n\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in 'Accrued expenses and other' and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in 'Inventories' on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in 'Fulfillment' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Vendor Agreements\n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.",

      "question": "How does The Home Depot's use of Restoration Plans align with its broader capital allocation strategy involving share repurchases and its formal compensation framework?",
      "answer": "The Home Depot uses Restoration Plans to provide deferred compensation in the form of company stock for certain associates, which aligns with its capital allocation strategy involving share repurchases and its structured compensation framework. The Restoration Plans are funded through contributions to grantor trusts that purchase shares of Home Depot common stock in the open market (page_73). This mirrors the company\u2019s broader capital allocation activity, as seen in page_31, where 5,865 deferred stock units were credited under the Restoration Plans in fiscal 2024, further reinforcing the use of company stock as a compensation vehicle. The formal naming of the plans\u2014'Home Depot FutureBuilder Restoration Plan and HDSupply Restoration Plan' (page_3)\u2014reflects a structured, long-term approach to executive and key associate compensation, which integrates with both the company's capital deployment via stock-based incentives and its broader financial strategy of returning value to shareholders through repurchases and deferred compensation.",

We believ e that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds av ailable from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to inv est in the business, fund div idend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next sev eral fiscal years. In addition, we believ e we hav e the ability to obtain alternativ e sources of financing, if necessary.\n\nOur material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes inv esting in the business, followed by paying div idends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In March 2024, we paused share repurchases in anticipation of the acquisition of SRS and do not hav e plans to resume share repurchases in fiscal 2025.",

However, SRS was excluded from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting due to the SEC's guidance allowing exclusion of acquired businesses for one year post-acquisition.

Controls and Procedures.\n\n## DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executiv e Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executiv e Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has ev aluated the effectiv eness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period cov ered by this report. Based on that ev aluation, our Chief Executiv e Officer and Chief Financial Officer hav e concluded that, as of the end of the period cov ered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effectiv e.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control ov er financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under the superv ision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executiv e Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an ev aluation of the effectiv eness of our internal control ov er financial reporting as of February 2, 2025 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our ev aluation, our management concluded that our internal control ov er financial reporting was effectiv e as of February 2, 2025 in prov iding reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\n\nManagement excluded SRS, which was acquired on June 18, 2024, from our assessment of internal control ov er financial reporting as of February 2, 2025. SRS represents approximately 7% of the Company's consolidated total assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets, and approximately 4% of the Company's consolidated net sales as of and for the year ended February 2, 2025. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff's general guidance that an assessment of an acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management's assessment for one year following the acquisition. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the SRS acquisition.\n\nThe effectiv eness of our internal control ov er financial reporting as of February 2, 2025 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\n\n## CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nWe are in the process of an ongoing business transformation initiativ e, which includes upgrading and migrating certain accounting and finance systems. We plan to continue to migrate additional business processes ov er the course of the next few years and hav e modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes as the transformation continues.\n\nExcept as described abov e, there were no other changes in our internal control ov er financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended February 2, 2025 that hav e materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control ov er financial reporting.",

On June 18, 2024, following the satisfaction or waiv er of the applicable closing conditions, including receipt of the requisite regulatory approv als, the acquisition was completed and all merger consideration was transferred. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of The Home Depot, Inc. merged with and into Shingle Acquisition Holdings, Inc., the parent company of SRS, with Shingle Acquisition Holdings, Inc. as the surv iv ing entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We believ e the acquisition of SRS will accelerate the Company's growth with the Pro. The acquisition is expected to establish the Company as a leading specialty trade distributor across multiple v erticals, complement our existing capabilities, and enable us to better serv e complex project purchase occasions with the renov ator/remodeler. We primarily used a combination of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, the issuance of long-term debt, as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisition.

Our online product offerings complement our stores by serv ing as an extended aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites and mobile applications, including homedepot.com, our primary website; homedepot.ca and homedepot.com.mx, our websites in Canada and Mexico, respectiv ely; hdsupply.com, our website for our MRO products and related serv ices; our websites for custom window cov erings including blinds.com, justblinds.com and americanblinds.com; thecompanystore.com, our website featuring textiles and d\u00e9cor products; and srsdistribution.com, heritagelandscapesupplygroup.com, and heritagepoolsupplygroup.com, our websites serv ing the roofing and building materials, landscape and pool product needs of specialty Pros, respectiv ely.\n\nWe believe our merchandising organization is a key competitiv e adv antage, deliv ering product innov ation, assortment and v alue, which reinforces our position as the product authority in home improv ement. At the same time, we remain focused on offering the right products at ev eryday v alues in our stores and online. To remain the product authority, we must continue to bring new and innov ativ e products to our customers that help simplify their projects, from the Pro's need for job-lot quantities of specialized products to DIY customers seeking products to reduce their env ironmental impacts. To help our merchandising organization keep pace with changing customer expectations and increasing desire for innov ation, localization, and personalization, we are continuing to inv est in tools to better lev erage our data and driv e a deeper lev el of collaboration with our suppliers. As a result, we continue to focus on enhanced merchandising information technology tools to help us: (1) enhance an interconnected shopping experience that remains tailored to our customers' shopping intent and location; (2) prov ide the best v alue in the market; and (3) optimize our product assortments. Our merchandising team lev erages technology and works closely with our inv entory and supply chain teams, as well as our suppliers, to manage our assortments, driv e innov ation, manage the cost env ironment, and adjust inv entory lev els to respond to fluctuations in demand.\n\nTo complement our merchandising efforts, we offer a number of serv ices for our customers, including installation serv ices for our DIY and DIFM customers, as noted abov e. We also prov ide tool and equipment rentals at locations across the U.S. and Canada, prov iding v alue and conv enience for both Pros and consumers. To improv e the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated serv ice offering, we are continuing to inv est in more tool rental locations, more tools, and better technology.\n\n## Sourcing and Quality Assurance\n\nWe maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innov ativ e products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2024, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and env ironmental responsibility, we also hav e a global responsible sourcing program. Under our standard supplier buying agreement, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. This standard agreement also requires compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cov er a v ariety of expectations, including supply chain transparency, compliance with applicable laws and regulations addressing prohibitions on child and forced labor, health and safety, env ironmental matters, compensation, and hours of work. To driv e accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement also includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct risk-based factory audits and compliance v isits with nonCanada and non-U.S. suppliers of priv ate branded and direct import products. Our 2024 Responsible Sourcing Report, av ailable on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com under 'Responsibility &gt; Sourcing Responsibly,' prov ides more information about this program.

      "question": "How does The Home Depot's inclusion of U.S. Virgin Islands locations in its total store count support its strategic objective of growing market share with Pros through geographic expansion, as reflected in both its aggregated segment reporting structure and professional customer focus?",
      "answer": "The Home Depot operates 2,347 stores as of fiscal 2024, including locations in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are specifically mentioned as part of the U.S. geographic segment (page 5). These locations contribute to the company's strategy of growing market share with Pros through geographic expansion (page 5). Despite this geographic presence, the U.S. Virgin Islands locations are included within the broader U.S. operating segment that is aggregated with the mainland U.S., Canada, and Mexico into one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes (page 55). This aggregation suggests that while the U.S. Virgin Islands locations support the strategic objective of geographic expansion and Pro customer growth, they are not considered significant enough to warrant separate financial disclosure, indicating they likely represent a smaller portion of overall operations.",

In Nov ember 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 'Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,' which is intended to improv e disclosures about a public business entity's expenses by requiring disaggregated disclosure, in the notes to the financial statements, of prescribed categories of expenses within relev ant income statement captions. ASU No. 2024-03 is effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard may be applied either on a prospectiv e or retrospectiv e basis. We are currently ev aluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements adopted or pending adoption not discussed abov e are either not applicable or are not expected to hav e a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## 2. SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company defines its segments based on how internally reported financial information is regularly rev iewed by the chief operating decision maker ('CODM'), our President and Chief Executiv e Officer, to analyze financial performance, make decisions, and allocate resources.\n\nPrimary Segment. We are engaged in the operation of retail stores and sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improv ement products, lawn and garden products, d\u00e9cor products, and facilities MRO products both in stores and online. We also prov ide a number of serv ices, including home improvement installation serv ices, and tool and equipment rental. We currently conduct these operations in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents an operating segment. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three geographic operating segments into one reportable segment (the 'Primary segment') due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics.\n\nOther. As discussed in Note 13, in June 2024, we acquired SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across sev eral v erticals serv ing the professional roofer, landscaper and pool contractor through its branches located throughout the U.S. SRS is organized as three different lines of business: roofing and complementary building products, landscape, and pool. We hav e determined that each of these three lines of business represents an operating segment, none of which meets the thresholds prescribed under Topic 280 to be deemed a reportable segment. Therefore, results from our SRS operating segments are presented in 'Other' beginning from the acquisition date of June 18, 2024.\n\nSegment Information. For our Primary segment, our CODM uses operating income to allocate resources in the planning and forecasting process and to assess segment performance by monitoring actual results v ersus prior-period, forecasted results, and the annual plan. Assets are rev iewed by our CODM on a total company consolidated basis and not by segment. The accounting policies of our Primary segment are the same as those described in our summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nThe following table presents net sales, significant expenses, and operating income for our Primary segment:\n\n",

We offer our customers a wide assortment of building materials, home improv ement products, lawn and garden products, d\u00e9cor products, and facilities MRO products, in stores and online. We also prov ide a number of serv ices, including home improv ement installation serv ices, and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2024, we operated 2,347 stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. For disclosure purposes, the geographic operating segments of the U.S., Canada and Mexico are aggregated into one reportable segment (the 'Primary segment').\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we acquired SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company engaged in the distribution of residential and commercial roofing products, complementary building products, landscape supplies and swimming pool supplies serv ing the professional roofer, landscaper, and pool contractor. At the end of fiscal 2024, SRS operated ov er 780 branch locations throughout the U.S., each of which has a distribution center, material handling and deliv ery equipment, and inv entory. SRS is organized as three different lines of business: roofing and complementary building products, landscape, and pool. Each line of business was determined to represent an operating segment, none of which are deemed reportable segments.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, when we refer to 'The Home Depot,' 'Home Depot,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us' or 'our' in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate headquarters) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770) 433-8211.\n\n## OUR BUSINESS\n\n## OUR STRATEGY\n\nThe retail landscape has changed rapidly ov er the past sev eral years, with a complex macroeconomic env ironment and customer expectations continually ev olv ing. In fiscal 2024, our strategy allowed us to continue to execute at a high lev el despite continued pressure on home improv ement demand from high interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. We continued our strategic inv estments aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds, growing our market share with Pros through our ecosystem of capabilities, and building new stores. Going forward, we will continue to lev erage the momentum of these inv estments and inv est in our business in support of the following goals:\n\n- We intend to prov ide the best customer experience in home improv ement and dev elop differentiated capabilities for our customers;\n- We intend to extend our position as the low-cost prov ider in home improv ement; and\n- We intend to be the most efficient inv estor of capital in home improv ement.\n\nWe believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliv er v alue to our shareholders. We are steadfast in our commitments to focus on our people, operate sustainably, and strengthen our communities, and we believ e being informed by other stakeholder perspectiv es will driv e shareholder v alue creation.\n\n## DELIVER SHAREHOLDER VALUE\n\nWe seek to deliv er on our objectiv e to create shareholder v alue through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles are as follows:\n\n- First, we intend to reinv est in our business to driv e growth faster than the market.\n- Second, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to pay a quarterly div idend.\n- Third, after reinv esting in our business and paying our div idend, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases.\n\n## PART I",

      "question": "How does NIKE's segment reporting and revenue recognition policy for athletic footwear align with the operational challenges and strategic investments described in the MD&A section, particularly in light of production disruptions and inventory growth in fiscal 2022?",
      "answer": "NIKE's segment reporting (page_89) shows that athletic footwear is a core component across all geographic NIKE Brand segments, contributing significantly to revenues. The revenue recognition policy (page_65) specifies that footwear sales are recognized upon transfer of control, with reserves for returns and discounts impacting reported revenues. In the MD&A (page_31), NIKE notes that production shutdowns in Vietnam and Indonesia during fiscal 2022 led to a three-month supply loss, contributing to a 23% increase in inventory levels to $8.4 billion and elevated logistics costs. This aligns with the revenue recognition framework, as higher inventory levels and delayed shipments likely affected the timing and volume of revenue realization, while the strategic shift toward NIKE Direct (42% of NIKE Brand revenues) reflects a broader effort to control distribution and mitigate supply chain volatility. The combination of segment performance, revenue accounting, and operational disruptions paints a picture of a business navigating short-term production headwinds while investing in long-term structural advantages.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across Men's, Women's and Kids', amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, were reported within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment. Refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures for information regarding the divestiture of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nEconomic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, impacted the Company's local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected the Company's ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Russian legal entities, which resulted in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $96 million recognized within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, the Company made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 62",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which is comprised of both NIKEowned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, 'must-have' products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.\n\nThrough the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we are focusing on creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale partners that share our marketplace vision. Over the last several years, as we have executed against the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we have grown our NIKE Direct business to be approximately 42% of total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022, and we have reduced the number of wholesale accounts globally. Additionally, we have aligned our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Men's, Women's and Kids' and continue to invest in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we expect will further accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we substantially completed a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up the strategic execution of the Consumer Direct Acceleration. These changes resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and during fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $294 million, which relate to employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. For fiscal 2022, we recognized an immaterial amount of related employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. We expect future annual wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 21 - Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## COVID-19 AND MARKET DYNAMICS UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the global supply chain created volatility in our fiscal 2022 business results and operations globally. Despite these challenges, we achieved record Revenues for fiscal 2022, which increased 5% compared to the prior fiscal year with gross margin expansion of 120 basis points. Our NIKE Direct business continued its momentum, growing 14% and 15% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, led by North America, APLA and EMEA, partially offset by declines in Greater China due to a COVID-19 resurgence in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 as well as marketplace dynamics. During fiscal 2022, nearly all of our owned stores remained open across North America, EMEA and APLA. In Greater China however, due to a COVID-19 resurgence, we experienced a higher level of temporary store closures, with some operating on reduced hours, as well as lower physical traffic compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the majority of NIKE Brand and Converse contract manufacturers in Vietnam and Indonesia were subject to government mandated shutdowns due to COVID-19. As a result of these closures, we lost approximately three months of production, impacting available product supply throughout fiscal 2022. Globally, nearly all of our supplier base is currently operational without restrictions and with factory production exceeding pre-closure production levels. In addition, our supply of available inventory continued to be impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as extended inventory transit times drove elevated levels of in-transit inventory. These supply chain impacts and a COVID-19 resurgence in Greater China, combined with other factors, caused Inventories to grow to $8.4 billion, an increase of 23% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\nWe also experienced elevated transportation, logistics and fulfillment costs as a result of this dynamic environment, which partially offset gross margin expansion in fiscal 2022.\n\nInventory transit times as well as logistics and fulfillment costs are expected to remain elevated. We also expect product costs to remain elevated due to higher input costs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin could be negatively impacted by increased promotional activity to sell seasonal product arriving late due to the combination of temporary factory closures at the beginning of fiscal 2022 and continued elevated transit times. To mitigate the impact across our business, our teams are continuing to leverage our operational playbook and taking actions where we can, including balancing inventory across our geographies, pricing actions and employing a seasonless approach to products. Despite these short-term dynamics, we believe our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy continues to drive our business towards our long-term financial goals.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we continued to invest in our digital transformation and brand campaigns as the world returned to sport, and we expect to maintain our multi-year investment plans in order to transform our business of the future.",

      "question": "How does Converse's business model and geographic performance contribute to Nike's overall revenue diversification strategy, particularly in light of its distinct segment reporting and licensing revenue streams?",
      "answer": "Converse contributes to Nike's revenue diversification strategy through both its distinct business model and geographic performance. As a separate reportable segment, Converse generated $2,346 million in total revenues in fiscal 2022, with $123 million coming directly from licensing revenue, indicating a meaningful non-core revenue stream that is separate from Nike's athletic footwear and apparel focus. This licensing component, which includes royalties from third-party licensees in territories where Nike does not directly operate, provides a recurring revenue base that complements Nike\u2019s more capital-intensive direct operations. Geographically, Converse saw revenue growth in North America, Western Europe, and licensee markets, increasing 7% on a currency-neutral basis, which helped offset declines in Asia. This performance across different regions enhances Nike\u2019s geographic diversification, particularly through its direct-to-consumer channel, which grew 22% driven by digital demand. Together, these factors demonstrate how Converse supports Nike's broader strategy by offering a lifestyle-oriented brand with diversified revenue sources and geographic exposure.",

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2022 due to revenue growth in North America, Western Europe and licensee markets, partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 22%, led by strong digital demand. Wholesale revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China as well as global supply chain constraints. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 6%, while ASP increased 12%, driven by growth in direct to consumer.\n\nReported EBIT increased 23%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense, while operating overhead increased primarily due to higher professional services costs.",

      "answer": "Nike's strategic shift toward NIKE Direct, which reached 42% of total NIKE Brand revenues in fiscal 2022, reflects a broader effort to control consumer experience and reduce dependency on wholesale partners. However, the company still sells to thousands of retail accounts globally and operates 72 distribution centers outside the U.S., indicating a continued reliance on a complex wholesale infrastructure. This dual approach suggests a balancing act between direct-to-consumer growth and maintaining broad market access through traditional retail accounts, despite the logistical and operational challenges associated with managing such an expansive distribution network.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which is comprised of both NIKEowned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, 'must-have' products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.\n\nThrough the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we are focusing on creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale partners that share our marketplace vision. Over the last several years, as we have executed against the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we have grown our NIKE Direct business to be approximately 42% of total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022, and we have reduced the number of wholesale accounts globally. Additionally, we have aligned our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Men's, Women's and Kids' and continue to invest in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we expect will further accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we substantially completed a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up the strategic execution of the Consumer Direct Acceleration. These changes resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and during fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $294 million, which relate to employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. For fiscal 2022, we recognized an immaterial amount of related employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. We expect future annual wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 21 - Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## COVID-19 AND MARKET DYNAMICS UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the global supply chain created volatility in our fiscal 2022 business results and operations globally. Despite these challenges, we achieved record Revenues for fiscal 2022, which increased 5% compared to the prior fiscal year with gross margin expansion of 120 basis points. Our NIKE Direct business continued its momentum, growing 14% and 15% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, led by North America, APLA and EMEA, partially offset by declines in Greater China due to a COVID-19 resurgence in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 as well as marketplace dynamics. During fiscal 2022, nearly all of our owned stores remained open across North America, EMEA and APLA. In Greater China however, due to a COVID-19 resurgence, we experienced a higher level of temporary store closures, with some operating on reduced hours, as well as lower physical traffic compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the majority of NIKE Brand and Converse contract manufacturers in Vietnam and Indonesia were subject to government mandated shutdowns due to COVID-19. As a result of these closures, we lost approximately three months of production, impacting available product supply throughout fiscal 2022. Globally, nearly all of our supplier base is currently operational without restrictions and with factory production exceeding pre-closure production levels. In addition, our supply of available inventory continued to be impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as extended inventory transit times drove elevated levels of in-transit inventory. These supply chain impacts and a COVID-19 resurgence in Greater China, combined with other factors, caused Inventories to grow to $8.4 billion, an increase of 23% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\nWe also experienced elevated transportation, logistics and fulfillment costs as a result of this dynamic environment, which partially offset gross margin expansion in fiscal 2022.\n\nInventory transit times as well as logistics and fulfillment costs are expected to remain elevated. We also expect product costs to remain elevated due to higher input costs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin could be negatively impacted by increased promotional activity to sell seasonal product arriving late due to the combination of temporary factory closures at the beginning of fiscal 2022 and continued elevated transit times. To mitigate the impact across our business, our teams are continuing to leverage our operational playbook and taking actions where we can, including balancing inventory across our geographies, pricing actions and employing a seasonless approach to products. Despite these short-term dynamics, we believe our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy continues to drive our business towards our long-term financial goals.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we continued to invest in our digital transformation and brand campaigns as the world returned to sport, and we expect to maintain our multi-year investment plans in order to transform our business of the future.",

As used in this report, the terms 'we,' 'us,' 'NIKE' and the 'Company' refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE digital commerce website is located at www.nike.com . On our NIKE corporate website, located at investors.nike.com , we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC'): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive Proxy Statements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these filings are also available on the SEC's website ( www.sec.gov ). Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this Annual Report or any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.\n\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our digital platforms. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products are manufactured both in the United States and abroad.\n\nAll references to fiscal 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are to NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Any references to other fiscal years refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year.\n\n## PRODUCTS\n\nOur NIKE Brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on Men's, Women's and Kids'. We also design products specifically for the Jordan Brand and Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities.\n\nNIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Our Men's, Women's and Jordan Brand footwear products currently lead in footwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so.\n\nWe also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Our Men's and Women's apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect them to continue to do so. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in 'collections' of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.\n\nWe sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 1",

      "answer": "The Home Depot made a significant $2.6 billion capital investment in fiscal 2021 to support an interconnected shopping experience (page 6), which aligns with its broader strategy to provide a seamless blend of digital and physical retail environments (page 10). This investment focused on enhancing digital properties, store infrastructure, and associate tools to create a frictionless customer journey. However, the company acknowledges execution risks associated with these investments, particularly around integration complexity and strategic transaction uncertainties. Specifically, the 10-K notes that strategic transactions\u2014such as mergers, acquisitions, and alliances\u2014carry risks related to integration timelines, realization of anticipated benefits, and the potential for increased complexity in financial systems, internal controls, and operations (page 18). Additionally, the company warns that investments in its interconnected shopping experience may not deliver the expected benefits, may take longer than anticipated, or could fail altogether, which could adversely impact its competitive position and financial results. Therefore, while The Home Depot is committed to enhancing the shopping experience through substantial investment, it must also navigate material execution risks that could undermine the anticipated outcomes of these strategic initiatives.",

We generally expect that these transactions will result in sales increases, cost savings, synergies, enhanced capabilities or various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our acquisitions, we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the target company's products, services, associates, and information technology, financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, technology and cybersecurity systems, and operations and make them more difficult to manage. Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional risks and liabilities. Strategic transactions may also be subject to significant regulatory uncertainty. The changing enforcement landscape may result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated outcome of a transaction. Any failure in the execution of a strategic transaction, our approach to the integration of an acquired asset or business, or achieving expected synergies or other benefits could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs.\n\nOur customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including increased market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics; the continuing impacts of the pandemic; and our reputation within the labor market. We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have faced and may",

Enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on a mobile device. Mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their digital interactions. As a result, we have made significant investments to our digital properties to improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We have also enhanced the 'shopability' of an online product by including more information on the product's landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, and a multitude of fulfillment options. Our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content, speed to checkout, and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth. It has also been critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers have gravitated even more to the digital environment.\n\nFurther, we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific transaction; rather, we believe it encompasses an entire journey from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care and support. Customers expect more personalized messaging, so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and in-store experiences to create a seamless series of engagements across channels. From the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product know-how, we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today.\n\nStore Experience. Our stores remain the hub of our business, and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout. For several years, our associates have used web-enabled handheld devices we call 'GET phones' to help expedite the online order checkout process, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. To improve the customer's experience in our stores, we have also empowered our customers with additional self-help tools, including mobile app-enabled store navigation. Our app provides store-specific maps, which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we leveraged the investments made in our stores over the past several years to operate effectively in the dynamic environment we faced throughout the year. These investments include our wayfinding sign and store refresh package in all of our U.S. stores; our self-service lockers, online order storage areas at front entrances, and curbside pickup, which offer convenient pickup options for online orders; electronic shelf label capabilities; and the re-design of the front-end area, including reconfigured service desks, improved layouts in all checkout areas, and expanded and enhanced self-checkout options. We believe these investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, and we will continue to invest to improve the customer experience going forward.\n\nInvesting in Associate Productivity. We continually strive to improve our store operations for our associates. Our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. To this end, we have continued to focus our efforts in such areas as optimizing product flow to decrease the amount of time a store associate spends locating product and to improve on-shelf product availability; creating a simpler order management system; expanding in-aisle, real-time mobile learning tools for our associates' own development and to assist with customer questions; and using labor model tools to better align associate activity with customer needs.\n\nInvesting in Safety. We are committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. We empower trained EH&amp;S associates to evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EH&amp;S policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness,",

We offer our customers a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, d\u00e9cor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products and provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we operated 2,317 stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. When we refer to 'The Home Depot,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us' or 'our' in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770) 433-8211.\n\n## Our Business\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nThe retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years, with customer expectations constantly evolving. In fiscal 2021, this trend continued due to the challenges created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the broader domestic and global business environment, including supply chain disruptions, tight labor market conditions, and inflationary pressures. To navigate this dynamic environment and meet heightened levels of home improvement demand throughout the year, we had to operate with agility while also managing evolving requirements to support customer and associate safety.\n\nOur ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers was due in significant part to our strategic investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum of these strategic investments and continue to invest in our business in support of the following goals:\n\n- We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement;\n- We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement; and\n- We intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.\n\nWe believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliver value to our shareholders. We are steadfast in this commitment, while also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed by the needs of our other stakeholders, including our customers, associates, supplier partners, and communities, creates value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\n\n## Deliver Shareholder Value\n\nWe deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles are as follows:\n\n- First, we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market.\n- Second, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We intend to increase our dividend as we grow earnings.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we invested $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support an interconnected customer experience. We also focused on driving productivity throughout the business to lower our costs. The combination of reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales and driving productivity to lower costs creates what we refer to as a virtuous cycle, which has allowed us to improve the customer experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver shareholder value.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we returned approximately $22 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We paid $7.0 billion in cash dividends and returned approximately $15.0 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases in fiscal 2021. Our capital allocation is discussed further in Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## PART I",

      "answer": "Home Depot's forward-looking statements (page 5) explicitly include HD Supply as a factor in its strategic assumptions, noting that the acquisition could influence performance metrics like net sales growth and comparable sales. In fiscal 2021, HD Supply contributed to a $19.0 billion increase in net sales (page 33), supporting the strategic assumption that the acquisition would drive growth. However, the acquisition also had a significant impact on capital allocation, as the $7.8 billion net consideration paid for HD Supply (page 37) directly affected cash flow from investing activities, indicating that the financial execution of the acquisition required substantial upfront investment. This shows that while HD Supply contributed meaningfully to sales growth, it also introduced a major capital outflow that shaped the company's liquidity and investment capacity in the short term.",

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes.\n\nCash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.3 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and was primarily driven by changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in net earnings. Working capital was impacted by higher merchandise inventories resulting from our efforts to continue to meet the demand environment and from higher product and transportation costs, along with timing of vendor payments.\n\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $7.2 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to $7.8 billion of net consideration paid to acquire HD Supply in fiscal 2020, partially offset by increased capital expenditures.\n\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8 billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt.\n\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 primarily reflected $6.5 billion of cash dividends paid, $2.9 billion of repayments of long-term debt, $974 million of net repayments of short-term debt, and $791 million for share repurchases prior to our suspension of share repurchases in March 2020, partially offset by $7.9 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.\n\n## Merchandise Inventories\n\nWe value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.",

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes.\n\nCash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.3 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and was primarily driven by changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in net earnings. Working capital was impacted by higher merchandise inventories resulting from our efforts to continue to meet the demand environment and from higher product and transportation costs, along with timing of vendor payments.\n\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $7.2 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to $7.8 billion of net consideration paid to acquire HD Supply in fiscal 2020, partially offset by increased capital expenditures.\n\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8 billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt.\n\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 primarily reflected $6.5 billion of cash dividends paid, $2.9 billion of repayments of long-term debt, $974 million of net repayments of short-term debt, and $791 million for share repurchases prior to our suspension of share repurchases in March 2020, partially offset by $7.9 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.\n\n## Merchandise Inventories\n\nWe value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.",

          "chunk_text": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors The Home Depot, Inc.:\n\n## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Estimation of store shrink\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the Company's U.S. merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first out) or market as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. The Company calculates shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring in the period between physical inventory counts and fiscal year-end as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company's estimation of shrink at the end of the fiscal year using interim inventory loss experience in U.S. retail stores involved auditor judgment.",

      "answer": "Booking.com has historically benefited from the Innovation Box Tax regime in the Netherlands, which taxed qualifying innovative activities at 9% (up from 7% pre-2021), significantly below the Dutch statutory rate of 25.8% as of 2022. This benefit has had a material positive impact on the company's effective tax rate in 2021\u20132023. However, eligibility requires Booking.com to obtain an R&D certificate every six months confirming that its activities qualify as 'innovative.' If the company fails to secure this certification in the future, it could lose the benefit, increasing its effective tax rate. Additionally, the Dutch corporate tax rate increased from 25% to 25.8% in 2022, further heightening the value of maintaining the Innovation Box Tax treatment. The uncertainty around continued eligibility, combined with global tax changes like the OECD's 15% minimum tax, creates exposure that could negatively affect future cash flows and results of operations.",

      "question": "How does Booking Holdings' classification and valuation of International Government Securities align across its short-term and long-term investments, and what does this consistency indicate about its approach to managing Level 2 fair value assets?",
      "answer": "Booking Holdings classifies International Government Securities as Level 2 assets in both short-term and long-term investment categories. On page 91, short-term International Government Securities are reported at $63 million, while on page 92, long-term International Government Securities are listed at $62 million. Page 90 provides a breakdown of carrying values, showing $13 million for short-term and $62 million for long-term International Government Securities, aligning with the Level 2 fair value measurements in the other sections. This consistency across classifications suggests that Booking Holdings maintains a stable valuation methodology for these securities, indicating disciplined management of Level 2 assets where observable market data is used without significant adjustments or uncertainties.",

      "question": "Given the increase in BKNG's money market fund investments from $10,871 million in 2022 (Level 1) to $11,483 million in 2023 (Level 1), how does the company's cash management strategy reflect a preference for liquidity and risk mitigation as described in the fair value disclosures and cash equivalent definitions?",
      "answer": "BKNG increased its Level 1 money market fund investments from $10,871 million in 2022 to $11,483 million in 2023, indicating a strategic emphasis on liquidity and minimal valuation uncertainty. The company explicitly defines money market fund investments as part of its cash equivalents, noting that their carrying value 'generally approximates fair value' due to their short-term, highly liquid nature.

      "answer": "Booking.com's restaurant reservation business through OpenTable contributes to its 'advertising and other revenues' category, which is distinct from its core travel booking metrics such as room nights and gross bookings. While room nights and gross bookings focus on travel-related services like accommodations and flights, restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not factor into these primary metrics. However, the restaurant reservation offering aligns with Booking.com's broader 'Connected Trip' strategy, which aims to provide a seamless and comprehensive travel experience by integrating services beyond accommodations, such as dining. This strategic integration suggests that while OpenTable's revenues are not part of the core travel booking metrics, they play a complementary role in enhancing the overall traveler experience and expanding the company's service ecosystem.",

      "answer": "The expansion of merchant accommodation reservation services at Booking.com drove a higher growth rate in merchant gross bookings compared to agency bookings, contributing to a 15% increase in accommodation ADRs on a constant-currency basis. This shift also led to a greater proportion of merchant revenues, which increased more than agency revenues. However, this growth came with a significant rise in merchant transaction costs\u2014$573 million in 2022\u2014due to the variable nature of these expenses tied to increased transaction volume. The business model shift toward merchant services also affected revenue percentage, reducing total revenues as a percentage of gross bookings to 14.1% in 2022 from 14.3%, partly due to investments in merchandising and a higher mix of airline ticket gross bookings. This indicates a strategic trade-off between scaling higher-margin volume and managing associated cost increases.",

      "answer": "Converse's revenue declined by 15% on a currency-neutral basis in fiscal 2024, contributing only $2,082 million to Nike's total revenues, a drop from $2,427 million in fiscal 2023. This decline was driven by reduced sales in North America and Western Europe, with both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels down 12% combined. The drop in revenue also led to a significant decline in EBIT, falling from $676 million in fiscal 2023 to $474 million. Historically, Converse has contributed a modest portion of Nike\u2019s total revenue\u2014$2,427 million out of $51,217 million in fiscal 2023\u2014and its profitability has been relatively lower compared to other segments like North America or Europe. The revenue breakdown by channel further shows that Converse's performance is heavily weighted toward footwear ($2,155 million in fiscal 2023), with much smaller contributions from apparel and equipment. This suggests that while Converse remains a recognizable brand within Nike\u2019s portfolio, its strategic role may be more about brand diversification than financial outperformance, especially as it faces challenges in key markets.",

      "question": "How does Nike's exposure to financial instability among wholesale customers affect its liquidity commitments and risk management strategy, especially in light of advance order obligations and global economic volatility?",
      "answer": "Nike faces material risk from the financial instability of its wholesale customers, as noted in the risk factors section, where bankruptcies or financial difficulties could lead to delayed or unmade payments, or order cancellations. This risk is compounded by Nike\u2019s operational model, which includes significant advance product purchase obligations\u2014$5.7 billion as of May 31, 2024\u2014based on orders from these same wholesale customers. Additionally, global economic volatility, including inflation and currency exchange fluctuations, further complicates the financial health of these customers and indirectly affects Nike\u2019s liquidity and margins. Together, these factors create a complex exposure where liquidity commitments (such as purchase obligations) are made in advance, yet collection or fulfillment success depends on the solvency and stability of wholesale partners, especially in uncertain economic conditions.",

        "Hop 3: [NKE](page_14) \u2192 [Wholesale Customers]: Economic volatility, including inflation and currency exchange fluctuations, is noted to indirectly affect customer financial health, which in turn impacts Nike\u2019s sales and receivables."

      "question": "How does Nike's foreign exchange risk management program impact both the consolidated financial results and segment-level performance, considering its centralized hedging strategy, specific hedged exposures, and the reported $588 million favorable change in foreign currency gains and losses?",
      "answer": "Nike's foreign exchange risk management program affects both consolidated financial results and segment-level performance by centrally hedging exposures such as product costs, non-functional currency revenues, and intercompany transactions. This centralized approach results in foreign currency hedge gains and losses being reported in Corporate revenues, which offset the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse. The $588 million favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses in fiscal 2024, related to the difference between actual and standard exchange rates assigned to those segments, was a key component of the decrease in Corporate loss before interest and taxes. This reflects how the program delays the impact of exchange rate movements on financial statements, with hedge results smoothing the volatility of foreign exchange exposure across both consolidated and segment reporting.",

        "Hop 1: [NKE](page_84) \u2192 [Foreign Exchange Risk Management Program]: Details how Nike hedges foreign currency exposures including product costs, non-functional currency revenues, and intercompany transactions, with changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) until affecting Net Income.",
        "Hop 2: [NKE](page_47) \u2192 [Foreign Exchange Risk Management Program]: Notes that the program is centrally managed and that fiscal 2024 saw a $588 million favorable change in foreign currency gains and losses, which significantly reduced the Corporate loss before interest and taxes.",
        "Hop 3: [NKE](page_37) \u2192 [Foreign Exchange Risk Management Program]: Explains that Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses tied to revenues from NIKE Brand geographic segments and Converse, indicating how the program affects consolidated results while segments operate under standard exchange rates."

      "question": "How does Tesla's financial performance related to resale value guarantees in 2021 reconcile with its revenue recognition policy and the impact of market value fluctuations on its sales return reserve?",
      "answer": "Tesla's financial performance in 2021 showed a $365 million net release of its sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased automotive sales revenue due to actual return rates being lower than expected and higher resale values. This aligns with Tesla's revenue recognition policy, where it recognizes revenue upon delivery but adjusts for a sales return reserve based on historical experience and estimated future market values. The company also disclosed that it assesses market values quarterly and may adjust the reserve if market conditions change, which explains the $365 million positive adjustment in 2021 when actual returns were lower and resale prices were higher than projected.",

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

          "chunk_text": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAt the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.\n\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n## Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.\n\nWe recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle's estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer's economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values.",

      "answer": "Tesla's production status of the Model S, as of the 10-K filing, indicates that the new versions of the Model S were still ramping in Q2 and Q4 of 2021, resulting in a year-over-year decline in cash deliveries by 28,819 units despite a higher average selling price. This production delay impacted automotive sales revenue, which saw a decrease in Model S and X deliveries, even as the overall automotive sales revenue increased by $19.52 billion due to strong Model 3 and Y performance. The customer deposit structure, which includes refundable payments prior to delivery, aligns with this production timing challenge, as deposits are held in current liabilities and only applied to purchase balances upon delivery, potentially affecting cash flow and revenue recognition timing for the Model S.",

Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model, the energy product and the country of delivery. With the exception of a nominal order fee, customer deposits are fully refundable on vehicles prior to delivery and fully refundable in the case of an energy generation or storage product prior to the entry into a purchase agreement or in certain cases for a limited time thereafter (in accordance with applicable laws). Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer's purchase balance.\n\n## Solar Renewable Energy Credits\n\nWe account for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates ('SRECs') when they are purchased by us or sold to third parties. For SRECs generated by solar energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs. We recognize revenue within the energy generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to energy generation and storage cost of revenue.\n\n## Nevada Tax Incentives\n\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034, depending on the incentive.

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

      "answer": "Tesla positions Megapack as a scalable energy storage solution for commercial and utility customers, designed to be grouped into large-scale installations of gigawatt hours or greater (page_5). This strategic positioning aligns with Tesla's capital expenditure plans, as the company began constructing its Megafactory in Lathrop, California, to increase production capacity for Megapack and other energy storage products, with capital expenditures projected at $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and the following two years (page_34). This investment follows strong historical revenue growth from Megapack deployments, which contributed to a $795 million, or 40%, increase in Energy Generation and Storage revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 (page_39). Together, these sections show Tesla is scaling Megapack production in response to market demand and deploying significant capital to support its role as a core component of the company's energy business.",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including beginning construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop, California, but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest, and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training new installers, as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\n\n## Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X, Megapack and Solar Roof, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years.\n\nOur business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of 'in-themoney' convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n## Operating Expense Trends\n\nAs long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded approximately $101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ('GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSince the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government regulations and shifting social behaviors have limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. In some cases, the relaxation of such trends has been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce, including in parts of the U.S., and the rest of the world.\n\nDuring 2020, we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide, and certain of our suppliers also shut down operations temporarily or permanently, including during the recently re-imposed lockdowns in certain parts of the world. We instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. Temporary impediments to administrative activities supporting our operations also hampered our product deliveries and deployments.\n\nGlobal trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have longlasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic. For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors, which has caused challenges in our supply chain and production. In addition, labor shortages resulting from the pandemic, including worker absenteeism, may lead to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and service workers, as well as increased labor costs. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances. The contingencies inherent in the construction of, and ramp at, new facilities such as Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges.\n\nWe cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\n## We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs.\n\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.\n\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles including Model 3 and Model Y, which we are planning to achieve through multiple factories worldwide. We have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y at high volumes and even less experience building and ramping vehicle production lines across multiple factories in different geographies. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China and Germany. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\n\nWe may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants such as the recently updated Model S and Model X; new vehicles such as Tesla Semi, Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence, such as new Autopilot or FSD",

      "question": "What was the overall financial impact of Tesla's adoption of the new crypto assets accounting standard on its 2024 financial statements, particularly in terms of Digital Assets, Net valuation, tax treatment, and year-over-year balance sheet changes?",
      "answer": "Tesla adopted the new crypto assets standard (ASU No. 2023-08) effective January 1, 2024, which required Digital Assets, Net to be measured at fair value with changes reported in the statement of operations. As a result, Tesla recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. By December 31, 2024, Digital Assets, Net increased by $347 million, contributing $270 million to net income attributable to common stockholders and $0.08 to both basic and diluted EPS. This change also led to a $77 million decrease in Deferred tax assets due to the tax treatment adjustments. On the balance sheet, Digital Assets, Net rose from $184 million in 2023 to $1,076 million in 2024, reflecting both the impact of the new standard and Tesla\u2019s strategic positioning in digital asset holdings.",

The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. The new crypto assets standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new crypto assets standard requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the new crypto assets standard is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the new crypto assets standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2024. Refer to Note 3, Digital Assets, Net for the inclusion of the new required disclosures. The cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2024 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the new crypto assets standard was as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Tesla categorizes Paid Supercharging as part of 'Services and Other Revenue' and includes it in the automotive segment's financial reporting. In 2024, the cost of services and other revenue increased by 27%, or $2.09 billion, driven in part by higher costs associated with Paid Supercharging. This aligns with the segment reporting, where Paid Supercharging is embedded within the automotive segment\u2019s broader services revenue and cost structure, indicating that its financial performance directly impacts the segment's gross margin. This integrated treatment shows that Tesla views Paid Supercharging as a strategic component of its automotive ecosystem, despite its cost implications.",

          "chunk_text": "## Automotive Leasing Revenue\n\n## Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\n\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers may opt to return the vehicles to us or purchase the vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.78 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.75 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $394 million and $458 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\n\nOur policy is to ex clude tax es collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n## Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program\n\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases ('ASC 842'), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $12 million, $215 million and $683 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $7 million, $164 million and $427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\n\n## Services and Other Revenue\n\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\n\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Sales\n\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small-scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.",

The decreases were partially offset by higher costs for Cybertruck.\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $265 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries and a decrease in our direct operating lease cost of revenue driven by lower lease buyouts compared to the prior periods.\n\nCost of services and other revenue increased $2.09 billion, or 27%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to volume increases in used vehicle sales at lower average vehicle acquisition cost, insurance services, paid Supercharging, part sales and non-warranty maintenance services and collision.\n\nGross margin for total automotive decreased from 19.4% to 18.4% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to lower average selling price on our vehicles and Cybertruck ramp, partially offset by lower average combined cost per unit of our vehicles and increases in regulatory credit and FSD (Supervised) revenue, as discussed above.\n\nGross margin for total automotive &amp; services and other segment decreased from 18.2% to 16.9% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## 2024 compared to 2023\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $2.55 billion, or 52%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in Megapack and Powerwall deployments, partially offset by increases in IRA manufacturing credits recognized as compared to the prior year.",

While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.\n\n## Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.\n\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.\n\n## We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nWe provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.\n\n## If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, or in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nCertain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.\n\n## Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and certain of our debt facilities could impair a takeover attempt.\n\nOur certificate of formation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 21.606 of the Texas Business Organizations Code and other provisions of Texas law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, a change in control may cause the acceleration of certain of our debt facilities. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\n\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the first quarter of 2024, we ex perienced a sequential decline in production volumes partially caused by the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack. In the first quarter of 2025, as we launch our New Model Y worldwide, we may similarly experience delays or declines in production volumes due to simultaneous manufacturing ramps in facilities on three continents. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\n\n## Automotive-Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\n\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles' affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles' performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and delivering new vehicles and vehicle options, such as our launch of the updated Model 3 in 2024, and the New Model Y in the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.",

We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\n\n## Solar Energy Systems\n\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (E SG) and Human Capital Resources\n\n## ESG\n\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\n\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our incidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling, impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.",

      "question": "Given GM's forward-looking statements about the importance of full-size ICE vehicles, their financial performance showing increased sales of full-size pickup trucks, and the strategic emphasis on transitioning to EVs, how does the company reconcile its near-term profitability dependence on full-size ICE pickup trucks with its long-term EV-focused strategy, especially in light of potential shifts in consumer preferences and fuel prices?",
      "answer": "GM's forward-looking statements (page 51) identify the success of its current line of ICE vehicles, particularly full-size SUVs and pickup trucks, as critical to near-term profitability. Financial results (page 35) show increased net wholesale volumes driven by strong sales of full-size pickup trucks, which also positively impacted revenue mix. However, in the strategic overview (page 17), GM emphasizes its long-term transition to an all-electric future, with profitability increasingly dependent on EV adoption. The company acknowledges the tension between these priorities, noting that near-term profitability from ICE vehicles funds growth in EVs and AVs, but also highlights the risk that shifts in consumer preferences or fuel prices could weaken demand for its high-margin ICE vehicles. This creates a strategic balancing act between sustaining ICE vehicle sales and investing in EV infrastructure and innovation.",

      "question": "Given GM's $10.0 billion accelerated share repurchase program in December 2023, their strategic emphasis on software-enabled services like OnStar and Super Cruise with over 400,000 miles of compatible roads in North America, and their consolidated financial presentation that defers revenue for future software services, how does this combination of capital deployment, product innovation, and revenue recognition timing reflect GM's prioritization of shareholder returns versus long-term investment in software-defined vehicle capabilities over the next 3\u20135 years?",
      "answer": "GM's $10.0 billion ASR program executed in December 2023 demonstrates a strong near-term commitment to shareholder returns, particularly following a $2.0 billion cost-reduction initiative announced in January 2023. However, this capital deployment contrasts with their strategic emphasis on software-enabled services, including the expansion of OnStar across 15 global markets and the rollout of Super Cruise on over 400,000 miles of compatible roads in the U.S. and Canada. The consolidated financial statements show that a portion of vehicle revenue is deferred for future software services, indicating long-term monetization potential but delayed financial impact. This suggests GM is balancing immediate shareholder returns through aggressive repurchases with long-term investment in software-defined capabilities that may not fully materialize financially for several years, potentially signaling a dual focus on short-term capital discipline and long-term transformation.",

      "question": "How does Booking.com's increased investment in merchant transaction costs relate to its operating margin pressures, and what role does the ongoing Swiss regulatory investigation play in constraining its ability to mitigate these financial impacts?",
      "answer": "Booking.com's increased merchant transaction costs by $215 million in 2021, as travel demand rebounded and the company expanded its merchant accommodation reservation services, directly contributed to operating margin pressure. This financial impact is compounded by the ongoing Swiss Price Surveillance Office investigation into Booking.com's commission levels, which could result in Booking.com being required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland if the investigation concludes adversely. Since merchant-based transactions result in higher expenses (such as payment processing and chargebacks) recorded under 'Sales and other expenses' and 'Personnel', and are only partially offset by incremental revenues like credit card rebates, any regulatory-imposed constraints on commission rates would limit Booking.com's ability to offset these rising costs, thereby exacerbating margin pressure.",

          "chunk_text": "making certain adjustments to how discounts and statements concerning popularity or availability are shown to consumers. To the extent that these or any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nAs markets evolve and NCAs or other governmental authorities continue to monitor our industry, new investigations of the industry generally or of us specifically could and have occurred, including revisiting issues that were the subject of prior investigations. While we believe that we are complying with our commitments, investigating authorities or third parties may determine that we are not complying with the commitments we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedies. Further, in September 2017 the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland and the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland. We are cooperating with regulators where applicable, but we are unable to predict what, if any, effect any investigations or resolutions thereof, including the effect of any commitments we might make, will have on our business, industry practices, or online commerce more generally.\n\nTo the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on us or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding competition and/or consumer law investigations could adversely affect our brands and therefore our business, market share, and results of operations. Competition and consumer law-related investigations, legislation, or issues have and could in the future result in private litigation.\n\nAnother area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restrictions where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search terms related to the other party (e.g., such other party's name). Although we are generally moving away from these types of agreements, in some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to bidding restrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contracts, it could negatively impact our performance marketing efficiency, business, and results of operations.\n\nThere is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger. In some instances, countries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities than actions taken by NCAs or other regulatory authorities. France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety and, last year, a German court ruled that our narrow parity clauses are not permitted. Additionally, the EU's Platform to Business Regulation regulates the relationship between online platforms such as Booking.com and European business users of online platforms. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be \"gatekeepers.\" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not entirely known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to presume that we are a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act as currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption, we would be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For example, the rules applicable to gatekeepers could impose limitations on data collection and usage across services or with third parties, as well as on bundling services, and could require gatekeepers to share certain customer information with partners. Wide and possibly any type of parity clauses could be prohibited for gatekeeper platforms. Additionally, in July 2021 President Biden of the United States signed an executive order aimed at restricting anticompetitive practices, including those within the technology industry. Any rules or regulations that result from this executive order, as well as any other new laws and regulations and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our services, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise cause us to incur additional operating costs to comply with or address these developments. Further, as market conditions change as a result of investigations, litigation, legislation, or political or social pressure, we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practices beyond what is required, the full effects of which may not be known when making the decision, but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWith additional attention on the size of travel or technology companies generally, our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, our ability to expand into complementary businesses or our latitude in dealing with travel service providers (such as by limiting our ability to provide discounts, rebates, or incentives or to exercise contractual rights), any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or ability to grow and compete.",

As part of these ongoing efforts, we have a long-term strategy to build a more integrated offering of multiple elements of travel connected by a payment platform, which we refer to as the \"Connected Trip,\" and we expect these efforts to increase room night growth and revenue growth over time. We may see a negative impact on our operating margins in the near term as we incur the expenses associated with Connected Trip-related investments. Further, to the extent our non-accommodation services (e.g., airline ticket reservation services) have lower margins and grow faster than our accommodation services, whether as part of the Connected Trip or otherwise, our operating margins may be negatively affected. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes. \"\n\nAs part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com, and enable our long-term Connected Trip strategy, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis, where it facilitates payments from travelers for the services provided. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that adding these types of service offerings will benefit consumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night, and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for personnel, payment processing, chargebacks (including those related to fraud), and other expenses related to these transactions, which are recorded in \"Personnel\" and \"Sales and other expenses\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as associated incremental revenues (e.g., credit card rebates), which are recorded in \"Merchant revenues.\" To the extent more of our business is generated on a merchant basis, we incur a greater level of these merchant-related expenses, which negatively impacts our operating margins despite increases in associated incremental revenues.\n\nWe have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Our marketing expenses, which are comprised of performance marketing and brand marketing expenses, declined significantly as a result of the negative impact on travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, our marketing expense increased significantly versus 2020 as a result of the improving demand environment and our own efforts to invest in marketing, but remained below 2019 levels. Our performance marketing expense, which represents a substantial majority of our marketing expense, is primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services, and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our platforms. Our brand marketing expense is primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook), online display advertising, and other brand marketing. Total marketing expenses were $3.8 billion, $2.2 billion, and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\nMarketing efficiency, expressed as marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings, and performance marketing returns on investment (\"ROIs\") are impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and are in some cases outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers, and the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns. Marketing efficiency can also be impacted by the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. In 2021, the share of room nights booked by consumers coming directly to our platforms increased as compared to 2020 and 2019, which benefits marketing efficiency.\n\nIn recent years, we observed periods of stable or increasing ROIs. In 2021, ROIs were about in line with 2019 levels and increased versus 2020 when ROIs were negatively impacted by a significant increase in cancellation rates early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect volatility in our ROIs as the pandemic continues to affect travel, and that ROIs could be negatively impacted in the future by increased levels of competition and other factors. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we typically consider several factors for each channel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incremental traffic we receive, and the anticipated repeat rate from a particular platform. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our platforms and grow our business. \" and \" Our business could be negatively affected by changes in online search and meta-search algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements. \"\n\nHistorically, our growth has primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of our most significant brand, Booking.com, due in part to the availability of a large number of properties through Booking.com.

Booking.com categorizes properties listed on its website as either (a) hotels, motels, and resorts, which groups together more traditional accommodation types (including hostels and inns), or (b) homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay, also referred to as alternative accommodations, which encompasses all other types of accommodations, including bed and breakfasts, villas, apart-hotels, and beyond.

However, this initiative faces near-term financial pressures, as increased merchant-based transactions\u2014integral to the Connected Trip\u2014result in higher expenses related to payment processing, chargebacks, and personnel, negatively impacting operating margins (page 50). Additionally, the company acknowledges significant risks around the technical development of the Connected Trip, including the integration of flight, accommodation, and other travel verticals, data compliance challenges, and potential regulatory restrictions, all of which could delay implementation or reduce the expected ROI (page 22).

          "chunk_text": "which have shown volatility and long-term deceleration of growth rates, may also impact growth rates for marketing channels. Any deterioration in our marketing efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, whether through reduced revenues or revenue growth, or through marketing expenses increasing faster than revenues, which would reduce margins and earnings growth.\n\nMany factors could cause consumers to increase their shopping activity before making a travel purchase. Increased shopping activity impedes our marketing efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes less likely to result in a reservation through our platforms, and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid marketing channels than through direct channels. Further, consumers may favor travel services offered by search or meta-search companies over OTCs, which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation platforms, increase consumer awareness of our competitors' brands and platforms, increase our marketing and other customer acquisition costs, and adversely affect our business, margins, and results of operations. To the extent any such increased shopping behavior leads to growth in our KAYAK meta-search business, such growth may not result in sufficient increases in revenues from our KAYAK meta-search business to offset any related decrease in revenues or increase in marketing and other customer acquisition costs experienced by our OTC brands.\n\nWe may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes.\n\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new service announcements, introductions and enhancements, and changing consumer demands and preferences. These characteristics are changing at an even greater pace as OTCs and travel service providers seek to address consumer needs and preferences resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes. In addition, these market characteristics are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various markets, including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geographies and the growth of the use of smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices for mobile e-commerce transactions. New developments in other areas such as cloud computing could make entering our markets easier for competitors due to lower upfront technology costs. It is increasingly important for us to effectively offer our services on mobile devices through mobile apps and mobile-optimized websites and to tailor our services to varying devices and platforms. See below Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates challenges and may enable device companies such as Google and Apple to compete directly with us .\" Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services and online platforms to evolving industry standards and local preferences, and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our services and online platforms in response to competitive service offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, our ability to achieve our long-term strategy to build the Connected Trip depends on successfully integrating and developing new and evolving technologies, which will require increased financial and personnel investments that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations until we achieve the expected return on these investments. While we believe that we have the ability to achieve our long-term strategy to build the Connected Trip, the development of the Connected Trip is subject to uncertainties, including further technical development of the flight, accommodation, and other verticals necessary for the Connected Trip experience, the ability to collect, store, and use customer data in a compliant and integrated fashion, and the attraction and retention of employees dedicated to this development effort. As a result, it may take longer than we expect to build the Connected Trip or it may not achieve the expected return on investment. Consumer demand for the Connected Trip may also not be sustained at the levels that we anticipate. These efforts may also not be successful in improving the travel experience or retaining and attracting new customers. Further, regulatory authorities may subject us to existing or new rules or restrictions that could prevent us from successfully commercializing the Connected Trip or expose us to unanticipated claims or liabilities. With any technical innovation such as the Connected Trip effort, there could be bugs, vulnerabilities and other system failures, which could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints and other adverse consequences, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWe are working toward enhancing our payments capabilities, including by offering alternative payment solutions to consumers even when those payment solutions may not be accepted by the travel service provider or restaurant. Alternate payment providers such as Alipay, Paytm, and WeChat Pay operate closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both consumers and merchants. In many markets, particularly in Asia where credit cards are not readily available and/or e-commerce is largely carried out through mobile devices, these and other emerging alternative payment methods are the exclusive or preferred means of payment for many consumers. If we are unable to offer consumers their preferred method of payment by integrating new or emerging payment methods into our platforms, we may not be able to effectively offer our services to these consumers, which would limit our growth opportunities in these markets and our business and results of operations could be harmed.",

Although new variants of COVID-19 continue to make the shape and timing of recovery uncertain, we believe the global online travel and dining industries will gradually return to pre-pandemic levels and consumer purchasing will continue to shift from traditional offline to online channels. As travel demand returns, we expect to benefit from this online growth by expanding our service offerings and markets. In particular, we seek to (a) leverage technology to provide consumers with the best experience, (b) partner with travel service providers and restaurants to our mutual benefit, (c) operate multiple brands that collaborate with each other, and (d) invest in profitable and sustainable growth.\n\n- Provide the best consumer experience. Offering consumers an outstanding online experience is essential to our success. We focus on providing consumers with: (a) intuitive, easy-to-use online travel and restaurant reservation and search services; (b) a comprehensive selection of accommodations, other travel offerings, restaurants and payment options; (c) informative and useful content, such as pictures, accommodation and restaurant details, reviews, and sustainability information; and (d) excellent customer service. Our goal is to make travel easy, frictionless, and personal and to offer consumers the most value, the most trusted brands, the most personalized experience, and the most extensive, varied, and comprehensive travel service selection in every geography. We believe that our continued work to build out our payments capabilities across the Company helps to remove some of the friction in the booking process and enables us to offer additional value for travelers. Further, we endeavor to provide excellent customer service in a variety of ways, including through call centers and online platforms and the use of chatbots and other technologies, so that consumers can be confident that booking reservations through us will be a positive experience.\n\nAlthough the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted in 2021, we continue to innovate and invest in our services in order to emerge from the pandemic in a strong position to meet the needs of consumers and partners. We seek to grow our business through innovation by providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms (i.e., websites and mobile apps) and building stronger relationships with our customers and partners. As a result, we continue to execute against our long-term strategy to build a seamless offering of multiple elements of travel, which we refer to as the \"Connected Trip.\" We believe that through innovation and the utilization of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Connected Trip will simplify and improve all aspects of the travel experience, including discovery, planning, booking, paying, coordinating itineraries among travel service providers, and automatic rescheduling. For example, if a traveler's flight is delayed, we envision that ultimately the Connected Trip will not only alert the traveler, but also automatically arrange for a late arrival at the hotel, change a dinner reservation and alert companion diners, reschedule the car arranged for airport transfer, find a later connecting flight, offer one-click rebooking and payment for any other changes, and manage other impacts from the delayed flight. We believe offering travelers a compelling flight product alongside our other travel products is a key component of our Connected Trip vision. In 2021, we made progress in building out a flight offering at Booking.com, including expanding into 34 countries by the end of the year. We expect that these developments will benefit our travelers, travel service providers, and restaurant partners, as well as provide a compelling and differentiated service offering that will drive enhanced loyalty and frequency over time.\n\n- Partner with travel service providers and restaurants. We aim to establish mutually beneficial relationships with travel service providers and restaurants around the world. We believe that travel service providers and restaurants benefit from participating in our services by increasing their distribution channels, demand, profile and reputation, and inventory utilization in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Travel service providers and restaurants benefit from our trusted brands and marketing efforts, expertise in offering an excellent consumer experience, and ability to offer their inventory in markets and to consumers that they may otherwise be unable or unlikely to reach, for instance due to language or payments services we are able to offer on their behalf.\n- Operate multiple brands. We operate multiple brands, which allows us to offer our services in ways that appeal to different consumers, pursue distinct marketing and business strategies, encourage experimentation and",

      "answer": "Booking.com's revenue model is heavily dependent on travel service providers, with commissions forming the core of its agency revenue, particularly from accommodation reservations. The company acknowledges that a full recovery from the pandemic will depend on widespread consumer confidence and the ability of these partners to meet demand, which may lag behind broader economic improvements. Additionally, during business integrations, there is a risk of losing travel service providers, which could further disrupt revenue. Compounding these challenges, the company faces cybersecurity risks, including vulnerabilities in third-party systems used by travel service providers such as GDSs and payment processors, which could lead to data breaches, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.

          "chunk_text": "variants of COVID-19 has caused uncertainty as to when restrictions will be lifted, if additional restrictions may be initiated or reimposed, if there will be permanent changes to travel behavior patterns, and the timing of distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical interventions globally.\n\nIn 2021, many countries experienced spikes in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of variants of COVID-19. We believe that as vaccines and other medical interventions that prevent or reduce the impact of COVID-19 become widespread globally, people will increasingly feel it is safe to travel again and government restrictions will be relaxed, although the timing remains uncertain.\n\nOur business is dependent on the availability of a large number of accommodations (particularly independently-owned accommodations) and restaurants, and on the ability of consumers to travel to such accommodations and restaurants on airlines, railways, and rental cars. The ability of consumers to travel across international borders has been significantly impacted by the various travel restrictions between countries. We do not expect economic and operating conditions for our business to recover fully until there is widespread consumer confidence and ability to travel, and our travel service provider and restaurant partners are able to meet the demand for services. This may not occur until well after the broader global economy begins to improve. Additionally, our business is also dependent on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending patterns. Any increased unemployment is likely to have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending, including for the travel and restaurant industries. Even though we have seen some improvements in the economic and operating conditions for our business since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole. If the travel and restaurant industries are fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are detrimental to our operating model, our business may continue to be adversely affected even as the broader global economy recovers.\n\nOur financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government restrictions resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and a significant decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes to our accommodation room nights trends. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Trends. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. These include, but are not limited to, the severity, extent, and duration of the global pandemic, including as a result of any new variants of COVID-19 and any resurgences of the pandemic; availability and efficacy of vaccines and other medical interventions to prevent or alleviate COVID-19, and their impacts on the travel and restaurant industries and consumer spending more broadly; actions taken by national, state, and local governments to contain the disease or treat its impact; the impact on attrition, as well as the changes in hiring levels and remote working arrangements that we have implemented on our operations, including the health and productivity of management and our employees, and our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls; the impact on our contracts and relationships with our partners; our ability to withstand increased cyberattacks; the speed and extent of the recovery across the broader travel ecosystem; and the duration, timing, and severity of the impact on customer spending, including how long it takes to recover from the economic recession resulting from the pandemic. The effects of the pandemic may continue to fluctuate throughout the world, which could continue to affect our business. Also, restrictions in affected regions could be extended after the virus has been contained in order to avoid relapses and there may be restrictions on certain travel activity related to whether travelers have been vaccinated. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial performance, it may also heighten many of the other risks identified in this section.\n\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or hire, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed.\n\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, including key senior management in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We may not be able to retain the services of members of our senior management or other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position. We had approximately 20,300 employees worldwide at December 31, 2021. Our future success and ability to innovate and develop products, services, technologies, and enhancements depends on our continuing to identify, attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees across our organization, and changes in our workforce may make that more difficult. In addition, our customer service resources and outsource arrangements for customer support may be unable to provide adequate customer service support, particularly during peak periods. As a result of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for a long recovery period for the travel industry, it is possible our employees may not view employment with us as positively as they did prior to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will have a long-term effect on how and from where people work, the attractiveness of our office environments, and remote working policies, and there may continue to be operational and workplace cultural challenges that may adversely affect our business, including talent retention, in the",

Integrations are complex, often involve additional or unexpected costs, and create a variety of issues and risks, including:\n\n- disruption or harm to the businesses involved;\n- disruption to our other businesses, including as a result of the need for management to spend time and attention on the integration;\n- difficulty combining different company cultures, systems, reporting structures, titles, job descriptions, and compensation schemes;\n- problems retaining key personnel, in particular at the acquired or integrated company;\n- loss of travel service providers, restaurants, or partners of the acquired business; and\n- difficulty implementing and maintaining effective controls, procedures, and policies.\n\nWe may not successfully integrate companies or achieve the strategic, financial, or operating objectives of the acquisition or integration, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or value of our acquisitions.\n\n## Information Security, Cybersecurity, and Data Privacy Risks\n\nOur processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal data exposes us to risks of internal or external security breaches and could give rise to liabilities and/or damage our reputation.\n\nWe are an innovative technology company dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure. If cyber-criminals or other threat actors are able to circumvent our security controls and capabilities, including as a result of our own acts or omissions, it could result in a compromise or breach of consumer data. In e-commerce, data security is essential to maintaining consumer and partner confidence in our services. Consumers who use certain of our services provide us with their personal identity data and payment information, which in turn attracts attention from threat actors and fraudsters. Cyberattacks by various threat actors including cyber-criminals, hackers, and state-sponsored organizations are increasing in frequency and sophistication and are constantly evolving. We face sophisticated, highly resourceful and determined adversaries and may not be able to defend against a persistent, sophisticated cyberattack from such an adversary. In addition, our security policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the continuous innovation of our offerings.\n\nVulnerabilities in our consumer and partner account security and workflow practices may result in unauthorized access to confidential data. These risks are likely to increase as we expand our offerings, integrate our products and services, and store and process more data, including personal information and payment data. Our efforts to protect information from unauthorized access may result in the rejection of legitimate attempts to book reservations through our services, which could result in lost business. We expend significant resources to protect against security breaches, and regularly increase our security-related expenditures to maintain or increase our systems' security. We have experienced and responded to cyberattacks, which we believe have not had a significant impact on the integrity of our systems or the security of data, including personal information maintained by us. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, or cause consumers to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the services of our competitors, any of which would have an adverse effect on our brands, market share, results of operations, and financial condition. See risks relating to cyberattacks in the risk below in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors -\" Cyberattacks and system vulnerabilities could lead to service outages, data loss, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position .\" Additionally, our consumers' personal data could be affected by security breaches at third parties upon which we rely, such as travel service providers, connectivity partners, payroll providers, health plan providers, payment processors, data exchange services (for example, XML Providers), or GDSs. See below Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors -\" Our business relies on a global supply chain of third party services providers and we are exposed to risks because we rely on the resilience, security, and legal compliance of their product and services .\"\n\nIn the operation of our business, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data and payment information. This data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") imposes significant compliance obligations and costs on us. Under the GDPR, violations could result in fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater. Several data protection authorities have imposed significant fines on companies of various sizes",

          "chunk_text": "## Non-derivative Instrument Designated as Net Investment Hedge\n\nThe foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Company's Euro-denominated debt are measured based upon changes in spot rates. The foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recorded in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument are recognized in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Notes 12 and 14 for further information related to the net investment hedge.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Online travel reservation services\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which principally allows travelers to book travel reservations with travel service providers through the Company's platforms. While the Company generally refers to a consumer that books travel reservation services on the Company's platforms as its customer, for accounting purposes, the Company's customers are the travel service providers and, in certain merchant transactions, the travelers. The Company's contracts with travel service providers give them the ability to market their reservation availability without transferring responsibility to deliver the travel service to the Company. Therefore, the Company's revenues are presented on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These contracts include payment terms and establish the consideration to which the Company is entitled, which includes either a commission or a margin on the travel transaction. Revenue is measured based on the expected consideration specified in the contract with the travel service provider, considering the effects of sales incentives, \"no show\" cancellations (where the traveler has not cancelled the reservation but does not arrive on the scheduled reservation date) and \"late\" cancellations (where the travel service provider accepts a cancellation after its cancellation cut-off date). Estimates for cancellations and sales incentives are based on historical experience and current trends. Coupons are recorded as a reduction of the transaction price, generally at the time they are redeemed. The local occupancy taxes, general excise taxes, value-added taxes, sales taxes, and other similar taxes (\"travel transaction taxes\"), if any, collected from travelers are reported on a net basis in revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nRevenues for online travel reservation services are recognized at a point in time when the Company has completed its post-booking services and the travelers begin using the arranged travel services. These services are classified into two categories:\n\n- Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where the Company does not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided. The Company invoices the travel service providers for its commissions in the month that travel is completed. Agency revenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions from the Company's accommodation, rental car, and airline reservation services. Substantially all of the Company's agency revenue is from Booking.com agency accommodation reservations.\n- Merchant revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where the Company facilitates payments from travelers for the services provided, generally at the time of booking. Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where travelers book accommodation, rental car, and airline reservations. The Company records cash collected from travelers, which includes the amounts owed to the travel service providers and the Company's commission or margin and fees, as deferred merchant bookings until the arranged travel service begins. Merchant revenues include travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with the Company's merchant reservations services; credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees; and ancillary fees, including travel-related insurance revenues.\n\n## Advertising and Other Revenues\n\nAdvertising and other revenues are primarily recognized by KAYAK and OpenTable. KAYAK recognizes advertising revenue primarily by sending referrals to online travel companies (\"OTCs\") and travel service providers and from advertising placements on its platforms. Revenue related to referrals is recognized when a consumer clicks on a referral placement or upon completion of the travel. Revenue for advertising placements is recognized based upon when a consumer clicks on an advertisement or when KAYAK displays an advertisement. OpenTable recognizes revenues for reservation fees when diners are seated through its online restaurant reservation service and subscription fees for restaurant management services on a straight-line basis over the contractual period in accordance with how the service is provided.",

      "question": "How does The Home Depot's reliance on the retail inventory method for valuing the majority of its inventory, combined with its estimation of store shrink and audit scrutiny, affect the reliability of its reported inventory balances and cost of sales figures?",
      "answer": "The Home Depot values the majority of its inventory using the retail inventory method (RIM), which approximates the lower of cost or market based on markups, markdowns, and shrink. Shrink is calculated using both actual physical inventory counts and interim estimates based on recent store-specific results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate would have increased fiscal 2023 cost of sales by approximately $104 million, highlighting the sensitivity of inventory estimates to financial reporting. The company\u2019s auditor identified the estimation of store shrink as a critical audit matter, emphasizing the complexity and judgment involved in estimating shrink at year-end using interim data. While the company states that historical differences between estimated and actual shrink have not been material, the audit scrutiny underscores that inventory valuation under RIM involves significant assumptions that could affect the reliability of reported inventory balances and cost of sales if misestimated.",

      "question": "How does The Home Depot's inclusion of the U.S. Virgin Islands in its geographic footprint align with its store count reporting and consolidated financial statement disclosures regarding operations in U.S. territories?",
      "answer": "The Home Depot's business overview on page 5 states that it operates in the U.S., including the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. This aligns with the store count data on page 28, which explicitly lists 2 stores in the U.S. Virgin Islands, confirming its active presence in the territory. The financial statement disclosures on page 47 further reinforce this by stating that the consolidated financial statements include operations in the U.S., which specifically encompasses the U.S. Virgin Islands. This indicates that the financial performance of the 2 stores in the U.S. Virgin Islands is fully consolidated into the company's overall financial results, treated consistently with other U.S. locations rather than being reported separately or excluded.",
