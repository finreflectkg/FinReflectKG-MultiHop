      "answer": "The 2020 Stock Incentive Plan plays a central role in UnitedHealth Group's executive compensation strategy, with 53 million shares available for future grants as of December 31, 2023. The plan supports a variety of award types, including restricted stock units, nonqualified stock options, and performance-based restricted stock units, as evidenced by the multiple award agreements listed for executives under the plan, including versions tailored for Witty and Bondy. The plan itself was formally adopted through incorporation by reference in the company's corporate governance filings, specifically under Exhibit *10.1 in the 2023 10-K filing, which links to the original S-8 registration filed on June 1, 2020. Together, these elements show a structured and formalized approach to executive incentives tied to equity performance.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group reported an increase in Medicare Advantage membership from 7,105 thousand in 2022 to 7,695 thousand in 2023 (page 30), indicating strong growth in this segment. This growth contributed to increased revenues, which were also driven by CMS risk adjustment mechanisms and pricing trends (page 29). The company recognizes Medicare Advantage premium revenues net of projected rebates and adjusts for CMS risk adjustment payments based on diagnosis and encounter data submitted by providers, which introduces complexity and regulatory scrutiny into revenue estimation and recognition (page 45). Together, these perspectives show that while Medicare Advantage is a growing and strategically important product, its financial performance is closely tied to regulatory frameworks and accounting estimates that require careful management and oversight.",

      "question": "How does UnitedHealth Group's regulatory exposure under HIPAA intersect with its Medicaid and Medicare operations, and what broader compliance risks does this create across its government-contracted health services?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's operations are subject to HIPAA regulations that govern the privacy, security, and data standards for protected health information, particularly in its Medicare and Medicaid businesses. As of December 31, 2023, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement accounted for 40% of UnitedHealth Group's total consolidated revenues, highlighting the scale of its federally regulated health services. The company must comply with HIPAA's administrative simplification provisions, including electronic transaction standards, privacy rules, and security rules, which apply to both group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded plans. Additionally, the company is subject to HITECH Act requirements, which extend HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security provisions to business associates, impose data breach notification obligations, and increase penalties for HIPAA violations. These regulatory obligations are further complicated by state privacy and security laws, which may impose more stringent requirements than federal standards. In the Risk Factors section, the company acknowledges that evolving interpretations and enforcement of federal and state laws, including HIPAA, could require changes to business practices, increase administrative costs, and expose the company to liability. Given the size of its Medicaid and Medicare operations and the complexity of HIPAA compliance across multiple regulatory jurisdictions, UnitedHealth Group faces significant compliance risks that could materially affect its operations and financial performance.",

        "Hop 2: [UNH](page_8) \u2192 [HIPAA]: The company must also comply with the HITECH Act, which extends HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security provisions to business associates, imposes federal data breach notification requirements, and increases penalties for HIPAA violations. UnitedHealth Group may act as either a covered entity or a business associate depending on the context of its operations.",

This regulatory uncertainty is compounded by the company's broad exposure through government-contracted health services."

      "question": "How does Pfizer's regulatory exposure and compliance burden for biopharmaceutical products intersect with its strategic priorities for R&D productivity and revenue growth, particularly in light of its dependence on biosimilars and the evolving intellectual property landscape?",
      "answer": "Pfizer faces a complex regulatory environment for its biopharmaceutical products, including FDA oversight of safety, efficacy, and post-marketing commitments, which creates operational and compliance costs (page_17). Despite these regulatory challenges, the company emphasizes advancing its pipeline and maximizing the value of existing products as part of its 2025 strategic priorities, particularly focusing on improving R&D productivity and achieving commercial excellence (page_34). However, the company also faces risks related to intellectual property, including potential invalidation of patents and challenges from biosimilars, which could threaten revenue stability and long-term growth if exclusivity periods expire or are contested (page_9). Therefore, Pfizer must balance regulatory compliance costs, biosimilar competition, and IP risk mitigation while driving R&D innovation and operational efficiency to sustain revenue growth.",

T he F D A, pursuant to the F F D C A, the P ublic H ealth Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, extensively regulates pre- and postmarketing activities related to our biopharm aceutical products and devices. T he statutes and regulations govern areas such as safety and efficacy, clinical trials, advertising and prom otion, quality control, m anufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-m arketing safety surveillance and reporting, and record keeping. O ther U .S. federal agencies, including the D E A, may also regulate certain of our products and activities.\n\nFor a biopharm aceutical com pany to m arket a drug or a biologic product, including vaccines, the F D A m ust evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use. Absent statutory exclusivity for a com peting product, if the F D A determ ines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective, the F D A generally will approve the product's N D A or BLA (or supplem ental N D A or supplem ental BLA), as appropriate.\n\nA drug or biologic m ay be subject to post m arketing com m itm ents, which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct, or post m arketing requirem ents, which are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and com ply with cG M P s (the F D A regulations that govern all aspects of m anufacturing quality for pharm aceuticals) and the D rug Supply C hain Security Act (the law that, am ong other things, sets forth requirem ents related to product tracing, product identifiers and verification for m anufacturers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, re-packagers and dispensers to facilitate the tracing of product through the pharm aceutical distribution supply chain), as well as advertising and prom otion regulations. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Development, Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products and Post-Authorization/Approval Data sections.\n\nWe are also responsible for m onitoring, reviewing, and the periodic reporting of adverse drug experience, or pharm acovigilance, including inform ation received from  any source, such as com m ercial m arketing experience, postm arketing clinical investigations, postm arketing epidem iological or surveillance studies, reports in the scientific literature, and unpublished scientific papers.\n\nI n the context of public health em ergencies, like the C O VID -19 pandem ic, we m ay apply to the F D A for an E U A which, if granted, allows for the distribution and use of our products during the declared em ergency, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the E U A, unless the E U A is term inated by the governm ent. Although the criteria for an E U A differ from the criteria for approval of an N D A or BLA, E U As nevertheless require the developm ent and subm ission of data to satisfy the relevant F D A standards, and a num ber of ongoing obligations. T he F D A generally expects E U A holders to work toward subm ission of full applications, such as a BLA or an N D A, as soon as possible.\n\nBiosimilar Regulation. The FD A is responsible for approval of biosim ilars. Innovator biologics, or reference products, are entitled to certain exclusivity periods. Applications for biosim ilars m ay not be subm itted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed and m ay not be approved until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed.\n\nSales and Marketing Regulations . Our m arketing practices are subject to federal and state laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), C ivil M onetary P enalties Law and F alse Claim s Act, intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. T hese laws can apply to both our direct-to-consum er m arketing practices as well as our m arketing to clinicians and healthcare facilities. T he AKS prohibits soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business that m ay be paid for, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program . T he C ivil M onetary P enalties Law covers a variety of conduct, often violations under other laws, and includes penalties for AKS violations as well as causing the subm ission of false claim s. T he F alse C laim s Act generally prohibits anyone from  knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claim s for paym ent for goods or services, including to governm ent payors, such as M edicare and M edicaid, that are false or fraudulent including false certifications of com pliance with applicable law. The federal governm ent and states also regulate sales and m arketing activities and financial interactions between m anufacturers and healthcare providers and academ ic m edical centers, requiring disclosure to governm ent authorities and the public of such interactions, and the adoption of com pliance standards or program s. State attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the m arketing of prescription drugs under state consum er protection and false advertising laws.\n\nPricing, Reimbursement and Access Regulations. P ricing and reim bursem ent for our products depend in part on governm ent regulation. Any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to reform  the healthcare system  by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or to expand controls on drug pricing, governm ent reim bursem ent, and access to medicines and vaccines on public and private insurance plans could have a m aterial im pact on us.\n\nWe must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharm aceutical products under various governm ent program s including M edicare, M edicaid, the Veterans Adm inistration and the 340B P rogram . W e also m ust report specific prices to state and federal governm ent agencies. T he calculations necessary to determ ine the prices reported are com plex and the failure to do so accurately m ay expose us to enforcem ent m easures. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Product Revenue Deductions section within M D &amp;A and Note 1G.\n\n",

      "answer": "Comirnaty faces multiple legal challenges, including a U.S. lawsuit from GSK alleging infringement of eight patents and a European suit from Promosome over a patent in France, Germany, and Sweden, both seeking unspecified damages. At the same time, Comirnaty's revenue dropped significantly from $11.2 billion in 2023 to $5.35 billion in 2024, reflecting reduced global demand. Despite this decline, Pfizer still holds approximately $4 billion in remaining performance obligations for Comirnaty supply contracts as of December 31, 2024, with deliveries expected through 2028, indicating ongoing contractual commitments despite falling revenue and growing legal risk.",

      "answer": "Medrol is highlighted in three distinct but interconnected ways across Pfizer's 10-K: (1) as a finite-lived brand that incurred a $475 million impairment in 2024 due to changes in development plans and long-range commercial forecasts, signaling declining expectations; (2) as a reclassified asset from indefinite-lived to finite-lived brands, reflecting a shift in Pfizer's valuation and long-term outlook; and (3) as part of the Hospital therapeutic segment, indicating its ongoing role in Pfizer's operational portfolio despite financial de-prioritization. Together, these perspectives suggest that while Medrol remains a marketed product within a core business unit, its financial outlook has deteriorated, prompting both accounting adjustments and strategic reassessment.",

      "question": "How does Pfizer's financial commitment to Paxlovid in future revenue obligations reconcile with its reported 2024 product revenue and its regulatory progress in expanding the drug's approved indications?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2024, include approximately $1 billion in contracted revenue for future Paxlovid deliveries, signaling continued financial commitment to the product. However, Paxlovid's 2024 revenue was $5.7 billion, a significant drop from $18.9 billion in 2022, reflecting reduced demand as the pandemic evolves. Meanwhile, Pfizer has filed for expanded regulatory approval of Paxlovid for high-risk children aged 6\u201311 years in both the U.S. and EU in early 2025, suggesting strategic efforts to broaden its market. This combination of forward-looking contractual obligations, declining recent revenues, and new regulatory filings indicates a nuanced approach to sustaining Paxlovid's commercial relevance in a shifting landscape.",

      "answer": "Abrysvo generated $755 million in 2024 revenue, showing a decline from $890 million in 2023, which suggests potential challenges in sustaining growth. The product received U.S. approval in May 2023 for individuals 60 years and older and expanded to include those 18-59 years at increased risk in October 2024, indicating a strategic regulatory effort to broaden its market. Despite this expansion and its inclusion in Pfizer's vaccine portfolio alongside high-performing products like Prevnar and Comirnaty, Abrysvo's declining revenue raises concerns about market adoption, possibly due to competition or limited demand for RSV vaccines in the targeted age groups.",

      "answer": "The adoption of the long-duration insurance standard affected CVS's financial statements in three key ways: (1) adjustments were made to the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2022 and 2021, (2) changes were applied to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and (3) liability balances were recalibrated starting from the standard\u2019s effective date on January 1, 2021. These changes indicate a retrospective application with material impacts on historical reporting and balance sheet structure.",

        "Hop 2: [CVS](page_140) \u2192 [Long-Duration Insurance Standard]: The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, was adjusted as a result of applying the long-duration insurance standard using a modified retrospective method.",
        "Hop 3: [CVS](page_139) \u2192 [Long-Duration Insurance Standard]: The standard, effective January 1, 2021, resulted in changes to the balances of long-duration insurance liabilities, indicating a foundational shift in liability measurement from that date forward."

      "answer": "CVS held 494 residential mortgage-backed securities with a total fair value of $614 million as of December 31, 2023, which included $60 million in unrealized losses. These securities were classified under Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, indicating valuation based on observable market data. Of these, $97 million were short-term (less than 12 months) and $517 million were long-term (greater than 12 months), showing a significant portion is not immediately liquid. This exposure reflects a decrease in unrealized losses from $89 million in 2022 to $60 million in 2023, suggesting some stabilization in this asset class.",

      "question": "How has CVS's exposure to foreign securities evolved in terms of unrealized losses, fair value categorization, and credit risk treatment across the different investment disclosures in the 10-K?",
      "answer": "CVS's exposure to foreign securities has seen a reduction in unrealized losses from $244 million in 2022 to $122 million in 2023, as shown in the maturity-based breakdown on page 149. On page 154, foreign securities are entirely categorized under Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, indicating valuation based on observable market data rather than direct company inputs. Furthermore, page 147 reveals that CVS did not record any allowance for credit losses on foreign securities in 2023, suggesting management's confidence in the credit quality of these holdings despite the unrealized losses. Together, these perspectives indicate a strategic but cautious approach to foreign securities, with reduced impairment risk and reliance on observable market pricing.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Remicade sales in 2024 reflect both the contractual return of marketing rights to Johnson & Johnson and the geographic distribution of Merck's pharmaceutical revenue?",
      "answer": "The decline in Remicade sales in 2024 is directly tied to the contractual return of marketing rights to Johnson & Johnson on October 1, 2024, which led to a complete cessation of Merck's ability to market the product in Europe, Russia, and T\u00fcrkiye. This is reflected in the financial data showing international sales of Remicade dropping to $114 million in 2024 from $187 million in 2023. Additionally, the loss of these rights is cited in the immunology franchise performance as a factor that offset overall sales growth. The international decline contrasts with U.S. sales growth driven by other products like Keytruda and Winrevair, highlighting the geographic disparity in Merck's pharmaceutical performance.",

Lower sales in the immunology franchise due to the return of the marketing rights for Remicade and Simponi in former M erck territories to Johnson &amp; Johnson on October 1, 2024, and lower sales in the vaccines franchise primarily due to Gardasil/Gardasil 9 also offset sales growth in 2024.\n\nSales in the U.S. grew 13% to $32.3 billion in 2024 primarily driven by higher sales of Keytruda , Winrevair , Gardasil 9, Welireg , Bridion , Lagevrio , and Prevymis , as well as higher alliance revenue from Reblozyl, partially offset by lower sales of Januvia and Vaxneuvance .\n\nInternational sales grew 1% in 2024, or 6% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The devaluation of the A rgentine peso contributed approximately 3 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market.

      "question": "How does the decline in Janumet sales in 2024 align with Merck's broader diabetes franchise performance, Medicaid rebate dynamics, and international market exclusivity trends?",
      "answer": "Janumet sales declined in 2024 both in the U.S. and internationally, reflecting lower pricing, competitive pressures, and the loss of market exclusivity in several regions. Specifically, U.S. sales of Janumet dropped to $161 million in 2024 from $223 million in 2023, while international sales fell to $774 million from $954 million. This decline aligns with Merck's broader diabetes franchise performance, where both Januvia and Janumet contributed to a 33% drop in combined sales. Additionally, Merck paid higher Medicaid rebates in 2024 due to the elimination of the Medicaid rebate cap, which further pressured net pricing. Despite these challenges, Merck retains U.S. market exclusivity for Janumet until May 2026 due to patent settlements, though government price setting under the IRA\u2019s Program beginning in 2027 is expected to further impact future sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MRK](page_130) \u2192 [Janumet]: Janumet sales in 2024 were $935 million globally, with $161 million in the U.S. and $774 million internationally, showing a significant drop from 2023 figures ($1,177 million total, with $223 million in the U.S. and $954 million internationally).",
        "Hop 2: [MRK](page_58) \u2192 [Janumet]: Janumet, along with Januvia, experienced a 33% decline in combined sales due to U.S. pricing pressures, Medicaid rebate changes, and loss of exclusivity in Europe and China. Merck expects further declines after 2026 due to patent expiration and IRA-mandated price setting.",
        "Hop 3: [MRK](page_53) \u2192 [Janumet]: Janumet\u2019s sales decline contributed to the overall contraction in the diabetes franchise, which was a key factor offsetting Merck\u2019s global sales growth in 2024, particularly in the U.S. and international markets."

          "chunk_text": "\nWorldwide combined sales of Januvia and Janumet , medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, declined 33% in 2024 primarily due to lower sales in the U.S., largely reflecting lower pricing and lower demand due to competitive pressures, as well as the ongoing impact of the loss of exclusivity in most markets in Europe, the A sia Pacific region, and in Canada.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan A ct enacted in the U.S. in 2021 included a provision that eliminated the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. A s a result of this provision, the Company paid state M edicaid programs more in rebates than it received on M edicaid sales of Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR in 2024.\n\nIn early 2025, M erck lowered the list price of the Januvia family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount M erck pays to M edicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing, which will be partially offset by continuing volume declines. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products in 2025 compared with 2024.\n\nWhile the key U.S. patent for Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see  Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that Januvia and Janumet will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until M ay  2026 and Janumet XR will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company's sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA . A dditionally , i n 2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Januvia would be included in the first y ear of the IRA 's Program. Pursuant to the IRA 's Program, a government price was set for Januvia , which will become effective on January 1, 2026. A lso, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Janumet and Janumet XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA 's Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA 's Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). A s a result of the anticipated patent expiries in 2026, the government price setting in 2026 and 2027 noted above, as well as ongoing competitive pressures, the Company anticipates significant sales declines for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR in the U.S. in 2026 and thereafter.\n\nThe Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in  all  of  the  EU and for Janumet in some European countries in September 2022. Exclusivity for Janumet was lost in other European countries in A pril 2023. A ccordingly , the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue. Generic equivalents of Januvi a and Janumet have also launched in China.",

Sales growth in 2024 was partially offset by lower sales in the diabetes franchise, due to Januvia and Janumet , and lower sales in the virology franchise largely attributable to Lagevrio . Lower sales in the immunology franchise due to the return of the marketing rights for Remicade and Simponi in former M erck territories to Johnson &amp; Johnson on October 1, 2024, and lower sales in the vaccines franchise primarily due to Gardasil/Gardasil 9 also offset sales growth in 2024.\n\nSales in the U.S. grew 13% to $32.3 billion in 2024 primarily driven by higher sales of Keytruda , Winrevair , Gardasil 9, Welireg , Bridion , Lagevrio , and Prevymis , as well as higher alliance revenue from Reblozyl, partially offset by lower sales of Januvia and Vaxneuvance .\n\nInternational sales grew 1% in 2024, or 6% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The devaluation of the A rgentine peso contributed approximately 3 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. International sales growth was primarily due to higher sales of Keytruda , Vaxneuvance, Prevymis ,  as well as higher sales of animal health products, partially offset by lower sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 , Lagevrio , Bridion , Janumet , Januvia , and Simponi. International sales represented 50% and 53% of total sales in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for details on sales of the Company's products.

It is part of a collaboration with Bayer, where alliance revenue grew 13% in 2024, driven by increased demand in Bayer's territories. However, Adempas faces a looming patent expiration in the EU in 2028, while it has no U.S. patent expiration date listed, suggesting potential market exclusivity challenges in different regions.

(1)\n\nIn M arch 2024, the FDA  approved Winrevair for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA H) (World Health Organization [WHO] Group 1) to increase exercise capacity , improve WHO functional class (FC), and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. In A ugust 2024, the EC approved Winrevair , in combination with other PA H therapies, for the treatment of PA H in adult patients with WHO FC II to III, to improve exercise capacity . The FDA  and EC approvals were based on the STELLAR trial. Winrevair has since launched in Germany . Timing for commercial availability of Winrevair in  the remaining EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures, which is expected to occur in most other major EU markets in the second half of 2025. Winrevair is the subject of a licensing agreement pursuant to which M erck pays a 22% royalty on sales of Winrevair to BM S. The royalty expenses are included in Cost of sales .\n\nAdempas and Verquvo are part of a worldwide collaboration with Bayer A G (Bayer) to market and develop soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulators (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). A dempas is approved for the treatment of certain types of PA H and chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH). Verquvo is approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. A lliance revenue from the collaboration grew 13% in 2024 reflecting higher demand in Bayer's marketing territories. Revenue also includes sales of A dempas and V erquvo in M erck's marketing territories. Sales of Adempas in Merck's marketing territories grew 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher demand.\n\n## Virology\n\n",

      "question": "How does the decline in Simponi sales reflect both the loss of marketing rights in Europe and the broader international sales trends, and what impact did this have on Merck's overall pharmaceutical segment performance in 2024?",
      "answer": "The decline in Simponi sales is directly tied to the October 1, 2024, reversion of marketing rights to Johnson & Johnson in Europe, Russia, and T\u00fcrkiye, which caused a significant drop in international sales. According to the financial data, Simponi generated $543 million in international sales in 2024, down from $710 million in 2023. This decline was part of a broader trend in the immunology franchise, which also saw reduced sales of Remicade. The drop in Simponi sales contributed to the overall flattening of international sales growth, which increased only 1% in 2024 (6% excluding foreign exchange effects), despite gains in products like Keytruda and Prevymis. The loss of Simponi also impacted the pharmaceutical segment\u2019s overall performance, as it was one of several products\u2014including Januvia, Janumet, and Gardasil\u2014that offset strong growth in oncology and hospital acute care.",

        "Hop 3: [MRK](page_53) \u2192 [Simponi]: Simponi\u2019s decline is cited as part of the immunology franchise\u2019s reduced sales, which offset growth in other areas like oncology and hospital acute care, contributing to only modest international sales growth."

      "answer": "Merck recorded a $572.5 million charge in 2023 related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation, as reflected in both the 'Other (income) expense, net' section and the detailed notes on litigation. While the company reached settlements with direct and indirect purchaser plaintiffs in 2023, which were court-approved by October of that year, the litigation landscape remains active as of late 2024, with the Humana and Centene cases having motions to dismiss granted in part and denied in part, prompting the filing of amended complaints in early 2025. This indicates that while a significant portion of the Zetia antitrust litigation has been resolved financially, the company still faces ongoing legal exposure and potential future costs related to this broader litigation framework, which is consistent with Merck's disclosure of continued exposure to antitrust and commercial litigation risks in its broader legal risk disclosures.",

Certain of these preliminary inquiries or activities may lead to the commencement of formal proceedings. Should those proceedings be determined adversely to the Company, monetary fines and/or remedial undertakings may be required.\n\n## Securities Litigation\n\nIn February 2025, a putative class action was filed against M erck and certain of its officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of M erck common stock between February 2022 and February 2025. Plaintiff alleges that M erck violated federal securities laws  by  making  materially  false  and  misleading  statements  and  material  omissions  regarding  demand  for Gardasil/Gardasil  9 in  China.  Plaintiff  seeks unspecified monetary damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and fees and costs.\n\n## Commercial and Other Litigation\n\n## Zetia Antitrust Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, M erck, M SD, Schering Corporation, Schering-Plough Corporation, and M SP Singapore Company LLC (collectively , the M erck Defendants) were defendants in a number of lawsuits filed in 2018 on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Zetia (ezetimibe) alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws, as well as other state statutory and common law causes of action. The cases were consolidated in a federal multidistrict litigation (Zetia MDL) before Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in the Eastern District of V irginia. In A pril 2023, the M erck Defendants reached settlements with the direct purchaser and retailer plaintiffs and a settlement with the indirect purchaser class that the court approved in October 2023.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in 2020 and 2021, United Healthcare Services, Inc. (United Healthcare), Humana Inc. (Humana), Centene Corporation and others (Centene), and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (Kaiser) (collectively , the Insurer Plaintiffs), each filed a lawsuit in a jurisdiction outside of the Eastern District of V irginia against the M erck Defendants and others, making similar allegations as those made in the Zetia M DL, as well as additional allegations about Vytorin. These cases were transferred to the Eastern District of V irginia to proceed with the Zetia M DL.\n\nIn December 2023, the U.S. Judicial Panel on M ultidistrict Litigation remanded the four Insurer Plaintiff cases to the transferor courts in the Northern District of California (Kaiser), the District of M innesota (United Healthcare), and the District of New Jersey (Humana and Centene). The M erck Defendants filed motions to dismiss in each of the Insurer Plaintiff cases. On December 30, 2024, the court granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss in the Humana and Centene cases, and on January 29, 2025, Humana and Centene filed amended complaints.\n\n## RotaTeq Antitrust Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, in M arch 2023, the M ayor and City Council of Baltimore filed a putative class action against M SD in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of all third-party payors in 35 states that indirectly purchased, paid, and/or provided reimbursement for some or all of the purchase price of RotaTeq (Rotavirus V accine, Live Oral, Pentavalent), other than for resale, from M arch 3, 2019 to the present. Plaintiff alleges that M SD violated federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. Plaintiff alleges that M SD has implemented an anticompetitive vaccine bundling scheme whereby M SD leverages its alleged monopoly power in certain pediatric vaccine markets to maintain its alleged monopoly power in the U.S. market for rotavirus vaccines in order to charge supracompetitive prices for RotaTeq . Plaintiff seeks permanent injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages on purchases of RotaTeq , trebled, and fees and costs. In M ay 2023, M SD moved to dismiss the complaint. In November 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss, dismissing plaintiff's Idaho and Utah consumer law claims and allowing all other claims to proceed.\n\n## Bravecto Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, in January 2020, the Company was served with a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey . Following motion practice, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in A ugust 2024, seeking to certify a nationwide class action of purchasers or users of Bravecto (fluralaner) products in the U.S. or its territories between M ay 1, 2014 and July 1, 2021. Plaintiffs contend Bravecto causes neurological events in dogs and cats and alleges violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud A ct, Breach of Warranty , Product Liability , and related theories. The Company moved to dismiss or, alternatively , to strike the class allegations from the third amended complaint, and that motion is pending. A  similar case was filed in Quebec, Canada in M ay 2019. The",

However, the trademark for Baqsimi is now owned by Amphastar, indicating a full transfer of brand ownership despite Lilly's ongoing manufacturing role.

      "answer": "Verzenio is approved for use in HR+, HER2- metastatic and early breast cancer, both as monotherapy and in combination with endocrine therapy. Its U.S. compound patent expires in 2031, with data protection in Europe and Japan expiring in 2028 and 2026, respectively, suggesting a lifecycle extending into the early 2030s in key markets. In 2023, Verzenio contributed to volume growth both in the U.S. and internationally, though international realized prices declined due to market dynamics and supply arrangements. This indicates that while Verzenio is currently a growth driver, its long-term performance will depend on lifecycle management and competitive positioning ahead of patent expiry.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of Tyvyt across therapeutic indications, revenue reporting structure, and trademark ownership reflect its strategic positioning and commercial complexity in Lilly's oncology portfolio?",
      "answer": "Tyvyt is positioned as a key oncology product with multiple therapeutic indications in areas like Hodgkin's lymphoma, NSCLC, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer, primarily in combination with other Lilly products like Alimta (page_6). Its commercialization is governed by a collaboration with Innovent, under which Lilly records its own Tyvyt sales as net product revenue and pays Innovent a portion of the gross margin as cost of sales, while also recognizing collaboration revenue from Innovent\u2019s third-party sales (page_73). Despite its importance, the trademark for Tyvyt is owned by Innovent Biologics, not Lilly, indicating a shared brand control and potential dependency in the Chinese market where the drug is branded as Tyvyt (page_121). This reflects a complex commercial arrangement balancing therapeutic breadth with joint ownership and revenue-sharing dynamics.",

      "question": "What is the full picture of Alimta's role in Eli Lilly's oncology business when considering its therapeutic positioning, recent revenue trends, and the impact of generic competition on its performance in 2023?",
      "answer": "Alimta is a key oncology product indicated for multiple lung cancer treatments, including first-line and maintenance therapy for advanced non-squamous NSCLC and malignant pleural mesothelioma. However, its revenue in 2023 dropped significantly to $72.9 million in the U.S. and $144.6 million outside the U.S., reflecting the entry of multiple generics in mid-2022, which led to a decline in volume and contributed to a broader revenue shift in Lilly's oncology portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: [LLY](page_6) \u2192 [Alimta]: Alimta is disclosed as a core oncology product with multiple indications in lung cancer and mesothelioma, including use in combination with other agents such as Tyvyt.",
        "Hop 2: [LLY](page_47) \u2192 [Alimta]: Alimta is noted to have experienced a decrease in volume in 2023 due to the entry of multiple generics in early 2022, contributing to a decline in U.S. oncology revenue.",

      "answer": "Synjardy is not independently reported in Lilly's revenue disclosures and is bundled under the Jardiance product line, which includes Glyxambi, Synjardy, and Trijardy XR, making it impossible to determine Synjardy's exact revenue contribution. Additionally, Synjardy is trademarked by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, indicating it is not an internally developed product, which may further complicate revenue attribution clarity.",

        "Hop 3: [LLY](page_48) \u2192 [Synjardy]: Similar to page 67, Synjardy is again referenced as part of the Jardiance revenue line item, reinforcing that its financial performance is aggregated and not separately disclosed, affecting revenue transparency."

      "question": "How does the RADV Audit Rule's elimination of the FFS Adjuster, as finalized in January 2023, create financial exposure for CVS when considering its ongoing Medicare Advantage contract audits, potential extrapolation methodologies, and the company's exposure to litigation and regulatory penalties across multiple business lines?",
      "answer": "The RADV Audit Rule, finalized in January 2023, removes the FFS Adjuster, increasing the likelihood of larger repayment obligations for CVS based on extrapolated audit findings from CMS. This change directly impacts the company's Medicare Advantage contracts, which have been subject to increasing RADV audits since 2011, and where CMS now selects contracts based on risk modeling without the mitigating effect of the FFS Adjuster. Additionally, the Rule allows extrapolation in OIG audits for payment years 2018 and beyond, compounding financial exposure. This regulatory shift occurs alongside active litigation and multiple ongoing investigations, including DOJ Civil Investigative Demands related to diagnosis coding and risk adjustment payments, which heighten the risk of material financial penalties. Furthermore, the uncertainty around CMS audit methodologies and the potential for extrapolation affects the company\u2019s ability to accurately forecast Medicare Advantage bids and manage compliance risk across Medicaid and dual eligible programs, where similar regulatory scrutiny and penalties\u2014including premium withholding, sanctions, and fines\u2014also apply. The combined effect of these regulatory, audit, and litigation pressures creates a multi-faceted exposure that could materially affect CVS's financial condition and operating results.",

The Company is cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to these CIDs.\n\nIn May 2017, the Company received a CID from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York requesting documents and information concerning possible false claims submitted to Medicare in connection with reimbursements for prescription drugs under the Medicare Part D program. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to this CID.\n\nSince January 2022, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts has issued subpoenas to Aetna Life Insurance Company seeking, among other things, information in connection with its relationship and compensation arrangements with certain brokers, and the Company may receive similar inquiries in the future. The Company is cooperating with the investigation.\n\n## Stockholder Matters\n\nBeginning in February 2019, multiple class action complaints, as well as a derivative complaint, were filed by putative plaintiffs against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action under federal securities laws that are premised on allegations that the defendants made certain omissions and misrepresentations relating to the performance of the Company's LTC business unit. Since filing, several of the cases have been consolidated, and two have resolved. In February 2025, the District of Rhode Island granted the Company's motion to dismiss In re CVS Health Corp. Securities Act Litigation (formerly known as Waterford ). A derivative case in the District of Rhode Island, Lovoi v. Aguirre , had been stayed pending the outcome of the Waterford case, and the court has scheduled a status conference. In In re CVS Health Corp. Securities Litigation (formerly known as City of Warren and Freundlich ), the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the superior court's order granting the Company's motion to dismiss in January 2025. The Company and its current and former officers and directors are defending themselves against remaining claims.\n\nBeginning in December 2021, the Company has received three demands for inspection of books and records pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law Section 220 ('Section 220 demands'), as well as a derivative complaint ( Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust v. Lynch, et al. ) that was filed in January 2023, which the defendants moved to dismiss. The Section 220 demands and the complaint purport to be related to potential breaches of fiduciary duties by the Board in relation to certain matters concerning opioids. Following the Company's response to the Section 220 demands, two of the three stockholders sent demand letters to the Board containing allegations substantially similar to those made in the earlier Section 220 demands and the derivative matter, and requested that it take certain actions, including consideration of its governance and policies with respect to controlled substances. The Board deferred consideration of these two demands until after the motion to dismiss the Gusinsky case was decided. In July 2024, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the Gusinsky case. In September 2024, the Board received a third demand letter containing similar allegations and requesting the Board take action. The Board has formed a demand review committee to evaluate the demands.\n\nIn January 2022, a shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Northern District of Illinois, Allison v. Oak Street Health, Inc., et al. Defendants include Oak Street Health and certain of its pre-acquisition officers and directors. The putative plaintiffs assert causes of action under various securities laws premised on allegations that defendants made omissions and misrepresentations to investors relating to marketing conduct they allege may violate the False Claims Act. In May 2024, the parties reached agreement in principle to settle this action for an amount immaterial to the Company. The court granted approval of the settlement in December 2024.\n\nBeginning in July 2024, two purported class action complaints, as well as multiple derivative complaints, were filed by putative plaintiffs against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action under federal securities laws and state law that are premised on allegations that the defendants made certain",

          "chunk_text": "The Company's Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by CMS and state Medicaid agencies, which have the right to audit the Company's performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations. The Company's Medicaid products, dual eligible products and CHIP contracts also are subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state Medicaid agencies regarding the services provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services, network requirements (including mandatory inclusion of specified high-cost providers), and other aspects of these programs, and by external review organizations which audit Medicaid plans on behalf of state Medicaid agencies. The laws, regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company and other participants in Medicaid and dual eligible programs, including requirements that the Company submit encounter data to the applicable state agency, are extensive, complex and subject to change. For example, in April 2024, CMS finalized the Managed Care Rule, which addresses five primary areas: (1) access in managed care, including network adequacy; (2) state directed payments; (3) medical loss ratio standards; (4) in lieu of services and settings and (5) quality and performance assessment. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards, and its Medicaid and dual eligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources. CMS and/or state Medicaid agencies may fine the Company, withhold payments to the Company, seek premium and other refunds, terminate the Company's existing contracts, elect not to award the Company new contracts or not to renew the Company's existing contracts, prohibit the Company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in or refuse to automatically assign members to one or more of the Company's Medicaid or dual eligible products, exclude the Company from participating in one or more Medicaid or dual eligible programs and/or institute other sanctions and/or civil monetary penalties against the Company if it fails to comply with CMS or state regulations or contractual requirements. CMS has proposed requiring that health plans offering certain dual eligible programs must also offer Medicaid programs, which has resulted in the Company refraining from bidding in certain jurisdictions and could impact the Company's ability to obtain or retain membership in its dual eligible programs.\n\nThe Company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the Medicaid program, nor can it predict the impact those changes will have on its business operations or operating results, but the effects could be materially adverse.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid Audits - CMS regularly audits the Company's performance to determine its compliance with CMS' regulations and its contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of services it provides to Medicare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries. For example, CMS conducts risk adjustment data validation ('RADV') audits of a subset of Medicare Advantage contracts for each contract year. Since 2011, CMS has selected certain of the Company's Medicare Advantage contracts for various years for RADV audit, and the number of RADV audits continues to increase. The OIG also is auditing the Company's risk adjustment data and that of other companies, and the Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue auditing risk adjustment data. The Company also has received Civil Investigative Demands ('CIDs') from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with investigations of the Company's identification and/or submission of diagnosis codes related to risk adjustment payments, including patient chart review processes, under Parts C and D of the Medicare program.\n\nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule concerning Part C contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits (the 'RADV Audit Rule'). The RADV Audit Rule eliminated the application of a fee-for-service adjuster ('FFS Adjuster') in contract-level RADV audits but continued the use of extrapolation in such audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. The FFS Adjuster that was announced in 2012 was to be used by CMS to determine a permissible level of payment error. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare Advantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent that their extrapolated payment errors ex ceeded the error rate in Original Medicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare Advantage organizations are subject. CMS is conducting RADV audits of Medicare Advantage organizations, including the Company's Medicare Advantage plans, for payment year 2018 and subsequent payment years and may use extrapolation without the application of a FFS Adjuster. The RADV Audit Rule may have potential adverse effects, which could be material, on the Company's operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. CMS also has announced that it will not conduct RADV audits on all contracts; instead, it will only audit contracts it believes are at the highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling. The RADV Audit Rule is subject to ongoing litigation and the outcome and future impacts are uncertain.\n\nIn addition, state Medicaid agencies regularly audit, and state Attorneys General regularly investigate, the Company's performance across all areas of its contractual obligations to the state to determine compliance and quality of services. The Company may be subject to, among other penalties, significant fines, sanctions, corrective actions, and enrollment freezes depending on the findings of these audits and reviews. The Company's ongoing performance and compliance with program requirements can impact our ability to expand and retain Medicaid business. State Medicaid agencies are also increasingly using the audit process to challenge the legality of PBM practices, such as guaranteed effective rate reconciliations with retail pharmacies and transmission fees.",

The lack of detail provided with respect to how CMS will select contracts and claims to audit, the methodology CMS will use, and how it will extrapolate as part of the RADV Audit Rule may impact future Medicare Advantage bids and result in other implications. The RADV Audit Rule also permits extrapolation of OIG contract level audits for payment years 2018 forward. The RADV Audit Rule is subject to ongoing litigation and the outcome and future impacts are uncertain.\n- Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures. Further, as a result of the ACA and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules, clients of our PBM business could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this phenomenon occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D products.\n- Our Medicare Part D operating results and our ability to expand our Medicare Part D business could be adversely affected if: the cost and complexity of Medicare Part D exceed management's expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; further changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D (including changes related to the IRA) are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; changes to the applicable regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; the government alters Medicare Part D program requirements or reduces funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; or reinsurance thresholds are reduced.\n- The IRA contains significant changes to the Part D program that began in 2023 and will continue to 2032 that shifts more of the claim liability to plans and away from the government, including a complete redesign of the Part D standard benefit effective in 2025.\n- We have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our Medicaid products due to difficulties with providers and third-party vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions. As states increase their reliance on encounter data, and some states mandate that certain amounts be included or excluded from encounter data, these difficulties could affect the Medicaid premium rates we receive and how Medicaid membership is assigned to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our Medicaid operating results and cash flows and/or our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain Medicaid programs.\n- If we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a CMS audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, civil monetary penalties or other sanctions, including fines and penalties under the False Claims Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D or other government programs, and on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n- The resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations after being suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the number of members eligible for the Company's Medicaid plans, which could impact our operating results and cash flows from the Medicaid business.\n- Certain of our Medicaid contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data. The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our Medicaid programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and, in part, to set premium rates. We have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect accurate, or to correct inaccurate or incomplete, encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding, operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance.\n- CMS has proposed requiring that health plans offering certain dual eligible programs must also offer Medicaid programs, which could further impact the Company's ability to obtain or retain membership in its dual eligible programs. In addition, states are increasingly requiring companies to offer Medicaid within a state and conducting competitive bid processes to qualify to offer dual eligible products.\n\nPrograms funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that percentage to increase.",

      "question": "How does CVS's exposure to adverse selection in its Commercial Health Care Benefits business, as reflected in premium rate increase challenges, interact with its Public Exchange participation strategy and minimum MLR rebate obligations to affect overall profitability and operating margin risk?",
      "answer": "CVS faces a complex interplay of risks from adverse selection in its Commercial Health Care Benefits business, particularly in small group products where higher-risk individuals may disproportionately enroll, leading to higher-than-anticipated medical costs. This risk is compounded by regulatory scrutiny of premium rate increases, as highlighted on page 55, where challenges or delays in implementing rate increases could lead to margin compression. On page 42, the company notes that adverse selection is a key factor in pricing its 2025 Commercial Health Care Benefits rate increases, which are intended to reflect projected medical cost trends and risk profiles. However, as seen on page 45, participation in Public Exchanges introduces further uncertainty, as adverse selection among individuals who utilize more expensive services can undermine the accuracy of pricing projections. Additionally, the company is constrained by ACA and state minimum MLR rebate requirements (page 55), which cap margins and expose CVS to financial risk if medical costs exceed projections. Together, these factors create a scenario where adverse selection not only threatens the accuracy of pricing models but also limits the company's ability to offset increased costs due to regulatory constraints, thereby heightening the risk of reduced profitability and operating margin compression.",

          "chunk_text": "Since 2013, HHS has issued determinations to health plans that their premium rate increases were 'unreasonable,' and we may experience challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in certain states. Regulators or legislatures in several states have implemented or are considering limits on premium rate increases, either by enforcing existing legal requirements more stringently or proposing different regulatory standards. Regulators or legislatures in several states also have conducted hearings on proposed premium rate increases, which can result, and in some instances have resulted, in substantial delays in implementing proposed rate increases even if they ultimately are approved. Our plans can be excluded from participating in small group Public Exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of 'unreasonable' rate increases. Any significant rate increases we may request heighten the risks of adverse publicity, adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied, reduced or delayed, which could lead to operating margin compression.\n\nWe anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rates in our Insured Health Care Benefits products. We may not be able to obtain rates that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policies profitable in one or more product lines or geographies. If we are unable to obtain adequate premium rates and/or premium rate increases, it could materially and adversely affect our operating margins and MBRs and our ability to earn adequate returns on Insured Health Care Benefits products in one or more states or cause us to withdraw from certain geographies and/or products.\n\n## Minimum MLR rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in our Insured Health Care Benefits products while leaving us exposed to higher than expected medical costs. Challenges to our minimum MLR rebate methodology and/or reports could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nThe ACA's minimum MLR rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in Health Care Benefits' Commercial Insured business. CMS and state minimum MLR rebate regulations limit the level of margin we can earn in our Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Insured businesses. Certain portions of our Health Care Benefits Medicaid and FEHB program business also are subject to minimum MLR rebate requirements in addition to but separate from those imposed by the ACA. Minimum MLR rebate requirements leave us exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in our pricing. The process supporting the management and determination of the amount of MLR rebates payable is complex and requires judgment, and the minimum MLR reporting requirements are detailed. CMS has also proposed, but not yet finalized, a definition of 'prescription drug price concessions' for commercial MLR calculation purposes, which would make additional PBM information available to plans and the HHS, potentially further complicating the MLR calculation process. Federal and state auditors are challenging our Commercial Health Care Benefits business' compliance with the ACA's minimum MLR requirements as well as our FEHB plans' compliance with OPM's FEHB program-specific minimum MLR requirements. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also are subject to minimum MLR audits. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to enroll new members. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. Additional challenges to our methodology and/or reports relating to minimum MLR and related rebates by federal and state regulators and private litigants are reasonably possible. The outcome of these audits and additional challenges could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n## Our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in laws and policies governing employers and by union organizing activity.\n\nCongress and certain state legislatures continue to consider and pass legislation that increases our costs of doing business, including increased minimum wages and requiring employers to provide paid sick leave or paid family leave. In addition, our employee-related operating costs may be increased by union organizing activity and it is possible that the National Labor Relations Board may adopt regulatory changes through re-making or case law that could facilitate union organizing. If we are unable to reflect these increased ex penses in our pricing or otherwise modify our operations to mitigate the effects of such increases, our operating results will be adversely affected.\n\n## We face international political, legal and compliance, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that may be more significant than in our domestic operations.\n\nWe are in the process of winding down our international insurance operations in 2025. However, our remaining international operations present political, legal, compliance, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operations.

Specifically:\n\n- As competition increases in the geographies in which we operate, including competition from new entrants, a significant increase in price compression and/or reimbursement pressures could occur, and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive.\n- In our Health Care Benefits segment, we must often bid against our competitors in a highly competitive environment to acquire and retain our government customers' business. Winning bids for Medicaid and dual eligible programs often are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidders, and may also be withdrawn or cancelled by the issuing agency. CMS has proposed requiring that health plans offering certain dual eligible programs must also offer Medicaid programs, which has resulted in the Company refraining from bidding in certain jurisdictions and could further impact the Company's ability to obtain or retain membership in its dual eligible programs.\n- In our Health Care Benefits segment, our customers have considerable flexibility in moving between us and our competitors. We may lose members to competitors with more favorable pricing, or our customers may purchase different types of products from us that are less profitable, adversely affecting our revenues and operating results. In addition, our Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and CHIP products may be subject to termination without cause, periodic re-bid, rate adjustment and program redesign, as customers seek to contain their benefit costs, particularly in an uncertain economy. These actions may adversely affect our membership, revenues and operating results.\n- We requested increases in our premium rates in our Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2025 and expect to request future increases in those rates in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significant assessments, fees and taxes imposed by federal and state governments, including as a result of the ACA. Our rates also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our products will be selected by people with a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established pricing for the applicable products (also known as 'adverse selection'), particularly in small group Commercial products. These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adverse publicity, adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied, reduced or delayed, which could lead to operating margin compression.\n- The competitive success of our Health Services segment is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies.\n- The competitive success of our Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment and our specialty pharmacy operations is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms as the payors' clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks.\n- In our PBM business, we maintain contractual relationships with brand name drug manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Manufacturer's rebates often depend on a PBM's ability to meet contractual requirements, including the placement of a manufacturer's products on the PBM's formularies. If we lose our relationship with one or more drug manufacturers, or if the discounts or rebates provided by drug manufacturers decline, our operating results, cash flows and/or prospects could be adversely affected.\n- If laws or regulations are promulgated that limit the number of PBMs available in a particular business or geography, competition in those businesses and geographies could be amplified and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.",

We are also creating new customer service programs and product offerings. To participate on the Public Exchanges, we have to respond to pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and regulators as well as potentially disruptive new entrants, which could reduce our profit margins. Due to the price transparency provided by Public Exchanges, when we market products we face competitive pressures from existing and new competitors who may have lower cost structures.

Negative publicity may come as a result of adverse media coverage, litigation against us and other industry participants, the ongoing public debates over drug pricing, PBMs, government involvement in drug pricing and purchasing, changes to the ACA, governmental hearings and/or investigations, actual or perceived shortfalls regarding our industries' or our own products, including Medicare Advantage plans in general, and/or business practices (including PBM operations, drug pricing and insurance coverage determinations) and social media and other media relations activities.

Completion factors are derived from historical claim payment patterns and are applied to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred, particularly for claims older than three months. For more recent claims, the Company places greater emphasis on assumed healthcare cost trend rates, which are influenced by factors such as utilization of medical services, unit cost changes, and product mix. These assumptions are subject to significant uncertainty, and changes in either completion factors or cost trends could materially affect the liability estimate. To ensure reliability, the audit process includes testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, evaluating the actuarial methodologies and assumptions used, and independently calculating a range of reserve estimates for comparison to management's best estimate.

          "chunk_text": "## Other Insurance Liabilities\n\n## Unpaid Claims\n\nUnpaid claims consist primarily of reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts, including an estimate for IBNR as of the financial statement date. Reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts are based upon the Company's estimate of the present value of future benefits, which is based on assumed investment yields and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity and recoveries from the U.S. Social Security Administration. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, contractual requirements, claim incidence rates, claim recovery rates, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company discounts certain claim liabilities related to group long-term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contracts. The discount rates generally reflect the Company's expected investment returns for the investments supporting all incurral years of these liabilities. The discount rates for retrospectively-rated contracts are set at contractually specified levels. The Company's estimates of unpaid claims are subject to change due to changes in the underlying experience of the insurance contracts, changes in investment yields or other factors, and these changes are recorded in current and future benefits in the consolidated statements of operations in the period they are determined. The Company estimates its reserve for claims IBNR for life products largely based on completion factors. The completion factors used are based on the Company's historical ex perience and reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim payment patterns, changes in business volume and other factors. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than historical periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required to cover future life benefit payments. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company's estimate of unpaid claims IBNR in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, unpaid claims balances of $280 million and $713 million were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, unpaid claims balances of $285 million and $834 million were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively.\n\nSubstantially all life and disability insurance liabilities have been fully ceded to unrelated third parties through indemnity reinsurance agreements; however, the Company remains directly obligated to the policyholders.\n\n## Future Policy Benefits\n\nFuture policy benefits consist primarily of reserves for products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, including limited payment pension and annuity contracts and long-term care insurance contracts. Contracts are grouped into cohorts by contract type and issue year. The liability for future policy benefits is adjusted for differences between actual and expected experience.\n\nReserves for limited payment pension and annuity contracts represent the Company's estimate of the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and are computed using actuarial principles that consider, among other things, assumptions reflecting anticipated mortality and retirement experience. On an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, the Company reviews mortality assumptions against both industry standards and its experience.\n\nReserves for long-term care insurance contracts represent the Company's estimate of the present value of future benefits and settlement costs to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums. The Company's estimate of the present value of future benefits under such contracts is based upon mortality, morbidity, lapse and interest rate assumptions. On an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, the Company reviews its mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions against its experience. Annually, or each time the assumptions are changed, the net premium ratio used to calculate the future policy benefit liability is updated to reflect actual ex perience, as well as the impact of any change in assumptions on the Company's future cash flows.\n\nThe Company discounts its future policy benefit liability using a curve of spot rates derived from Single A rated fixed income instruments. At each reporting date, the Company will measure its liability for future policy benefits using both the current spot rate curve and the locked-in discount rate at each cohort's inception. Any difference between the measured liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, future policy benefits balances of $371 million and $4.2 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, future policy benefits balances of $393 million and $4.6 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively.",

          "chunk_text": "these actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company's estimate of IBNR in 2024.\n\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to estimate 'completion factors.' The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within six  months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents the Company's estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company's health care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser ex tent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company's completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\n\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\n\nThe Company's health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such services. Many factors influence the health care cost trend rate, including the Company's ability to manage benefit costs through product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs, as well as the mix of the Company's business. The health status of the Company's Insured members, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per member utilization and unit costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs), direct-toconsumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory environment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company's health care cost trend rate.\n\nFor each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result, considerable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date; and the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. For each reporting period the Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential volatility in assumed completion factors and health care cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover its obligations at December 31, 2024; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company's estimates. A worsening (or improvement) of the Company's health care cost trend rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in estimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2024 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\n\nEach quarter, the Company re-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and other changes in facts and circumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company's estimates of health care costs payable could develop either favorably (that is, its actual health care costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably. The changes in the Company's estimate of health care costs payable may relate to a prior quarter, prior year or earlier periods. For a roll forward of the Company's health care costs payable, see Note 8 ''Health Care Costs Payable.'' The Company's reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of its ultimate liability for health care costs payable.",

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's liability for health care costs payable includes estimated payments for (1) services rendered to members but not yet reported and (2) claims that have been reported but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, 'IBNR'). The estimated IBNRliability is developed utilizing actuarial principles and assumptions that include historical and projected claimsubmission and processing patterns, historical and assumed medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claiminventory levels, changes in membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors to record the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management's actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. In particular, the estimate is sensitive to the assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. |\n|                                            | Auditing management's actuarial best estimate of IBNRreserves for health care costs payable within the Health Care Benefits segment involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management's assumptions used in the valuation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process for estimating IBNRreserves.

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties:\n\n## Key Business Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company expects medical membership declines in its Medicare and individual exchange products. Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",

      "answer": "The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022, as disclosed in the equity compensation section, meaning all stock options and restricted shares granted after that date were issued under the 2022 plan. However, the fair value of options granted under the 2012 plan in fiscal years 2021\u20132023 was calculated using a blended volatility rate based on 10-year historical data and 5-week average implied volatility, resulting in average fair values of $20.86, $23.23, and $27.85, respectively. The formal documentation of the 2012 plan and its award agreements, including stock option, restricted share unit, and performance share unit terms, are listed as incorporated exhibits in the company's filing, specifically referenced under items 10(a) through 10(g).",

      "question": "How does J&J's legal challenge to the Inflation Reduction Act's drug pricing provisions, combined with IMBRUVICA's declining U.S. sales and global revenue trends, reflect the broader strategic and financial risks facing the product in both the short and long term?",
      "answer": "J&J's legal challenge to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which targets drug pricing in Medicare, reflects strategic and regulatory risk concerns, particularly since IMBRUVICA is listed as a 'Selected Drug' under the IRA, potentially subject to government-established pricing. Financially, IMBRUVICA's U.S. sales declined by 24.4% in 2023 compared to 2022, and globally, total sales dropped by 13.7% to $3,264 million, signaling market pressure. These trends align with the broader concern that IRA pricing mechanisms could further compress margins and constrain revenue growth for IMBRUVICA, especially in the U.S. market, which has already seen a significant decline. The combination of litigation risk, regulatory uncertainty, and real-time revenue contraction paints a complex risk profile for IMBRUVICA\u2019s future performance.",

        "Hop 1: JNJ(page_11) \u2192 IMBRUVICA: J&J is challenging the constitutionality of the IRA\u2019s Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, which includes IMBRUVICA on the 'Selected Drug' list, signaling regulatory and pricing risk.",
        "Hop 2: JNJ(page_31) \u2192 IMBRUVICA: IMBRUVICA's total sales declined by 13.7% in 2023 to $3,264 million, showing financial pressure in the broader portfolio context.",

      "question": "Given STELARA's strong revenue growth and its inclusion in the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare drug price negotiation program, how is JNJ balancing the product's strategic importance in immunology with the potential pricing pressures and ongoing litigation risk associated with the IRA?",
      "answer": "STELARA generated $10.858 billion in 2023 revenue, representing 11.7% growth and making it a cornerstone of JNJ\u2019s Immunology portfolio, which totaled $18.052 billion. Its inclusion in the IRA\u2019s Selected Drug list introduces pricing uncertainty, as the legislation allows the government to set prices for Medicare starting in 2026, potentially affecting profitability. Janssen has actively challenged the constitutionality of the IRA\u2019s pricing provisions, signaling JNJ\u2019s intent to defend STELARA\u2019s market position and pricing autonomy. This litigation reflects a strategic effort to preserve revenue streams from a product central to the Innovative Medicine segment\u2019s performance, which reported total sales of $54.759 billion in 2023. The company\u2019s proactive legal stance aligns with its emphasis on STELARA\u2019s therapeutic value across multiple immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, suggesting a broader strategy to protect its high-performing assets from regulatory pricing constraints.",

      "question": "How does the declining global sales trend of XARELTO in 2023, as reported in the product-specific financial data, align with Johnson & Johnson's strategic response to the Inflation Reduction Act's potential pricing pressures and its litigation against CMS over the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program?",
      "answer": "The declining global sales of XARELTO by 4.4% in 2023, as seen in both the segment performance table (page 31) and the detailed sales breakdown (page 90), aligns with the company's acknowledgment of potential pricing pressures under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which specifically named XARELTO on the 'Selected Drug' list for Medicare price negotiations. In response, Janssen filed litigation challenging the constitutionality of the IRA\u2019s Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, citing potential violations of First and Fifth Amendment rights (page 11). This litigation reflects a strategic legal maneuver to resist pricing constraints on XARELTO, which remains a key product in the Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other category despite its declining sales. The company\u2019s proactive legal stance suggests an effort to mitigate the financial impact of potential price reductions under the IRA, especially given the uncertainty surrounding future pricing mechanisms and the product's significant contribution to the Innovative Medicine portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JNJ (page_11) \u2192 XARELTO: JNJ discloses that XARELTO is on the CMS 'Selected Drug' list under the IRA, triggering potential government-established pricing starting in 2026, and that Janssen has filed litigation challenging the IRA\u2019s pricing provisions.",
        "Hop 2: JNJ (page_31) \u2192 XARELTO: XARELTO\u2019s 2023 global sales declined by 4.4% year-over-year, contributing $2.365 billion to the Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other category, which saw an overall 5.5% decline.",
        "Hop 3: JNJ (page_90) \u2192 XARELTO: Detailed sales data confirms the 4.4% drop in XARELTO\u2019s global sales in 2023, with no international sales reported, indicating a U.S.-centric decline that aligns with the IRA\u2019s focus on Medicare pricing."

      "question": "How does the rapid growth of CARVYKTI in Johnson & Johnson's oncology portfolio reflect both its strategic positioning in the Innovative Medicine segment and its geographic sales distribution dynamics?",
      "answer": "CARVYKTI, a CAR-T-cell therapy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, is strategically positioned within Johnson & Johnson's Innovative Medicine segment, which focuses on high-impact therapeutic areas like oncology. In 2023, CARVYKTI achieved $500 million in global sales, a significant increase from $133 million in 2022, indicating strong growth momentum. This growth is primarily driven by the U.S. market, where sales reached $469 million in 2023, compared to only $133 million in 2022, while international sales were modest at $30 million. This suggests that the product is currently more dominant in the U.S., aligning with the company's strategic emphasis on high-value oncology therapies within its Innovative Medicine portfolio.",

      "question": "How does Biktarvy's regulatory expansion, its commercial risk profile in the HIV market, and its financial performance collectively shape Gilead's strategic positioning in 2024?",
      "answer": "Biktarvy received FDA approval for an expanded indication in 2024 to treat HIV patients with known or suspected M184V/I resistance, reinforcing its clinical positioning and broadening its applicability (page_8). However, Gilead faces significant commercial risk as Biktarvy is a core component of its HIV portfolio, which contributes substantially to revenue, and the company is vulnerable to market share erosion from generics and shifting treatment paradigms (page_18). Financially, Biktarvy generated $13.423 billion in total product sales in 2024, representing growth from $11.850 billion in 2023, indicating its continued dominance in the HIV market despite these risks (page_66). Together, these elements suggest that while Biktarvy remains a strategic asset with strong market performance and regulatory momentum, its central role in Gilead\u2019s revenue makes the company highly exposed to competitive and therapeutic landscape changes.",

        "Hop 1: [GILD](page_8) \u2192 [Biktarvy]: FDA approved Biktarvy for expanded use in patients with M184V/I resistance and updated its label for use in pregnant individuals, enhancing its clinical relevance.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "question": "Given Trodelvy's recent clinical setbacks in metastatic NSCLC and continued commercial success, how is Gilead balancing its investment in expanding the drug\u2019s indications versus focusing on more established oncology opportunities?",
      "answer": "Gilead is recalibrating its oncology investment strategy around Trodelvy in response to mixed clinical and commercial signals. On the regulatory front, Trodelvy received a Breakthrough Therapy designation for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (page 8), signaling ongoing interest in expanding its indications. However, clinical setbacks in metastatic NSCLC\u2014including the failure of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 trial to meet its primary endpoint\u2014led to a strategic decision to discontinue development in the second-line NSCLC indication and triggered significant impairments of the associated IPR&D asset: $2.4 billion in Q1 and $1.8 billion in Q3 of 2024 (page 43). Despite these setbacks, Trodelvy remains commercially strong, generating $1,315 million in global sales in 2024 (page 66), suggesting continued market demand and potential for growth in approved indications. This dynamic indicates that Gilead may be prioritizing further development in indications where Trodelvy has clearer regulatory and clinical signals, while scaling back in less promising areas like second-line NSCLC.",

('Arcellx ') collaboration milestones met; and\n- $47 million Tmunity Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tmunity') acquisition milestones met.\n\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses were $1.2 billion in 2023, primarily related to the following transactions:\n\n- $313 million Arcellx  collaboration;\n- $269 million Tmunity acquisition;\n- $218 million XinThera, Inc. acquisition;\n- $97 million Assembly Biosciences, Inc. collaboration; and\n- $60 million Compugen Ltd. licensing agreement.\n\nSee Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 7. Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## In-Process Research and Development Impairments\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our indefinite-lived IPR&amp;D intangible asset related to Trodelvy for metastatic NSCLC was approximately $5.9 billion. In addition to NSCLC, Trodelvy is being explored for potential investigational use in a range of tumor types where  Trop-2 is highly expressed.  G ilead's clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC includes ongoing Phase 2 and registrational Phase 3 studies for Trodelvy as a first- or second-line indication.\n\nIn January 2024, we received data from our Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study of Trodelvy evaluating sacituzumab govitecan-hziy ('SG ') indicating that the study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival in previously treated metastatic NSCLC, thus triggering a review for potential impairment of the NSCLC IPR&amp;D intangible asset. Based on our evaluation of the study results and all other data currently available, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&amp;D intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $2.4 billion in  In-process research and development impairments on our  Consolidated Statements of Operations during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nIn September 2024, based on discussions with regulators and external opinion leaders and the completed evaluation of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data, we made a strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC for Trodelvy in the second-line indication. This decision triggered a review for potential impairment of the NSCLC IPR&amp;D intangible asset. Based on our evaluation, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&amp;D intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $1.8 billion in  In-process research and development impairments on our  Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTo arrive at the revised estimated fair value, we used a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value, which requires the use of Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs, including critical estimated inputs, such as: revenues and operating profits related to the planned utilization of SG  in NSCLC, which, include inputs such as addressable patient population, projected market share, treatment duration, and the life of the potential commercialized product; the probability of technical and regulatory success; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of SG  in NSCLC; an appropriate discount rate based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Our revised discounted cash flows for the March 31, 2024 fair value estimation primarily reflected the smaller addressable market that Trodelvy could serve among metastatic NSCLC patients and a delay in expected launch timing for second-line plus patients.  Our revised discounted cash flows for the  September 30, 2024 fair value estimation primarily reflected the removal of cash flows associated with second-line plus patients.\n\nThere were no IPR&amp;D impairment charges in the three months ended December 31, 2024. Therefore, total In-process research and development impairments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations were $4.2 billion in 2024, and the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&amp;D intangible asset was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, which reflects Trodelvy's opportunity as a combination therapy in first-line metastatic NSCLC patients supported by its ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in this patient population.",

It is included in a list of key products contributing to Gilead\u2019s revenue, although specific sales figures are not disclosed.

          "chunk_text": "## Health Care Fraud and Abuse / Anti-Bribery Regulation\n\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care 'fraud and abuse,' including anti-kickback laws and false claim laws. Antikickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to knowingly and willingly solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. False claims laws generally prohibit  anyone  from  knowingly  presenting,  or  causing  to  be  presented,  a  false  or  fraudulent  claim  for  payment  by  federal  and  certain  state  payers  (including Medicare and Medicaid), or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. In addition, FDA regulates written and verbal communications about our products. In addition to federal law, states also have consumer protection and false claims laws. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities, our sales, marketing, patient support, medical, clinical and public affairs activities  may  be  subject  to  scrutiny  under  these  laws.  For  ex ample,  recently  there  has  been  enhanced  scrutiny  by  government  enforcement authorities  of  company-sponsored  patient  assistance  programs,  including  co-pay  assistance  programs  and  manufacturer  donations  to  third-party  charities  that provide such assistance, reimbursement support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. Similarly, in Europe, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are subject to strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians' codes of professional conduct, as applicable, including the EU member states anti-corruption laws and the UK Bribery Act 2010.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom.\n\nWe have implemented trainings and programs geared toward compliance with these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws or anti-bribery laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). V iolations can also lead to the imposition of a Corporate Integrity Agreement or similar government oversight program, even if we disagree with the government's perspective that we have violated any rules or guidance.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  'We  are  impacted  by  evolving  laws,  regulations  and  legislative  or  regulatory  actions  applicable  to  the healthcare industry.'\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations that require compliance with federal, state and local regulations for the protection of the environment. Growing concern regarding climate change has resulted in an evolving legal and regulatory landscape, with new requirements enacted to prevent, mitigate or adapt to the  implications  of  climate  change.  These  regulations,  which  can  differ  across  jurisdictions,  subject  us  to  many  transition  risks,  including,  for  ex ample,  new  or expanded  carbon  pricing  or  tax es,  increased  compliance  costs,  restrictions  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  investment  in  new  technologies,  increased  carbon disclosure and transparency, investments in data gathering and reporting systems, upgrades of facilities to meet new building codes and the redesign of utility systems, which could increase the company's operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy. For example, over 80 countries committed to the United Nations COP26 Health Programme's initiatives on climate resilient and low carbon sustainable health systems. As such, there is an increasing expectation for the health sector to implement commitments to decarbonize and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Failure to sufficiently decarbonize or comply with climate-related requirements may threaten our ability to operate in certain geographies and negatively affect our business. Our suppliers and third-party manufacturers and corporate partners face similar transition risks that could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nWhile costs related to compliance with environmental regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate that these costs will have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, earnings and competitive position.\n\nFor more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors 'Climate change and natural disasters, as well as legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, can negatively affect our business and operations.'\n\n## Other Information\n\nWe are subject  to  the  information  requirements  of  the  Securities  Ex change Act  of  1934  ('Ex change Act').  Therefore,  we  file  periodic  reports,  prox y  and information statements and other information with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'). SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with SEC.",

          "chunk_text": "Any adverse developments affecting or resulting from any single entity within our manufacturing operations or the operations of our CMOs and corporate partners can result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the development and commercial supply of our products, which may result in us not being able to generate sufficient quantities of clinical or commercial product to meet market demand and may cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval.  We have incurred, and will continue to incur, inventory write-off charges and other expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and quality standards as well as changes we may adopt in our manufacturing strategy, and we may need to undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenues or market share and damage our reputation. Our business may be adversely affected if approval of any of our product candidates were delayed or if production of our products were interrupted.\n\n## Regulatory and Other Legal Risks\n\nOur operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance, including if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, could delay or halt commercialization of our products.\n\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by FDA, EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We have filed, and anticipate that we will continue to file, for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products. These and any future marketing applications we file may not be approved by the regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all.  For  ex ample,  in  October  2022,  we  announced that  FDA issued a complete response letter for our  Biologics  License Application for bulevirtide for the treatment of adults with hepatitis delta virus infection. Even if marketing approval is granted for our product candidates, there may be significant limitations on their use. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our product candidates under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nFurther, how we manufacture and sell our products is subject to extensive regulation and review. For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. In certain circumstances, we may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers, restrictions on distribution or use of a product and other elements FDA deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or product candidates, including serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, or problems with our manufacturing, safety reporting or promotional activities, may result in regulatory approvals being delayed, denied or granted with significant restrictions on our products, including limitations on or the withdrawal of the products from the market.\n\nAs additional studies are conducted after obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients, including patients with underlying health problems or those taking other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety, resistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed indications, or the halt of product sales.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  have  been  moving  towards  more  active  and  transparent  pharmacovigilance  and  are  making  greater  amounts  of  stand-alone  safety information  and  clinical  trial  data  directly  available  to  the  public  through  websites  and  other  means,  such  as  periodic  safety  update  report  summaries,  risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action.\n\nFailure  to  comply  with  these  or  other  requirements  imposed  by  FDA  could  result  in  significant  civil  monetary  penalties,  fines,  suspensions  of  regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecutions.",

Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nWe also generate revenues from other activities, including royalties for outbound licenses of our intellectual property and other payments received from our collaborations with third-party partners.\n\n## Commercialization and Distribution\n\nWe have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in more than 35 countries. Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party wholesalers, distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial teams promote our products through direct field contact with physicians, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts between the distributor and G ilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the U.S. exclusively through the wholesale channel. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 91% of our product sales in the U.S. and approximately 65% of our total worldwide revenues were from three large wholesalers: Cardinal Health, Inc., Cencora, Inc. and McKesson Corporation, and their specialty distributor affiliates. We sell and distribute our products in Europe and countries outside the U.S. where the product is approved, either through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe operate  in  a  highly  competitive  environment.  Our  products  compete  with  other  commercially  available  products  based  primarily  on  efficacy,  safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease of use, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, distribution and marketing. We also face significant competition from: (i) large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical firms acting either independently or together with other such companies to pursue the development of products and technologies that may be competitive with our existing products or research programs; (ii) academic  institutions,  government  agencies  and  other  public  and  private  organizations  conducting  research  who  may  seek  patent  protection  or  may  establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs; (iii) pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers as our products mature, which often result in a reduction of the net product prices; and (iv) new branded or generic products introduced into major markets, which may impact our ability to maintain pricing and market share.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  'We  face  significant  competition  from  global  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  companies,  specialized pharmaceutical firms and generic drug manufacturers.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur research and development ('R&amp;D') mission is to discover and develop transformational therapies in areas of high unmet medical need.  Our product development efforts are focused primarily on viral diseases, cancer and inflammatory diseases. Our team of research scientists is engaged in the discovery and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to the approval of innovative medicines and therapies that will transform care for people around the world.  We have committed significant resources to internal  R&amp;D opportunities and external business development activity to drive innovation and growth of our business. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of start-up activities in-house. We rely on thirdparty contract research organizations to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management, patient enrollment, ongoing monitoring, site management and bioanalysis.\n\nThe development of product candidates and investigational therapies in our pipeline is subject to various risks and uncertainties that could result in delays or prevent completion of the development and approval of our product candidates. For more information about these risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A. Risk Factors 'We face risks in our clinical trials, including the potential for unfavorable results, delays in anticipated timelines and disruption.' Drug development is inherently risky, and many product candidates and investigational therapies fail during the development process.\n\nIn 2024, we continued to invest in and advance our R&amp;D pipeline across our therapeutic areas. Below is a summary of our product candidates that are in Phase 3 clinical trials or pending marketing authorization review by FDA or European Medicines Agency ('EMA').",

      "question": "How does Gilead's settlement related to bictegravir litigation impact both its financial obligations and product gross margin, and how does this align with the company's broader capital allocation strategy involving stock repurchases and dividends?",
      "answer": "Gilead incurred a $1.25 billion charge in 2021 related to the bictegravir litigation settlement, which directly reduced product gross margin from 81.2% in 2020 to 75.6% in 2021. This settlement is also reflected as a $1.25 billion accrued liability under 'Accrued and other current liabilities' as of December 31, 2021. Despite this significant expense, Gilead maintained its capital allocation strategy by continuing stock repurchases under the 2016 Program (8 million shares in 2021 for $546 million) and increasing its quarterly dividend from $0.71 to $0.73 per share in early 2022. This indicates that the company prioritizes returning capital to shareholders even in the face of major litigation-related costs, supported by its confidence in ongoing cash flows and capital resources.",

          "chunk_text": "In  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  our  Board  of  Directors  authorized  a  new  $5.0  billion  stock  repurchase  program  (the  '2020 Program'), which will commence upon the completion of the 2016 Program. Purchases under the 2020 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\n\nWe purchased 8 million and 22 million shares of our common stock under the 2016 Program for $546 million and $1.6 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the remaining authorized repurchase amount from both programs was $6.3 billion.\n\n## Dividends\n\nWe declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $3.6 billion or $2.84 per share of our common stock and $3.4 billion or $2.72 per share of our common stock in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend increase of 2.8% from $0.71 to $0.73 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 30, 2022 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2022. Future dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nWe believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\n- the commercial performance of our current and future products;\n- the progress and scope of our R&amp;D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n- the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;\n- the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;\n- the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;\n- the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;\n- debt service requirements;\n- the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and\n- costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation.\n\nWe may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\n\n## Material Cash Requirements\n\nWe continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital to ensure that we can adequately and efficiently finance our operations. As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements consisted primarily of the repayment of outstanding borrowings, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax from the Tax Cuts and  Jobs  Act,  our  settlement  related  to  bictegravir  litigation,  purchases  of  inventory,  operating  leases  obligations,  capital expenditures and milestone and other payments related to our collaborative agreements. See Notes 11. Collaborations and Other Arrangements, 12. Debt and Credit Facilities, 13. Leases, 14. Commitments and Contingencies and 18. Income Taxes of the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  additional  information.  We anticipate our cash requirements related to capital expenditures will increase in 2022 as compared to the prior year as we work to expand our site infrastructure and capabilities.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\n\nThe  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  is  based  on  our  Consolidated  Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.\n\nWe  believe  the  following  critical  accounting  policies  reflect  the  more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Product Gross Margin\n\nIn 2021, product gross margin decreased to 75.6% as compared to 81.2% in 2020, primarily due to a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation as well as an increase of $848 million in acquisition-related expenses from amortization of finite-lived intangible assets and recognition of inventory step-up charges primarily driven by our acquisitions of Immunomedics and  MYR. Product gross margin was also impacted by higher inventory write-down charges and changes in product mix. The increases were partially offset by lower royalty expenses due to lower sales of products containing emtricitabine and elvitegravir and  the  reversal  of  a  previously  recorded  $175  million  litigation  accrual  following  a  favorable  court  decision  related  to axicabtagene ciloleucel.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nR&amp;D expenses consist  primarily  of  clinical  studies  performed  by  contract  research  organizations,  materials  and  supplies, payments under collaborative and other arrangements including milestone payments, licenses and fees, expense reimbursements to the  collaboration  partners,  personnel  costs  including  salaries,  benefits  and  stock-based  compensation  expense,  and  overhead allocations consisting of various support and infrastructure costs.\n\nWe manage our R&amp;D expenses by identifying the R&amp;D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&amp;D projects based on unmet medical need and, as necessary, reallocate resources among our internal R&amp;D portfolio and external opportunities that we believe will best support the long-term growth of our business.\n\nIn 2021, R&amp;D expenses increased by $324 million compared to 2020, primarily due to the Arcus collaboration opt-in charge of $625 million, as well as higher investments in Trodelvy and magrolimab clinical activities. These increases were partially offset by  (i)  a  decline  of  approximately  $200  million  in  external  expenses  related  to  wind-down  or  completion  of  certain  remdesivir clinical studies, (ii) $190 million (\u20ac160 million) charge recorded in 2020 in connection with the agreement to amend the existing arrangement with Galapagos for the commercialization and development of Jyseleca, and (iii)  lower  stock-based  compensation expense.  R&amp;D  expenses  for  2020  included  accelerated  stock-based  compensation  expenses  of  $166  million  related  to  our acquisitions of Immunomedics and Forty Seven.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\n\nAcquired IPR&amp;D expenses reflect IPR&amp;D impairments as well as the initial costs of externally developed IPR&amp;D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront payments related to various collaborations and the initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects.\n\nAcquired  IPR&amp;D  expenses  of  $177  million  in  2021  were  related  to  licensing,  collaboration,  investment  and  other arrangements we entered into during the year. Acquired IPR&amp;D expenses of $5.9 billion in 2020 were primarily related to our acquisition  of  Forty  Seven  as  well  as  collaborations  and  other  investments  we  entered  into  during  the  year  with Arcus,  Pionyr, Tango, Tizona and Jounce.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSG&amp;A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities, including information technology investments. SG&amp;A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&amp;A expenses also include the Branded Prescription Drug ('BPD') fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are  required  to  pay  a  portion  of  the  BPD  fee,  which  is  estimated  based  on  select  government  sales  during  the  prior  year  as  a percentage of total industry government sales.",

The senior unsecured fixed rate notes also have a call feature, exercisable at our option, to  redeem the notes at par in whole, or in part, on dates ranging from one month to two years prior to maturity. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest is also required to be redeemed to the date of redemption. The $1.5 billion of 0.75% senior unsecured notes due September 2023 also have a call feature, exercisable at our option, to redeem the notes at par, in whole or in part, after September 2021.\n\nIn  the  event  of  the  occurrence  of  a  change  in  control  and  a  downgrade  in  the  rating  of  our  senior  unsecured  notes  below investment grade by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and S&amp;P Global Ratings, the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. We are required to comply with certain covenants under our note indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we were not in violation of any covenants.\n\nIn September 2020, we entered into a commitment letter with a group of institutional lenders to provide for a three-year senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. In October 2020, in connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (the 'Term Loan Facility') and borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. In 2021, we repaid $1.0 billion principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility which was due upon maturity in October 2023.\n\n## Liability Related to Future Royalties\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics, we assumed a liability related to a funding arrangement, which was originally  entered  into  by  Immunomedics  and  RPI,  prior  to  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics.  The  liability  related  to  future royalties  was  primarily  included  in  Long-term  debt,  net  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  See  Note  6.  Acquisitions  for additional information.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facilities\n\nIn June 2020, we terminated our $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021 (the '2016 Revolving Credit Facility') and entered into a new $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility maturing in June 2025 (the '2020 Revolving Credit  Facility').  The  2020  Revolving  Credit  Facility  can  be  used  for  working  capital  requirements  and  for  general  corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2020 Revolving Credit facility.\n\nThe 2020 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants. Loans under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility  bear  interest  at  either  (i)  the  Eurodollar  Rate  plus  the Applicable  Percentage,  or  (ii)  the  Base  Rate  plus  the Applicable Percentage, each as defined in the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility agreement. We may terminate or reduce the commitments, and may prepay any loans under the credit facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.\n\n## Contractual Maturities of Financing Obligations\n\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate future principal maturities of our senior unsecured notes as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Gilead's commercial investment in Trodelvy, as reflected in SG&A spending, align with its global regulatory approvals and the product's limited U.S. patent protection timeline?",
      "answer": "Gilead increased SG&A expenses in 2021 by $95 million compared to 2020, partly due to higher promotional and marketing activities driven by Trodelvy. This aligns with the global regulatory momentum of Trodelvy, which received approvals in multiple jurisdictions including the U.S., Canada, and the EU for metastatic TNBC and was also granted accelerated approval in the U.S. for urothelial cancer. However, Trodelvy's U.S. patent protection expires in 2023, which creates urgency in maximizing commercial returns through current marketing investments before potential generic competition.",

      "answer": "Gilead acquired Hepcludex through the purchase of MYR in Q1 2021 for \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.6 billion), with an additional contingent payment of up to \u20ac300 million tied to FDA approval, which was valued at $341 million at the acquisition date. The drug was conditionally approved by the EMA in July 2020 for chronic HDV treatment. Hepcludex was included in Gilead's reported revenue in 2022 alongside Hepsera. However, its U.S. and European patent expirations are set for 2030 and 2029 respectively, suggesting a limited exclusivity window compared to other portfolio products.

MYR focuses on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for the treatment of HDV. The acquisition provided Gilead with Hepcludex, which was conditionally approved by the European Medicines Agency ('EMA') in July 2020 for the treatment of chronic HDV infection in adults with compensated liver disease. Upon closing, MYR became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. The financial results  of  MYR  were  included  in  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  from  the  date  of  the  acquisition.  Acquisition-related expenses were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe aggregate consideration for this acquisition of \u20ac1.3 billion (or $1.6 billion) primarily consisted of \u20ac1.0 billion (or $1.2 billion)  paid  upon closing and contingent consideration of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, representing a potential future milestone payment upon FDA approval of Hepcludex. The fair value of this contingent liability, estimated using probability-weighted scenarios for FDA approval, was $341 million as of the acquisition date and was initially recorded in Other long-term obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the second quarter of 2021, the balance was reclassified to Accrued and  other  current  liabilities  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  this  contingent  liability  was $317 million as of December 31, 2021. The change in estimated fair value from the acquisition date was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange remeasurement.\n\nThe  acquisition  of  MYR  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination  using  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting.  This method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be generally recognized at fair value as of the acquisition  date.  The  fair  value  estimates  for  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  were  based  upon  valuations  using information known and knowable as of the date of this filing. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could cause an impact to the valuation of assets acquired, including intangible assets, goodwill and the related tax impacts of the acquisition, as well as legal and  other  contingencies.  The  amounts  recognized  will  be  finalized  as  the  information  necessary  to  complete  the  analysis  is obtained, but no later than one year after the acquisition date.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Januvia and Janumet sales across global markets in 2023 reconcile with their contribution to Merck's overall pharmaceutical segment performance and the strategic implications of patent expirations and regulatory challenges?",
      "answer": "In 2023, combined global sales of Januvia and Janumet declined by 25%, driven by the loss of exclusivity in Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Canada, as well as lower U.S. demand and pricing due to competitive pressures. Despite this, Januvia and Janumet still contributed $2,189 million (U.S.) and $1,039 million (International) in sales for Januvia, and $223 million (U.S.) and $954 million (International) for Janumet in 2023, according to the financial segment data. The U.S. patent for Januvia and Janumet expired in January 2023, but due to legal settlements, market exclusivity is expected to be maintained in the U.S. until May 2026 for Januvia and July 2026 for Janumet XR. However, the Company anticipates continued pricing and volume declines due to competitive pressures and the inclusion of Januvia in the IRA's price-setting program effective January 1, 2026. Additionally, nitrosamine contamination concerns led to quality control adjustments, though the company expects compliance with long-term regulatory limits moving forward. These factors collectively highlight the declining revenue trajectory of the diabetes franchise and the strategic importance of managing exclusivity timelines and regulatory risks.",

        "Hop 1: [MRK](page_126) \u2192 [Januvia]: Financial segment data shows Januvia contributed $2,189 million in total sales in 2023, with $1,151 million from the U.S. and $1,039 million internationally, indicating its material role in the pharmaceutical segment despite declining trends.",
        "Hop 2: [MRK](page_50) \u2192 [Januvia]: The Management Discussion highlights that lower sales of Januvia and Janumet were a key drag on overall sales growth in both the U.S. and international markets, offsetting gains in other therapeutic areas.",
        "Hop 3: [MRK](page_55) \u2192 [Januvia]: The detailed product discussion reveals that the decline in Januvia and Janumet sales was primarily due to patent expirations in key markets, regulatory scrutiny over nitrosamine contamination, and the looming impact of the IRA\u2019s price-setting program, all of which have strategic implications for Merck\u2019s diabetes portfolio."

      "answer": "Merck's financial treatment of Verquvo includes a $52 million intangible asset as of December 31, 2023, amortized through 2031 based on projected cash flows, which reflects its long-term commitment to the product. This aligns with the Bayer collaboration structure, where Merck receives a share of profits from Verquvo sales in Bayer's territories, contributing to 8% growth in alliance revenue in 2023. The final $400 million sales-based milestone payment to Bayer in 2022, partially attributed to Verquvo, underscores the financial incentives tied to the product\u2019s commercial success, supporting both its amortization profile and ongoing investment in the partnership.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Remicade's international sales in 2023 compare with its historical performance and its positioning within Merck's immunology portfolio?",
      "answer": "Remicade's international sales declined by 9% in 2023 to $187 million, continuing a downward trend from $207 million in 2022 and $299 million in 2021. This decline aligns with its positioning in Merck's immunology portfolio as a treatment for inflammatory diseases primarily marketed in Europe, Russia, and T\u00fcrkiye, where the product likely faces increasing competition and market saturation.",

        "Hop 1: [MRK](page_126) \u2192 [Remicade]: The international sales of Remicade dropped to $187 million in 2023, down from $207 million in 2022 and $299 million in 2021, indicating a consistent decline.",
        "Hop 2: [MRK](page_55) \u2192 [Remicade]: The 9% year-over-year decline in Remicade's sales in 2023 further confirms the product's weakening performance, with foreign exchange having a negligible impact on the change.",
        "Hop 3: [MRK](page_5) \u2192 [Remicade]: Remicade is positioned as a treatment for inflammatory diseases, primarily marketed in Europe, Russia, and T\u00fcrkiye, suggesting that the decline may be attributed to market-specific challenges in these regions."

      "question": "How do the financial performance, market dynamics, and strategic outlook for Janumet collectively reflect its role in Merck's overall revenue trends and challenges in 2023?",
      "answer": "Janumet's financial performance in 2023 showed a decline in sales, with total sales of $1,177 million, down from $1,700 million in 2022. This decline was driven by market exclusivity losses in Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Canada, as well as lower demand and pricing pressure in the U.S., as noted in the detailed product performance section. This drop in revenue contributed to the overall decline in the diabetes franchise, which offset growth in other areas like oncology and vaccines. Despite the expiration of the key U.S. patent for Januvia and Janumet in January 2023, Merck expects exclusivity to continue until May 2026 due to later-expiring salt-form patents, though the company anticipates continued pricing and volume pressure. The decline in Janumet sales, especially in international markets, played a significant role in the 1% international sales decline and partially offset strong U.S. growth driven by products like Keytruda and Vaxneuvance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK(page_126) \u2192 Janumet: Janumet generated $1,177 million in total sales in 2023, down from $1,700 million in 2022, reflecting a significant year-over-year decline.",
        "Hop 2: MRK(page_50) \u2192 Janumet: Janumet was specifically cited as a contributor to the decline in the diabetes franchise, which offset growth in other therapeutic areas and impacted both U.S. and international revenue.",
        "Hop 3: MRK(page_55) \u2192 Janumet: The decline in Janumet sales was attributed to loss of exclusivity in Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada, along with U.S. pricing pressure, and the product faces further challenges under the IRA\u2019s price-setting program starting in 2026."

      "question": "How does Amgen's financial treatment of its stake in BeiGene align with its strategic collaboration goals and equity investment accounting changes over time?",
      "answer": "Amgen initially acquired a 20.5% ownership interest in BeiGene for $2.8 billion in 2020 and accounted for it under the equity method. However, after relinquishing its right to appoint a director in early 2023, Amgen reclassified the investment to be carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings, recognizing unrealized gains of $82 million and $1.2 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. This shift in accounting treatment coincided with the broader strategic collaboration that began in 2020, under which Amgen and BeiGene jointly commercialize products like XGEVA, BLINCYTO, and KYPROLIS in China, sharing profits and losses equally during initial commercialization periods. The fair value of the investment stood at $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, indicating a positive financial alignment with the strategic partnership, which also includes joint R&D efforts capped at $1.25 billion in contributions from BeiGene.",

The fair values of our money market mutual funds and equity investments in publicly traded securities, including our equity investments in BeiG ene and Neumora, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, are based on quoted market prices in active markets, with no valuation adjustment .\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll of our foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P, Moody's or Fitch. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that uses an income-based industry-standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs, as applicable, include foreign currency exchange rates, SOFR, swap rates, obligor credit default swap rates and cross-currency basis swap spreads. Certain inputs, when applicable, are at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 19, Derivative instruments.\n\n## Contingent consideration obligations\n\nAs a result of our business acquisitions, we have incurred contingent consideration obligations as discussed below. The contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their fair values by using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, and we revalue these obligations each reporting period until the related contingencies have been resolved. The fair value measurements of these obligations are based on significant unobservable inputs related to licensing rights and product candidates acquired in business combinations, and they are reviewed quarterly by management in our R&amp;D and commercial sales organizations. The inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and the timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as estimated annual sales. Significant changes that increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related development, regulatory and commercial events or that shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events or that increase or decrease estimated annual sales would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the obligations, as applicable. Changes in the fair values of contingent consideration obligations are recognized in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.",

          "chunk_text": "## Equity securities\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% ownership interest in BeiG ene for $2.8 billion, substantially all of which was attributed to the fair value of equity securities, and we began using the equity method of accounting for this investment. Since the fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of BeiGene's underlying net assets, we began amortizing the intangible assets that gave rise to this basis difference over their useful lives.\n\nEffective  January 30, 2023, we relinquished our right to appoint a director to  BeiG ene's  Board of  Directors.  We no longer have the ability to exert significant influence over BeiG ene. As a result, in the first quarter of 2023, we began to account for our ownership interest as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value, which is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 18, Fair value measurement. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized unrealized gains of $82 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, in Other income (expense), net,  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. As  of  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  the  fair  values  of  our  investment  in  BeiG ene  were  $3.5  billion  and  $3.4  billion, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, under the equity method of accounting, the carrying value of the investment was reduced by our share of BeiG ene's net losses of $394 million and amortization of the basis difference of $190 million, with such amounts recognized in Other income (expense), net. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the carrying value increased by $11 million from the impact of other  BeiG ene ownership transactions.  For information on a collaboration agreement we entered into with BeiGene in connection with this investment, see Note 9, Collaborations.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions or otherwise agreed to by BeiG ene, while Amgen holds at least 5.0% of BeiG ene's outstanding common stock, (A) we may only sell our BeiGene equity investment via: (i) a registered public offering, (ii) a sale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the 'Securities Act') or (iii) a private sale ex empt from registration requirements under the Securities Act, and (B) we may not sell more than 5.0% of BeiGene's outstanding common stock in any rolling 12-month period.\n\n## Other equity securities\n\nExcluding  our  equity  investments  in  BeiG ene  (discussed  above)  and  Neumora  (discussed  below),  we  held  investments  in  other  equity  securities  with  readily determinable  fair  values  (publicly  traded  securities) of  $314  million  and $494  million  as  of  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  respectively,  which  are  included  in  Other noncurrent assets in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  For the years ended  December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net unrealized gains and losses on publicly traded securities resulted in a net loss of $21 million, a net gain of $98 million and a net loss of $165 million, respectively. Realized gains and losses on publicly traded securities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were not material.\n\nWe held investments of $319 million and $309 million in equity securities without readily determinable fair values as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are included in  Other  noncurrent  assets  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  For  the  years  ended December  31,  2024,  2023  and  2022,  gains  due  to  upward adjustments and gains realized upon dispositions of these securities were not material. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, downward adjustments were not material. For the year ended December 31, 2022, downward adjustments to the carrying values of these securities were $67 million. Adjustments were based on observable price transactions.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\n## Neumora Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our ownership interests in Neumora were approximately 21.9% and 23.2%, respectively, and the fair values of our investment were $375 million and $603 million, respectively, which are included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although our equity investment qualifies us for the equity method of accounting, we have elected the fair value option to account for our investment. See Note 18, Fair value measurement. Under the fair value option, changes in the fair value of the investment are recognized through earnings in Other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income each reporting period. We believe the fair value option best reflects the economics of the underlying transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized unrealized losses of $228 million and unrealized gains of $238 million and $105 million, respectively, for the change in fair values in Other income (ex pense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, Neumora released results of a Phase 3 study of navacaprant, and Neumora's stock price declined.",

In addition, we acquire product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic  position  within  our  industry  by  strengthening  and  diversifying  our  R&amp;D  capabilities,  product  pipeline  and  marketed-product  base.  These  arrangements generally provide for nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalties and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\n\nTrade  secret  protection  for  our  unpatented  confidential  and  proprietary  information  is  important  to  us.  To  protect  our  trade  secrets,  we  generally  require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of a business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\n\n## AstraZeneca plc\n\nWe are in a collaboration with AstraZeneca for the development and commercialization of TEZSPIRE. Under our collaboration, both companies share global costs, profits and losses equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca leads global development. In North America, Amgen, as the  principal,  recognizes  product  sales  of  TEZSPIRE  in  the  United  States,  and  AstraZeneca,  as  the  principal,  recognizes  product  sales  of  TEZSPIRE  in  Canada. AstraZeneca leads commercialization for TEZSPIRE outside North America. Amgen manufactures and supplies TEZSPIRE worldwide. 1\n\n## UCB\n\nWe are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of EVENITY . Under our collaboration, UCB has rights to lead commercialization for EVENITY in most countries in Europe. Amgen, as the principal, leads commercialization for EVENITY  and recognizes product sales in all other territories, including the United States. G lobal development costs and commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration are shared equally. Amgen manufactures and supplies EVENITY worldwide.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nIn January 2020, we acquired an equity stake in BeiG ene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. For  additional  information  regarding  our  equity  investment  in  BeiG ene,  see  Part  IV -Note  10,  Investments,  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Under  the collaboration, BeiG ene began selling XGEV A in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen would pay royalties to  BeiG ene on sales in  China of such products for a specified period. Amgen manufactures and supplies the collaboration products to BeiGene.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiG ene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash and development services of up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiG ene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiG ene will share profits and losses equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen also pays royalties to BeiGene.\n\nFor financial information about our significant collaborative arrangements, see Part IV-Note 9, Collaborations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe are also in a collaboration w ith AstraZeneca for the development of AMG  104.

In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies).\n\nTotal product sales increased 19% in 2024, primarily driven by volume growth of 23%, partially offset by declines in net selling price of 2%. U.S. volume grew 26% and ROW volume grew 17%. Product sales from acquired Horizon products contributed $4.2 billion in 2024 compared to $954 million in 2023, with volume growth of 11% from our other brands, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, BLINCYTO and Prolia.\n\nFor 2025, we expect volume growth from certain brands to be partially offset by net selling price declines. Further, the first quarter of a year historically represents the  lowest  product  sales  quarter  for  the  year,  in  part  due  to  plan  changes,  insurance  reverifications  and  higher  co-pay  ex penses  as  U.S.  patients  work  through deductibles, particularly for products acquired through pharmacy benefit programs.\n\nUncertain macroeconomic conditions, changes in the healthcare ecosystem and geopolitical conflicts have the potential to introduce variability into product sales. Furthermore, product sales continue to be impacted by actions from governments and other entities to curb high inflation, provisions of the IRA, inappropriate expanded utilization of the 340B Program and growth in numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\n\nOther revenues increased for 2024, primarily driven by higher corporate partner revenue from licensed products and royalty income.\n\nOperating expenses increased for 2024, driven by higher amortization expense from Horizon acquisition-related assets, higher R&amp;D and SG &amp;A expenses, including expenses from the acquired Horizon business, and higher profit share and royalty expense.",

      "answer": "Amgen's acquisition of Horizon involved $20.7 billion in fair value assigned to developed-product-technology rights and IPR&D, amortized over 10 years, while the ChemoCentryx acquisition allocated $3.5 billion to developed-product-technology rights tied specifically to TAVNEOS, amortized over 11 years. The Horizon acquisition included a broader basket of rights and was valued significantly higher, reflecting a larger strategic bet on a portfolio of marketed products and R&D assets. In contrast, the ChemoCentryx acquisition focused on a single approved product, TAVNEOS, with a more targeted valuation and amortization. Both assets are amortized using the straight-line method, indicating a consistent accounting policy, but the difference in scale and scope highlights Amgen's diversified M&A strategy\u2014pursuing both broad platform acquisitions and focused therapeutic bets.",

The estimated fair value of $3.5 billion was determined by using a multi-period ex cess earnings income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value by applying a discount rate that represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets.

The inventory fair value adjustment was amortized as inventory turned over, which we estimated to be approximately 13 months from the acquisition date.\n\nA net deferred tax liability of $502 million was recognized on the temporary differences related to the book bases and tax bases of the acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities, primarily driven by the intangible assets acquired.\n\nThe excess of the acquisition date consideration over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of $649 million was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes.

Upon closing of this transaction, net assets related to Gensenta of $86 million were divested, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a loss on divestiture of $567 million recorded in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, primarily due to the reclassification of $615 million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses from AOCI into earnings.

      "question": "How does Abbott's use of interest rate hedge contracts, including their impact on interest expense, fair value disclosures, and overall debt management strategy, reflect the company's approach to mitigating interest rate risk across its fixed-rate debt portfolio?",
      "answer": "Abbott uses interest rate hedge contracts to convert portions of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to interest rate fluctuations. In 2023, interest expense, net, decreased to $252 million, partly due to the favorable impact of higher interest rates on interest income, but this was offset by the negative impact of interest rate hedge contracts tied to fixed-rate debt. Abbott held approximately $2.2 billion in interest rate contracts as of December 31, 2023, which are designated as fair value hedges. These contracts adjust the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in long-term benchmark rates, with the carrying value of the debt adjusted accordingly. The fair value of these contracts showed a payable position of $95 million in 2023, down from $156 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in the liability associated with these hedges. This suggests that Abbott actively manages its interest rate exposure through derivative instruments, aligning its debt structure with market conditions.",

      "answer": "Abbott acquired CSI for $851 million in cash on April 27, 2023, which reflects a significant capital outlay included in the company's working capital changes, alongside dividends, debt repayment, and share repurchases. The acquisition was allocated to two non-deductible developed technology intangible assets totaling $305 million, $15 million in in-process R&D (classified as an indefinite-lived intangible), and $371 million in non-deductible goodwill, indicating a strong emphasis on future innovation and synergy realization. In the Vascular segment, the acquisition directly contributed to the 9.3% sales increase in 2023 (excluding foreign exchange), showing that CSI's atherectomy system has already begun to complement Abbott\u2019s existing vascular device portfolio and drive growth.",

      "question": "How does Abbott's quantitative exposure to foreign currency forward exchange contracts in 2023, as reflected in their fair value and notional amounts, align with their stated hedging strategies and the recognition of gains or losses in income for those contracts?",
      "answer": "Abbott held foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a gross notional amount of $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, to hedge exposures related to foreign currency denominated payables, receivables, and intercompany loans. These contracts had a net fair value of $(62) million, with a receivable position of $169 million and a payable position of $(231) million. The gains or losses from these contracts are recognized in income as part of cash flow hedges, with the accumulated gains or losses included in Cost of Products Sold when the underlying hedged transactions occur, typically within the next twelve to eighteen months. This aligns with the company's broader strategy of managing currency risk through fair value and cash flow hedge accounting, as disclosed in the derivative activity table and related income statement reclassifications.",

      "answer": "Abbott\u2019s new Five Year Credit Agreement, entered into on January 29, 2024, supports its short-term liquidity needs by providing $5 billion in unsecured credit capacity without any outstanding borrowings at termination of the prior agreement, aligning with its recent repayments of $1.05 billion and $1.2 billion in 2023. The agreement also reflects a long-term debt strategy by offering flexible interest rate options tied to Abbott\u2019s credit ratings, which remain strong at AA- (S&P) and Aa3 (Moody\u2019s), ensuring favorable borrowing terms through 2029.",

        "Hop 1: [ABT](page_91) \u2192 [Five Year Credit Agreement]: The new Five Year Credit Agreement is listed in the exhibit table as dated January 29, 2024, among Abbott, various financial institutions, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., indicating its formal documentation and legal structure.",
        "Hop 2: [ABT](page_62) \u2192 [Five Year Credit Agreement]: Abbott terminated its 2020 Five Year Credit Agreement and entered into the new agreement on January 29, 2024, which provides up to $5 billion in unsecured credit capacity, with no borrowings outstanding at termination, supporting short-term liquidity flexibility.",
        "Hop 3: [ABT](page_38) \u2192 [Five Year Credit Agreement]: Abbott\u2019s debt and capital section notes the new agreement as part of its readily available financial resources and highlights its investment-grade credit ratings (AA- by S&P and Aa3 by Moody\u2019s), which underpin favorable borrowing terms and long-term financial stability."

      "question": "What are the implications of Danaher's acquisition of Abcam plc on its internal control over financial reporting, considering the scope of the acquisition, its exclusion from the audit, and the financial materiality of the transaction?",
      "answer": "Danaher's acquisition of Abcam plc for $5.6 billion on December 6, 2023, introduced a significant new entity into its consolidated financial structure, constituting 8% of total assets as of December 31, 2023, and contributing less than 1% of revenues for the year. However, due to the timing of the acquisition, Abcam was excluded from both management's and the auditor's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of year-end. This exclusion raises potential concerns about the completeness of the internal control evaluation, especially given the financial materiality of Abcam\u2019s assets. While the auditor confirmed the overall effectiveness of Danaher\u2019s internal controls, the lack of evaluation of Abcam\u2019s controls introduces a gap in assurance that could affect the integrity of the consolidated financial statements until full integration is achieved.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DHR(page_58) \u2192 Abcam plc: Management excluded Abcam from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting due to incomplete integration, despite Abcam representing 8% of total assets and less than 1% of revenues as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: DHR(page_59) \u2192 Abcam plc: The independent auditor also did not evaluate Abcam\u2019s internal controls, despite affirming the overall effectiveness of Danaher\u2019s controls, highlighting a gap in assurance for a material portion of the consolidated entity.",
        "Hop 3: DHR(page_72) \u2192 Abcam plc: Abcam was acquired for $5.6 billion, described as a leading global supplier of protein consumables, and is expected to contribute strategically to Danaher\u2019s life sciences portfolio, underscoring its financial and operational significance."

      "question": "How does Danaher's classification of Japan, Australia, and New Zealand as 'Other Developed Markets' inform both its global workforce distribution and its geographic sales breakdown in the Diagnostics segment?",
      "answer": "Danaher defines 'Other Developed Markets' as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, which directly informs how the company categorizes these regions in both workforce planning and sales reporting. In terms of workforce, approximately 3,000 employees were located in these markets as of the end of 2023, indicating a relatively small but likely specialized presence. In the Diagnostics segment, these markets accounted for 5% of total 2023 sales, showing that while they are part of the developed market category, their contribution to revenue is modest compared to North America (47%) and high-growth markets (32%). This suggests a strategic balance between maintaining a presence in mature, stable markets and focusing growth efforts in regions with higher expansion potential.",

        "Hop 3: [DHR](page_9) \u2192 [Other Developed Markets]: Notes that the Diagnostics segment generated 5% of its 2023 sales in these markets, placing them in the broader context of the company's geographic revenue distribution."

      "question": "How does Danaher's acquisition of Abcam for $5.6 billion, which added proteomics capabilities to the Life Sciences segment, reconcile with the segment's core sales performance in 2023 and the impact of acquisition-related costs on operating profit margins?",
      "answer": "Danaher acquired Abcam for $5.6 billion in December 2023, adding proteomics capabilities to its Life Sciences segment. However, Life Sciences core sales in 2023 were mixed, with growth in Western Europe and China offset by declines in North America, particularly in the genomic medicines business due to reduced demand for COVID-19-related products. Despite the strategic addition of Abcam, the Life Sciences segment's operating profit margin was negatively impacted by 130 basis points due to acquisition-related transaction costs, settlement of pre-acquisition share-based payment awards, and fair value adjustments to inventory associated with the Abcam acquisition. This indicates that while the acquisition positions the segment for future growth, it introduced near-term margin pressure and operational complexity.",

      "question": "How does the financial impact of the Aldevron acquisition on DHR's balance sheet compare with its operational impact on cost of sales and gross margin trends, particularly in light of the inventory charges and goodwill recorded?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of Aldevron significantly impacted DHR's balance sheet, with $6.1 billion in goodwill and $3.5 billion in other intangible assets recorded (page 73), and $9,584 million in net assets acquired (page 74). Operationally, the acquisition initially increased cost of sales by $59 million in 2021 due to fair value adjustments to inventory (page 46), which contributed to gross margin pressures. Despite these upfront costs, the acquisition was positioned to provide long-term sales and earnings opportunities by expanding product offerings in genomic medicine. However, in 2023, reduced demand led to $87 million in inventory-related charges, indicating continued integration and market demand challenges.",

In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $99 million and debt discounts totaled $37 million, which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nAbbVie used the net proceeds received from the issuance of the notes to finance the acquisition of ImmunoGen, repay its term-loan, repay commercial paper borrowings, pay fees and expenses in respect of the foregoing, finance general corporate purposes and, together with cash on hand, fund AbbVie's acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics. See Note 5 for additional information.\n\nIn December 2023, AbbVie entered into a $9.0 billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and $5.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement. In February 2024, AbbVie borrowed and repaid $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement. Interest charged on this borrowing was based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate Reference Rate (SOFR) +0.975% with an effective interest rate of 6.29%. Subsequent to the $15.0 billion issuance of senior notes, AbbVie terminated both the bridge and term loan credit agreements in the first quarter of 2024. In February 2024, concurrent with the ImmunoGen acquisition, the company assumed and repaid an ImmunoGen senior secured term loan at a fair value of $99 million.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, the company assumed $345 million aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2027. Upon acquisition, the convertible senior notes became callable and note holders could redeem the convertible senior notes for cash at a premium. As of the acquisition date, the convertible senior notes were recognized as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets at an aggregate fair value of $400 million. Following the acquisition date, the company repaid the convertible senior notes and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\n\nThe company also assumed funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition. Under the agreements, Cerevel Therapeutics received funding to support development of tavapadon and agreed to repay regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties contingent upon approval of tavapadon by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, upon acquisition the company has the option to satisfy payment obligations early by making a payment equal to the amount of funding provided to Cerevel Therapeutics plus a variable premium. In all circumstances, total repayments under the funding agreements will not exceed $531 million in aggregate. The funding agreements were accounted for as financing arrangements and the fair value of the related financing liability was $246 million as of the acquisition date.

          "chunk_text": "## A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products.\n\nAbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. Such disputes could result in AbbVie's loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of AbbVie's commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.\n\n## Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\nThe successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and current governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. As a result, manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics-including Humira, Skyrizi, Botox and Creon -could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\n## New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.\n\nAbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that research, develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie's products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. In addition, as AbbVie products lose exclusivity, competition surrounding such products will increase and generic and biosimilar products will increasingly penetrate the markets. Furthermore, consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, have lower prices or better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, or have superior performance features than AbbVie's products, and this may negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\n## The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process requiring critical environmental controls, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer.\n\nThe manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, labor shortages, supply chain disruption, pandemics, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, such batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, ti me and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\n\n17\n\n",

      "answer": "AbbVie's effective tax rate in 2024 was influenced by the U.S. Global Minimum Tax, which contributed to a deviation from the statutory rate, while the company's accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign-sourced earnings dictates that such tax will be recognized as a period expense in the year incurred. This policy aligns with the broader impact of international tax changes, including the transition in Puerto Rico from an excise tax to an income-based tax system, which resulted in a $323 million net tax benefit in 2022 due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

      "answer": "CVS uses actuarial principles to estimate IBNR liabilities, relying heavily on assumptions such as completion factors and health care cost trend rates. At December 31, 2021, the IBNR liability was $6.6 billion out of $8.8 billion in health care costs payable. Completion factors are derived from historical claim submission and processing patterns, and a 13 basis point variation could impact liabilities by \u00b1$186 million. Similarly, a \u00b13.5% change in assumed health care cost trend rates could affect liabilities by \u00b1$450 million. These assumptions are tested during audits through sensitivity analyses and third-party comparisons, with controls in place to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Historically, completion factors have varied by 21 basis points (2021) and 4 basis points (2020), resulting in adjustments of $207 million and $35 million, respectively, while recent health care cost trends showed a 5.0% and 4.0% decrease in 2021 and 2020, leading to reductions of $581 million and $394 million in health care costs payable.

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's annual goodwill impairment review process, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above. To test the estimated fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions to the reporting unit's historical results and third-party industry data. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the key assumptions. We involved valuation specialists to assist in our assessment of the methodology and significant assumptions (such as the discount rate) used by the Company. In addition, we tested management's reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. |\n| Description of the Matter                | At December 31, 2021, the incurred but not reported ('IBNR') liabilities represented $6.6 billion of $8.8 billion of health care costs payable. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's liability for health care costs payable includes estimated payments for (1) services rendered to members but not yet reported and (2) claims that have been reported but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, 'IBNR'). The estimated IBNR liability is developed utilizing actuarial principles and assumptions that include historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, historical and assumed medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors to record the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable.

          "chunk_text": "## Recoverability of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.\n\nThe indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the Company. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\n## Health Care Costs Payable\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, 75% and 77% respectively, of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to the Company's Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid (collectively, 'IBNR'). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. The remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. See Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company's reserving methodology.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. After considering the claims paid in 2021 and 2020 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 21 and 4 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $207 million and $35 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to the prior year. The Company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of IBNR as of December 31, 2021. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company's estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 13 basis points from the Company's assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus $186 million pretax.\n\nAlso during 2021 and 2020, the Company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated. Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2021 and 2020 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed health care costs that were 5.0% and 4.0% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of $581 million and $394 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.\n\nManagement considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2021, the Company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 1.8% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. Health care cost trend rates during the past two years have been impacted by utilization changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact has not been uniform, with products and select geographies experiencing utilization impacts due to COVID-19 waves. Based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company's estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $450 million pretax.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Such adjustments are recorded in the period",

Management fees charged to contract holders are included in services revenue and recognized over the period earned.\n\n## Health Care Costs Payable\n\nHealth care costs payable consist principally of unpaid fee-for-service medical, dental and pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing arrangements related to the Health Care Benefits segment's Insured Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products and accruals for state assessments. Unpaid health care claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company's Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, 'IBNR'). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Such estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, assumed and historical medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in Insured membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company reflects changes in these estimates in benefit costs in the Company's consolidated operating results in the period they are determined. Capitation costs represent contractual monthly fees paid to participating physicians and other medical providers for providing medical care, regardless of the volume of medical services provided to the Insured member. Amounts due under risksharing arrangements are based on the terms of the underlying contracts with the providers and consider claims experience under the contracts through the financial statement date.\n\nThe Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. Of those factors, the Company considers the analysis of historical and projected claim payment patterns (including claims submission and processing patterns) and the assumed health care cost trend rate (the year-over-year change in per member per month health care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. In developing its IBNR estimate, the Company consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company's estimate of IBNR in 2021.\n\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to estimate 'completion factors.' The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents the Company's estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company's health care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company's completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\n\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\n\nThe Company's health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such services. Many factors influence the health care cost trend rate, including the Company's ability to manage benefit costs through product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs, as well as the mix of the Company's business. The health status of the Company's Insured members, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per member utilization and unit costs.

      "question": "How does CVS's use of the market multiple method in valuing reporting units for goodwill impairment relate to both the $431 million LTC goodwill impairment in 2021 and the $1.4 billion store impairment charge in the Retail/LTC segment, and what does this reveal about the company's asset valuation methodology under financial stress?",
      "answer": "CVS uses the market multiple method in conjunction with the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. In 2021, this combined approach led to a $431 million goodwill impairment charge for the LTC reporting unit, as its carrying value exceeded its fair value due to declining occupancy rates and the prolonged impact of the pandemic. Simultaneously, the Retail/LTC segment also recorded a $1.4 billion impairment charge related to store closures and strategic realignment, which involved valuing long-lived assets using discounted future cash flow estimates. The parallel use of the market multiple method for goodwill and discounted cash flow for tangible assets highlights a consistent but differentiated valuation framework across asset types under financial stress, where external market signals influence goodwill assessments while internal cash flow expectations drive impairment of physical assets.",

Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets could, in the future, become impaired.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $108.1 billion and $110.7 billion, respectively, of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nEstimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, mortgage loans, alternative investments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.\n\nThe global capital markets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser extent the international financial markets; and volatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments' monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:\n\n- significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders' equity;\n- keeping interest rates low on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities (such as we have experienced during recent years) and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities;\n- reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;\n- causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, mortgage borrowers and/or reinsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;\n- making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for example if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-toperiod volatility in our net income and shareholders' equity;",

          "chunk_text": "\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by the divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business, partially offset by goodwill associated with immaterial acquisitions. See Note 2 ''Divestitures'' for further discussion regarding the Workers' Compensation business divestiture.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date.\n\nDuring 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the Company's ability to grow the LTC reporting unit's business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company's long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. As of December 31, 2021, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company also performed an impairment test of the intangible assets of the LTC reporting unit and concluded these assets were not impaired. As of December 31, 2021, there was $2.7 billion of intangible assets related to customer lists in the LTC reporting unit.",

Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\n\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n\n## Long-Lived Asset Impairment\n\n## Recoverability of Definite-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group's carrying value that exceeds the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nThe long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group's future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to continue to drive higher engagement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on November 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation (the 'Board') authorized the closing of approximately 900 stores over the next three years. The Company expects to close approximately 300 stores each year between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores' asset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. A long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups were lower than their respective carrying values. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of a write down of approximately $1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million related to property and equipment, within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\nThere were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded store impairment charges of $231 million, primarily related to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges.\n\n## Recoverability of Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit's fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.",

See Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' for additional information regarding the valuation of cost method investments.\n\n## Separate Accounts Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\nSeparate Accounts assets relate to the Company's large case pensions products which represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders. Since contract holders bear the investment risk of these assets, a corresponding Separate Accounts liability has been established equal to the assets. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income and capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets accrue directly to such contract holders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company's other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity or cash flows.\n\nSeparate Accounts assets include debt and equity securities. The valuation methodologies used for these assets are similar to the methodologies described above in this Note 4 ''Fair Value.'' Separate Accounts assets also include investments in common/collective trusts that are carried at fair value. Common/collective trusts invest in other investment funds otherwise known as the underlying funds. The Separate Accounts' interests in the common/collective trust funds are based on the fair values of the investments of the underlying funds and therefore are classified in Level 2. The assets in the underlying funds primarily consist of equity securities. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued at their respective net asset value ('NAV') per share/unit on the valuation date.",

The Company entered into these contracts to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss which in turn reduces the Company's capital and surplus requirements. Total deposit assets and liabilities related to reinsurance agreements that do not qualify for reinsurance accounting under GAAP were not material as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## 16. Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe Company has the following significant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2021:\n\n- ASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The banks maintain accounts to fund claims of the Company's ASC customers. The customer is responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day. In these arrangements, the Company guarantees that the banks will not sustain losses if the responsible ASC customer does not properly fund its account. The aggregate maximum exposure under these arrangements is generally limited to $250 million. The Company can limit its exposure to these guarantees by suspending the payment of claims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded the amount paid by the bank.\n- Separate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent funds maintained as a contractual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations underlying the guaranteed benefits in these Separate Accounts were approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' for additional information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and mortality risk and are required to maintain Separate Accounts balances at or above a specified level. The level of required funds is a function of the risk underlying the Separate Account's investment strategy. If contract holders do not maintain the required level of Separate Accounts assets to meet the annuity guarantees, the Company would",

      "question": "How has CVS's exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities evolved in terms of unrealized losses, fair value, and maturity distribution as of December 31, 2021, and how does this reflect both short-term and long-term risk positioning in their investment portfolio?",
      "answer": "As of December 31, 2021, CVS's exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) totaled $574 million in fair value, with $12 million in unrealized losses. Of this, $6 million in fair value was maturing in less than 12 months with no unrealized losses, while $568 million was maturing beyond 12 months, carrying $12 million in unrealized losses. This exposure was part of a larger debt securities portfolio valued at $7,384 million, where CMBS represented approximately 7.8% of total debt securities by fair value and contributed significantly to unrealized losses at 11.3%. The maturity distribution indicates that the majority of the CMBS holdings were longer-dated, suggesting a strategic positioning toward holding these assets over the medium to long term, despite the unrealized losses. This aligns with the overall portfolio structure, where the majority of unrealized losses were concentrated in longer-duration assets, signaling a potential tolerance for short-term volatility in exchange for longer-term yield.",

      "question": "How does Abbott's use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage exposure on $14.1 billion in long-term debt as of December 31, 2024, align with the $2.2 billion notional value of these contracts and the impact on the fair value of debt, and how is this hedging activity reflected in both the balance sheet and risk disclosures?",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Financial Instruments and Risk Management\n\n## Market Price Sensitive Investments\n\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $10 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2024 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $313 million and $314 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Non-Publicly Traded E quity Securities\n\nAbbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $91 million and $88 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $20 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling $2.2 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of longterm debt at December 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $13.7 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.8% and 3.6% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,  respectively)  with  maturities  through  2046.  At  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  the  fair  value  of  current  and  long-term  investment  securities  amounted  to approximately $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\n\n## Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the  variability  of  the  cash  flows  due  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates  and  are  marked-to-market  with  the  resulting  gains  or  losses  reflected  in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). G ains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held $7.0 billion and $7.3 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2024 will mature in 2025 or 2026 depending on the contract.

The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held $16.2 billion and $13.8 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts, which mature within 13 months.\n\nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $583 million and $419 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.

      "answer": "Abbott utilizes a yen-denominated term loan of $583 million as a designated hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries, reflecting a strategic approach to managing foreign exchange exposure (page_63).

Additionally, in 2024, Abbott modified the original yen-denominated loan, increasing the principal from \u00a559.8 billion to \u00a592.0 billion and extending the maturity to 2029, which demonstrates a proactive restructuring of its debt portfolio to maintain long-term financial flexibility while supporting its hedging strategy (page_37).",

The decrease in Net cash from operating activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the decline in operating earnings and increased payments related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by lower expenditures for inventory and lower cash payments for income taxes due to lower earnings.\n\nA substantial portion of Abbott's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024, is held by Abbott affiliates outside of the U.S. If these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds.\n\nAbbott funded $349 million in 2024 and 2023, and $413 million in 2022 to defined benefit pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding of approximately $302 million  in  2025  for  its  pension  plans. Abbott  ex pects  annual  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  to  continue  to  ex ceed Abbott's  capital  ex penditures  and  cash dividends.\n\n## Debt and Capital\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Abbott's long-term debt rating was AA- by S&amp;P G lobal Ratings and Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating.\n\nAbbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. On January 29, 2024, Abbott terminated its 2020 Five Y ear Credit Agreement (2020 Agreement) and entered into a new Five Y ear Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement). There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2020 Agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on January 29, 2029 and will bear interest, at Abbott's option, based on either a base rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus an applicable margin based on Abbott's credit ratings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Abbott's total debt outstanding was $14.1 billion, of which approximately $1.5 billion will mature in 2025. On June 26, 2024, Abbott modified its ex isting, yen-denominated 5-year term loan scheduled to mature in November 2024. The amended terms include a net increase in principal debt from \u00a559.8 billion to \u00a592.0 billion, with a new maturity date in June 2029. The modified, 5-year term loan bears interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. The net proceeds equated to approximately $201 million. The \u00a592.0 billion loan is designated as a hedge of Abbott's net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.\n\nOn November 19, 2024, Abbott repaid the \u20ac590 million outstanding principal amount of its 0.10% Notes upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $640 million. On November 30, 2023, Abbott repaid the $1.05 billion outstanding principal amount of its 3.40% Notes upon maturity. On September 27, 2023, Abbott repaid the \u20ac1.14 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.875% Notes upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $1.2 billion. In September 2023, Abbott repaid approximately $197 million of debt assumed as part of a recent business acquisition.\n\nOn October 11, 2024, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7 billion of Abbott common shares, from time to time (the \"2024 repurchase program\"). The 2024 repurchase program is in addition to the unused portion of the 2021 repurchase program, which the board of directors approved in December 2021 and authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Abbott's common shares from time to time. As of December 31, 2024, $293 million remains available for repurchase under the 2021 repurchase program. In 2024 and 2023, Abbott repurchased approximately 10.2 million and 9.8 million, respectively, of its common shares for $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, under the 2021 repurchase program. In 2022, Abbott repurchased 32.3 million of its common shares for $3.7 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the October 2019 share repurchase program, and a portion of the 2021 repurchase program.",

      "question": "How does Abbott's use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge cash flow variability align with the fair value changes recognized in other comprehensive income and the notional value trends reported in the market risk disclosures?",
      "answer": "Abbott utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge cash flow variability associated with anticipated intercompany purchases and foreign currency exposures. In 2024, the company reported a $347 million gain in other comprehensive income from these contracts designated as cash flow hedges, which is expected to be reclassified into income over the next 12 to 18 months, primarily impacting the 'Cost of products sold.' This aligns with the $7.0 billion notional value of such contracts reported in the market risk disclosures, indicating a significant hedge program in place to manage exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, the fair value of these contracts at year-end 2024 was $390 million (receivable position) and $(131) million (payable position), showing a net positive exposure that reflects the overall effectiveness and strategic positioning of the hedging program.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Financial Instruments and Risk Management\n\n## Market Price Sensitive Investments\n\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $10 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2024 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $313 million and $314 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Non-Publicly Traded E quity Securities\n\nAbbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $91 million and $88 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $20 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling $2.2 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of longterm debt at December 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $13.7 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.8% and 3.6% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,  respectively)  with  maturities  through  2046.  At  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  the  fair  value  of  current  and  long-term  investment  securities  amounted  to approximately $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\n\n## Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the  variability  of  the  cash  flows  due  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates  and  are  marked-to-market  with  the  resulting  gains  or  losses  reflected  in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). G ains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held $7.0 billion and $7.3 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2024 will mature in 2025 or 2026 depending on the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2023 matured in 2024 or will mature in 2025 depending upon the contract.\n\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held $16.2 billion and $13.8 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts, which mature within 13 months.\n\nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $583 million and $419 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt is due to net incremental borrowing of $201 million, discussed in Note 10 - Debt and Lines of Credit, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\n\n.",

      "question": "How does Abbott's evolving financial treatment and disclosure of its TCJA-related transition tax obligation reflect both its current tax liabilities and its strategic positioning of foreign earnings reinvestment?",
      "answer": "Abbott's TCJA-related transition tax obligation decreased from $430 million in 2023 to $210 million in 2024 as disclosed in the footnotes (page 55), reflecting partial resolution or revaluation of prior liabilities. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining balance of the transition tax obligation stands at $432 million, to be paid over the next two years (pages 33 and 71). Meanwhile, Abbott continues to assert that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested, despite the restructuring of foreign affiliates that led to a $7.5 billion non-cash valuation allowance adjustment in 2024 (pages 33 and 71), suggesting improved profitability in foreign jurisdictions. This combination of decreasing transition tax liability and strategic reinvestment of foreign earnings indicates a shift in Abbott's global tax positioning, balancing ongoing resolution of TCJA obligations with a renewed confidence in foreign affiliate profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest E xpense and Interest (Income)\n\nInterest ex pense, net decreased from $252 million in 2023 to $215 million in 2024. Interest ex pense decreased in 2024 due to the repayment of approximately $2.25 billion of long-term debt in September and November of 2023, partially offset by a reduction in interest income due to lower average cash and short-term investment balances versus the prior year. Interest expense, net decreased $123 million in 2023 due to the favorable impact of higher interest rates on interest income, partially offset by the negative impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fix ed-rate debt.\n\n## Other (Income) Expense, net\n\nOther income, net was $376 million of income in 2024, $479 million of income in 2023 and $321 million of income in 2022. Other income, net includes income of approximately $542 million, $498 million, and $406 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. The decrease in 2024 reflects the recognition of a $143 million loss on the sale of a non-core business related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. The decrease in 2024 was partially offset by an increase in income associated with the nonservice cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. In 2023, Other income, net included equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $39 million, as well as income from a $42 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to previous business acquisitions.\n\n## Taxes on Earnings\n\nTaxes on earnings reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.\n\nTaxes on earnings include approximately $50 million, $22 million and $43 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result of the resolution of various tax  positions related to prior years, tax es on earnings in 2024, 2023 and 2022 also include approx imately $25 million, $80 million and $20 million of net tax  ex pense, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2024, tax es on earnings includes $7.5 billion in non-cash valuation allowance adjustments resulting from the restructuring of certain foreign affiliates and the confirmation of certain tax filing positions. The restructuring improved profitability  to  several  of Abbott's  affiliates  and  management  concluded  that  the  related  preex isting  deferred  tax   assets,  which  historically  had  a  full  valuation allowance, were more likely than not to be realizable in future periods.  In particular, Abbott considered the likelihood of sustained ongoing profitability of the affiliates as a positive factor that outweighed all available negative evidence considered. Accordingly, Abbott released the full valuation allowance on such deferred tax assets and recorded the offset to tax  ex pense.\n\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) includes a one-time transition tax that is based on Abbott's total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&amp;P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&amp;P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining balance of Abbott's transition tax obligation related to the TCJA is approximately $432 million, which will be paid over the next two years as allowed by the TCJA. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable.\n\nIn the U.S., Abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  for  the  2019  Federal  tax   year  in  the  amount  of  $417  million.  The  primary  adjustments  proposed  in  the  SNOD  relate  to  the reallocation of income between Abbott's U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2023.\n\nIn June 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years in the amount of $192 million. The matters proposed in the 2017/2018 SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2019 SNOD. Abbott filed a petition in September 2024 with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2017/2018 SNOD in a manner consistent with its petition for the 2019 SNOD.",

      "question": "How has the financial impact of Medical Device Regulations on Medtronic\u2019s income evolved across fiscal years 2020\u20132022, and what does this suggest about the company's regulatory cost management and tax adjustments over time?",
      "answer": "The financial impact of Medical Device Regulations on Medtronic increased steadily from $48 million in fiscal year 2020 to $83 million in 2021 and then to $102 million in 2022. Additionally, the associated tax adjustments rose from $15 million in 2021 to $16 million in 2022, indicating a growing regulatory burden. This trend suggests that Medtronic has faced increasing compliance costs related to medical device regulations, which have also influenced its non-GAAP adjustments and effective tax rates over time.",

At April 30, 2021 the estimated fair value was $28.6 billion compared to a principal value of $26.5 billion. The fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the publicly registered Senior Notes, which are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values and principal values consider the terms of the related debt and exclude the impacts of debt discounts and hedging activity.\n\n## 7. Derivatives and Currency Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company uses operational and economic hedges, including currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Company uses  cross  currency  interest  rate  swaps  to  manage  currency  risk  related  to  certain  debt.  In  order  to  minimize  earnings  and  cash  flow volatility  resulting  from  currency exchange rate changes, the Company enters into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate",

      "answer": "Medtronic's Diabetes Operating Unit experienced a revenue decline from $1,171 million in fiscal year 2021 to $974 million in fiscal year 2022, indicating a downward trend in financial performance for this segment. This unit specifically derives revenue from products like insulin pumps, which are covered under the company's broader indemnification and warranty obligations outlined in the financial statements. These obligations include potential liabilities for claims related to product injury, property damage, or patent infringement, with the company noting that while the ultimate resolution of these guarantees is not expected to be material, the exposure cannot be estimated. Thus, despite the financial performance challenges in the Diabetes segment, the company maintains a general risk posture that applies across all product lines, including insulin pumps, without quantifying specific segment-level liability risks.",

The  Company  also  offers  warranties  on  various  products.  The Company's  maximum  exposure  under  these  guarantees  is  unable  to  be  estimated.  Historically,  the  Company  has  not  experienced significant losses on these types of guarantees.\n\nThe  Company  believes  the  ultimate  resolution  of  the  above  guarantees  is  not  expected  to  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company's consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\n\n## 19. Segment and Geographic Information\n\nThere were no changes to the reportable segments during the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022. The Company's four principal operating and reportable segments are as follows: Cardiovascular Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit.\n\nThe Company's management has chosen to organize the entity based upon therapy solutions provided by each segment. The four principal segments are strategic  businesses  that  are  managed  separately,  as  each  one  develops  and  manufactures  products  and  provides  services oriented toward targeted therapy solutions.\n\nThe  primary  products  and  services  from  which  the  Cardiovascular  Portfolio  segment  derives  its  revenues  include  products  for  the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiac rhythm disorders and cardiovascular disease, as well as services to diagnose, treat, and manage heart and vascular-related disorders and diseases.\n\nThe  primary  products  and  services  from  which  the  Medical  Surgical  Portfolio  segment  derives  its  revenues  include  those  focused  on diseases  of  the  respiratory  system,  gastrointestinal  tract,  renal  system,  lungs,  pelvic  region,  kidneys,  obesity,  and  other  preventable complications.\n\nThe  primary  products  and  services  from  which  the  Neuroscience  Portfolio  segment  derives  its  revenues  include  those  focused  on neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, as well as various areas of the spine and brain, along with pelvic health and conditions of the ear, nose, and throat.\n\nThe  primary  products  from  which  the  Diabetes  Operating  Unit  segment  derives  its  revenues  include  those  focused  on  diabetes management, including insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring systems, smart insulin pens, and insulin pump consumables.\n\nSegment disclosures are on a performance basis, consistent with internal management reporting. Net sales of the Company's segments include  end-customer  revenues  from  the  sale  of  products  the  segment  develops,  manufactures,  and  distributes.  Refer  to  Note  2  for discussion  on  net  sales  by  segment.  There  are  certain  corporate  and  centralized  expenses  that  are  not  allocated  to  the  segments.  The Company's management evaluates the performance of the  segments  and  allocates  resources  based  on  net  sales  and  segment  operating profit.  Segment  operating  profit  represents  income  before  income  taxes,  excluding  interest  expense,  amortization  of  intangible  assets, centralized  distribution  costs,  non-operating  income  or  expense  items,  certain  corporate  charges,  and  other  items  not  allocated  to  the segments.",

      "answer": "Medtronic notes on page 17 that they have historically lost and may again lose market share due to product problems, physician advisories, and safety alerts, which underscores the importance of product quality and efficacy. On page 22, the company acknowledges that quality problems could lead to recalls or safety alerts, which could damage their reputation, reduce customer trust, and result in declining revenue. Page 14 provides historical context, indicating that major market share shifts have occurred due to safety alerts and product issues, reinforcing the sensitivity of Medtronic\u2019s competitive position to product quality and safety. Together, these sections show that safety alerts not only pose a direct reputational and operational risk but also have historically and potentially significantly influenced Medtronic's competitive standing and market performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBoard of Directors, and information concerning our executive officers, directors and Board committees (including committee charters) is available  through  our  website  at  www.medtronic.com  under  the  'Our  Company  -  Governance'  caption.  Information  relating  to transactions  in  Medtronic  securities  by  directors  and  officers  is  available  through  our  website  at  www.medtronic.com  under  the  'Our Company - Investors' caption and the 'Financials - SEC Filings' subcaption.\n\nOur website and the information contained on or connected to our website are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\n\nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC. The public may obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. We file annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the SEC under the Exchange Act.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed below. Each of the following risks should be carefully considered, together with all the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  related  notes  and  in  our  other  filings  with  the  SEC.  Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties.\n\n## Business and Operational Risks\n\n## We operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively.\n\nWe compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small, specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, technologies, or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products  less  competitive.  In  addition,  we  face  competition  from  providers  of  alternative  medical  therapies,  such  as  pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWe believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\n- product performance and reliability,\n- product technology and innovation,\n- product quality and safety,\n- breadth of product lines,\n- product support services,\n- customer support,\n- cost-effectiveness and price,\n- reimbursement approval from healthcare insurance providers, and\n- changes to the regulatory environment.\n\nCompetition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies. From time to time we have lost, and may in the future lose, market share in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts and publications about our products, which highlights the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems to our business. In the current environment of managed care, consolidation among healthcare providers,  increased  competition,  declining  reimbursement  rates,  and  national  and  provincial  tender  pricing,  as  recently  experienced  in China, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our success. Further, our continued growth and success depend on our ability to  develop,  acquire  and  market  new  and  differentiated  products,  technologies  and  intellectual  property,  and  as  a  result  we  also  face competition for marketing, distribution, and collaborative development agreements, establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create, invest in or acquire advanced  technology,  incorporate  this  technology  into  our  proprietary  products,  obtain  regulatory  approvals  in  a  timely  manner,  and manufacture and successfully market our products. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success.",

In  addition,  any  public  announcements  related  to  litigation  or administrative proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nWhile we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets or agreements  (such  as  employee,  non-disclosure  and  non-competition  agreements)  may  not  adequately  protect  our  intellectual  property. Further, pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or too limited in scope to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage. In addition, our patents will expire over time, our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain, and infringement may go undetected. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. In addition, license agreements could be terminated. We also rely  on  non-disclosure  and  non-competition  agreements  with  certain  employees,  consultants  and  other  parties  to  protect,  in  part,  trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.\n\nIn addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market or manufacture some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that substantially mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\n## Quality problems could lead to recalls or safety alerts, product liability claims, reputational harm, adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the impact on patients, and the serious and potentially costly consequences of adverse product performance. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some  of  the  medical  devices  we  manufacture  and  sell  are  designed  to  be  implanted  in  the  human  body  for  long  periods  of  time  or indefinitely.  Component  failures,  manufacturing  nonconformances,  design  defects,  off-label  use,  or  inadequate  disclosure  of  productrelated risks or product-related information with respect to our products, if they were to occur, could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions, which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Due to the strong name recognition of the Medtronic brand, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in diminished market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future. Further, we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed, manufactured and/or marketed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and unpredictable or accelerated changes in demand for certain of our products in connection with COVID-19 and its related impacts could impact development and production of products and services and could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or related claims, as well as adversely impact our customer relationships and reputation.\n\nStrong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could  decline.  Our  success  also  can  depend  on  our  ability  to  manufacture  to  exact  specification  precision-engineered  components, subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation, competitive advantage and market share could be harmed. In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall  of  products  or  temporarily  shut  down  production  lines  based  on  performance  relative  to  our  own  internal  safety  and  quality monitoring and testing data.\n\nAny of the foregoing problems, including future product liability claims or recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Healthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be actions and proposals by several governments, regulators and third-party payers globally, including the U.S. federal and state governments, to control these costs and, more generally, to reform healthcare systems. Certain of these actions and proposals, among other things, limit the prices we are able to charge for  our  products  or  the  amounts  of  reimbursement  available  for  our  products  and  could  limit  the  acceptance  and  availability  of  our products. These actions and proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",

In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole.\n\nWe  operate  in  an  industry  characterized  by  extensive  patent  litigation.  Patent  litigation  may  result  in  significant  damage  awards  and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.\n\n## Sales and Distribution\n\nWe sell  our  medical  devices  and  therapies  through  a  combination  of  direct  sales  representatives  and  independent  distributors  globally. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. Our medical supply products are used primarily in hospitals, surgical centers, and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our four largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, China, and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain underpenetrated.\n\nOur marketing and sales strategy is  focused  on  rapid,  cost-effective  delivery  of  high-quality  products  to  a  diverse  group  of  customers worldwide. To achieve this objective, our marketing and sales teams are organized around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products.\n\nWe are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.\n\n## Competition, Industry, and Cost Containment\n\nWe compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products. In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.\n\nMajor shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, results of clinical  trials  to  support  superiority  claims,  and  publications  about  our  products,  reflecting  the  importance  of  product  quality,  product efficacy  and  quality  systems  in  the  medical  device  industry.  In  the  current  environment  of  managed  care,  economically  motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, declining reimbursement rates, and national and provincial tender pricing, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our business. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products.\n\nGovernment and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These initiatives put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms. Hospitals, which purchase our technology, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, centralized purchasing, and in some cases, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests  with  physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization. This has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products.\n\n## Production and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nWe  manufacture  products  at  manufacturing  facilities  located  in  various  countries  throughout  the  world.  We  purchase  many  of  the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw  materials  are  available  only  from  a  sole  supplier.  We  work  closely  with  our  suppliers  to  help  ensure  continuity  of  supply  while maintaining high quality and reliability. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components.",

      "answer": "Thermo Fisher utilizes cross-currency interest rate swaps as part of its strategy to hedge net investments in foreign operations against adverse exchange rate movements, as noted in the Derivative Contracts section. These swaps, along with foreign currency-denominated debt and payables, result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses and fair value changes that are recorded in the currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive items. In 2023, the company recorded a $222 million loss in the currency translation adjustment related to these swaps, reflecting the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, the Fair Value Hedging Relationships table shows that in 2023, cross-currency interest rate swaps contributed $120 million to interest expense and a $222 million loss in other comprehensive items, aligning with the company\u2019s stated objective of managing foreign exchange exposure through economic hedging.",

      "answer": "TMO reports $306 million in insurance contracts as part of its non-U.S. pension plan assets on page 57, where these contracts are classified under Level 2 (based on significant other observable inputs). On page 68, insurance contracts are again categorized under Level 2 but appear in a broader context of financial assets, valued at $162 million, indicating a different allocation depending on the asset pool. Page 67 explains that insurance contracts are among the financial instruments valued using the market approach, which relies on observable market inputs. The consistent Level 2 classification across sections suggests that TMO uses market-corroborated inputs for valuation, while their strategic role appears to be focused on managing pension liabilities, particularly in non-U.S. jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does BMY's strategic focus on long-term growth in hematological malignancies align with the market exclusivity outlook for Pomalyst and its specialized distribution model?",
      "answer": "BMY's strategic focus on long-term growth in hematology, particularly in multiple myeloma, is challenged by the limited market exclusivity outlook for Pomalyst, which only extends to 2024 in the EU with no minimum exclusivity date listed in the U.S. or Japan. Despite this, the company maintains a specialized distribution model for Pomalyst through mandatory REMS programs in the U.S. and internationally, which helps ensure appropriate use and potentially extends commercial viability. This alignment reflects BMY's broader strategy of leveraging differentiated research platforms and maintaining disciplined business development to offset the impact of current and future patent expiries, including those of Pomalyst.",

      "question": "Given BMY's strategic focus on pipeline diversification and mitigating the impact of patent expiries, how does the market exclusivity outlook for Revlimid (particularly in the U.S. and EU) intersect with the company's reliance on this product for revenue and its broader risk management approach?",
      "answer": "BMY acknowledges its reliance on Revlimid as one of its key revenue-generating products, which makes the loss of market exclusivity a significant financial risk (page_31). However, the company is actively working to offset the impact of current and future patent expiries, including for Revlimid and Pomalyst, by strengthening its pipeline and expanding therapeutic offerings (page_43). Despite this strategic pivot, Revlimid's market exclusivity dates are listed as '^^' in both the U.S. and EU (page_8), suggesting limited remaining protection or ongoing uncertainty, which heightens the urgency for BMY to execute its pipeline-driven growth strategy effectively.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [BMY](page_43) \u2192 [Revlimid]: BMY highlights its focus on mitigating the impact of patent expiries, specifically naming Revlimid and Pomalyst as key products affected, and emphasizes pipeline expansion as a countermeasure.",
        "Hop 2: [BMY](page_31) \u2192 [Revlimid]: BMY explicitly states that Revlimid is one of its key products responsible for a majority of revenues, earnings, and cash flows, making its market exclusivity status a critical risk factor.",
        "Hop 3: [BMY](page_8) \u2192 [Revlimid]: In the market exclusivity table, Revlimid's U.S. and EU exclusivity dates are marked as '^^', indicating either expired protection or lack of clarity, which aligns with the risk and strategic urgency expressed in other sections."

      "answer": "The March 2023 EC approval of Sotyktu for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis directly supports BMY's strategic focus on strengthening its presence in immunology, particularly in dermatology, as outlined in the strategy section. This approval also contributes to the company\u2019s broader pipeline expansion goal of growing the registrational portfolio from six to up to twelve potentially first-in-class or best-in-class assets. Additionally, the approval exemplifies BMY\u2019s execution of its pipeline and commercial strategy, as highlighted in the MD&A section, which emphasizes geographic and therapeutic diversification to support long-term growth.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's 2020 Stock Incentive Plan supports its executive compensation strategy by offering a range of award structures, including restricted stock units (RSUs), nonqualified stock options, and performance-based RSUs, as evidenced by the multiple forms listed in the exhibits (e.g., 2024 and 2023 versions). As of December 31, 2024, the plan had 48 million shares available for future grants, indicating sufficient capacity to continue aligning executive incentives with long-term shareholder value.

      "question": "How does UnitedHealth Group's strategic emphasis on in-home care as part of value-based care delivery align with its Medicare Advantage product enhancements and the financial impact of care pattern shifts observed in 2024?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's strategic emphasis on in-home care is a core component of its value-based care delivery model, as highlighted in the 'Delivery System and Payment Modernization' section, where it is positioned as a way to improve care quality, patient experience, and cost efficiency. This is exemplified by the expansion of in-home and virtual care offerings through Optum Health, which is seen as a growth opportunity. In alignment with this strategy, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has actively enhanced its offerings to include more digital and physical care resources in the home, such as the HouseCalls program, which conducted 2.9 million clinical preventive home care visits in 2024. However, this strategic push faces financial headwinds from observed care pattern shifts, including increased hospital coding intensity and high-cost medication prescriptions in response to the Inflation Reduction Act, which are expected to persist and contribute to rising medical cost trends. These cost pressures, combined with the $640 million in medical costs incurred due to the temporary suspension of care management activities from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, create a complex financial environment in which the company must balance its investment in in-home care with cost containment and profitability goals.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Business Trends\n\nOur businesses participate in the United States and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.\n\nPricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of ex pected future costs, including medical care patterns, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.\n\nThe commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.\n\nMedicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in 'Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties' and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in 'Medical Cost Trends.' Our 2025 benefit design approach contemplates these trends.\n\nIn Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.\n\nMedical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. As ex pected and contemplated in our benefits design, we have continued to observe increased care patterns, which may continue in future periods. We also observed an upshift in hospital coding intensity and an acceleration in the prescribing of certain high-cost medications in early response to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). We expect these additional factors to continue into future periods. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.\n\nAs a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, we incurred medical costs related to the impact of the temporary suspension of some care management activities, impacting our UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health businesses, to help care providers with their workflow processes. Early in the second quarter we resumed these activities. For the year ended December 31, 2024, medical costs related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities were approximately $640 million.\n\nMedicaid Redeterminations. Medicaid redeterminations have impacted the number of people served through our Medicaid offerings, partially offset by an increase in consumers served through our commercial offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people and families have continued access to care. The Medicaid redetermination process has also caused a timing mismatch between the current health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates, which remained well short of current care activity. We expect this gap between people's health status and rates will narrow in 2025.\n\nDelivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in-clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration.\n\nThis trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. A key focus of our future growth is to accelerate the transition from fee-for-service care delivery and payment models to fully accountable value-based care. This transition requires initial costs such as system enhancements, integrated care coordination technology, physician training and clinical engagement. Enhanced clinical engagement is a critical step to improving the ex perience and health outcomes of the people we serve and should result in lower costs to the overall health system over time.",

These financial impacts align with the broader risk factors outlined in the government program section, which highlight exposure to unpredictable funding changes, contract termination risks, and performance-based payment adjustments like the Medicare Advantage star rating system. The company's mitigation strategies, such as cost management and benefit adjustments, are referenced in both the risk and segment sections, but the continued exposure to CMS benchmark changes and audit-related recoupments remains a systemic risk.",

Some of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, has affected and in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate are generally subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage (such as Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in certain states), reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in, or prevent our ex pansion into, certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For ex ample, CMS in the past has reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid programs. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. Chronic failure to meet the benchmarks could result in termination of these government contracts. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submissions by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting specified quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to maintain or improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet evolving government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or ex clusion from these or other government programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding and adjust monthly capitation payments for Medicare programs. For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Medical Care Services Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR) using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of actual care activity, and processing cycles.\n\nWe identified medical care services IBNR as a critical audit matter because it requires significant management assumptions in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's methods, assumptions, and judgments in developing estimates for medical care services IBNR.",

For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments are measured at fair value, with certain exceptions where the Company has elected to measure investments with unobservable inputs at cost, subject to fair value adjustments upon an impairment or a transaction of the same or similar security. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the ex tent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nIn July 2024, the Company amended its Medicare Supplement Program with a membership organization (the Medicare Supplement Program). The amendments provide the Company the right to use a trade name and other intellectual property in marketing efforts for Medicare Supplement offerings. Amounts previously reported as assets under management are now included within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet based upon their classification.\n\nFor periods prior to the amended Medicare Supplement Program, the Company excluded the effects of certain balance sheet amounts in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while these effects are included for periods after the amendments.\n\n## Other Current Receivables\n\nOther current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company.",

In June 2024, our Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 35 million shares of Common Stock, in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board's 2018 renewal of the program. As of December 31, 2024, we had Board of Directors' authorization to purchase up to 33 million shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nDividends. In June 2024, our Board of Directors increased the Company's quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $8.40 compared to $7.52 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nPending Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, ex cluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $4 billion.\n\nWe do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\n\n## Medical Costs Payable\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service.\n\nIn each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $700 million, $840 million and $410 million, respectively.\n\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.\n\nCompletion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical ex perience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group utilizes the market-based method as part of its quantitative goodwill impairment testing, which involves selecting a peer group to derive market multiples for estimating reporting unit fair values (page_41). This method is weighted alongside discounted cash flow analyses that rely heavily on financial projections such as revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs, as well as subjective discount rate assumptions (page_45). Despite the sensitivity of these fair value estimates to key assumptions, UnitedHealth reported no goodwill impairment for the years 2019 through 2021 (page_54), suggesting that the fair values of reporting units consistently exceeded their carrying values, even under varying market and financial conditions.",

If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units' operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates, cash flow projections and peer company multiples to analyze the potential for a material impact. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate peer group whose securities are traded on an active market. The peer group is used to derive market multiples to estimate fair value. As of October 1, 2021, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.\n\n## LEGAL MATTERS\n\nA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\n\nInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2021, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.\n\n## ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $25 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2021, $7 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.\n\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, $37 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $45 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.\n\nWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.",

As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company performs an annual impairment test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill. The estimates of the reporting unit fair values are calculated using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs as well as discount rates. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate group of peer companies whose securities are traded on an active market. The annual impairment test indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values as of the impairment testing date; therefore, no impairment was recognized.\n\nWe identified a critical audit matter related to the quantitative analysis performed for such reporting units because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This required increased auditor judgment and extent of effort, including involvement of fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to peer company selection and financial projections, which can be impacted by regulatory and macro-economic factors.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation, business, and market assumptions including the discount rate, financial forecasts, and peer group used by management to estimate the fair value of reporting units where a quantitative analysis was performed, included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's annual goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the determination of the fair value such as controls related to management's financial forecasts, as well as controls over the selection of discount rates, company specific risks, peer companies, and market multiples.\n- We evaluated management's ability to forecast and meet future revenue, medical cost trend, and operating costs by comparing:\n- Actual results to historical forecasts.\n- Forecasted information to: internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, industry and economic trends, and analyst reports of revenue and earnings expectations for the Company and its peers.\n- We evaluated the impact of changes in management's forecasts from the October 1, 2021 annual measurement date to December 31, 2021.\n- We evaluated management's selection of peer companies and market multiples.\n- With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of (1) the valuation methodologies, including testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, (2) the weighting of such valuation methodologies, and (3) discount rate and company specific risks by:\n- Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n- Developing a range of independent discount rate estimates and comparing to those selected by management.\n\n## /S/ DELOITTE &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 15, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term.\n\nThe Company's ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors.

The company applies these factors differently depending on the reporting period, using them directly for periods older than two months. The independent auditor identified the incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liability, which heavily relies on completion factors, as a critical audit matter due to the significant management judgment involved.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and finance committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements.\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December 31, 2021 the Company's IBNR balance was $17 billion. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of claim levels, processing cycles, and consideration of COVID-19.\n\nWe identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmodels consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Judgments related to these factors contemplated the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments.\n\nInvestments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company's investment policy.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nThe Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products.\n\nPursuant to the Company's agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company's general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company's discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities.",

      "question": "How does UnitedHealth Group's financial performance in 2021 reflect the growth and cost dynamics of its Medicare Advantage business, particularly in light of its operational expansion, member growth, and the impact of external factors like the repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the pandemic?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's Medicare Advantage business contributed significantly to revenue growth in 2021, driven by an increase in the number of individuals served, which reached 6.5 million as of year-end. This growth was partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax, which reduced premium revenues. Additionally, the business faced increased medical costs due to higher utilization, including from the pandemic, which raised the Medical Care Ratio (MCR). Despite these cost pressures, temporary care deferrals and cost management initiatives helped mitigate earnings pressure, allowing the company to maintain operational growth.",

Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans.\n\nUnitedHealthcare's revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations decreased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses.\n\n## Optum\n\nTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows:\n\n## Optum Health\n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based arrangements, acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to the factors impacting revenues as well as cost management initiatives and increased investment income. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our value-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners.

Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives.\n\n## Optum Rx\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and cost management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition to the factors contributing to revenue growth, adjusted scripts also increased due to the dispensing of COVID-19 vaccines.",

UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement offerings include care management and health system navigator services, clinical management programs, nurse health line services, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients, including AARP, the nation's largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S. government agencies. Products are also offered through agents, employer groups and digital channels.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement's major product categories include:\n\nMedicare Advantage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, PrivateFee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account consumer and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement served 6.5 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2021.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement's senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. We have continued to enhance our offerings, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our concierge navigation services and enabling the home as a safe and effective setting of care. For example, through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed more than 2.1 million clinical preventive home care visits in 2021 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. Our Navigate4Me program provides a single point of contact and a direct line of support for individuals as they go through their health care experiences. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software and digital therapeutics for remote monitoring enabling clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information bridging capabilities across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and enable care managers to create individualized care plans to help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time.\n\nMedicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people's needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2021, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.5 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 3.7 million individuals in stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.\n\nMedicare Supplement. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement is currently serving 4.4 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare program.\n\nPremium revenues from CMS represented 36% of UnitedHealth Group's total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement.\n\n## UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State\n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State is dedicated to serving state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program.

      "answer": "Empliciti, a humanized monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma, is subject to market exclusivity risks outlined in BMY's regulatory discussion on biologics. According to the 10-K, biologic products like Empliciti receive 12 years of regulatory data protection in the U.S., but the filing of biosimilar applications can occur as early as four years after approval, potentially leading to earlier market entry pressures. Empliciti\u2019s revenue declined from $381 million in 2020 to $334 million in 2021, suggesting emerging competitive or market access challenges. This decline may be an early indicator of such pressures, especially given the competitive landscape in the multiple myeloma treatment space, where other therapies like Revlimid and Pomalyst/Imnovid dominate with significantly higher revenues.

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "answer": "Orencia's December 2021 FDA approval for aGvHD initiates a 12-year regulatory data protection period under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, meaning biosimilar versions of Orencia cannot be approved until at least December 2033. This significantly extends BMY's revenue protection window for Orencia, particularly in a new high-potential indication. Notably, this approval coincided with several other key biologics approvals for BMY in late 2021, including multiple indications for Opdivo and Zeposia, suggesting a coordinated regulatory strategy to maximize market exclusivity periods across its biologics portfolio just as some older products approach potential biosimilar competition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "answer": "BMY's 10-K filing indicates that Yervoy, as a biologic, is subject to increasing risks from biosimilar competition due to evolving regulatory frameworks and patent challenges (page 9). Despite these risks, Yervoy generated $2,026 million in 2021, showing strong revenue growth (page 110). This growth is attributed to increased demand, particularly in combination with Opdivo for indications like NSCLC, which aligns with BMY's strategic emphasis on combination therapies to drive both U.S. and international revenue (page 71). The interplay between regulatory risk, revenue performance, and therapeutic positioning suggests a dual focus on leveraging Yervoy\u2019s current market exclusivity while maximizing its commercial value through strategic combinations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "answer": "BMY faces increased regulatory and intellectual property risk for Opdivo, as outlined in the biologics section (page 9), where the 12-year U.S. data protection period and biosimilar approval pathway pose a threat to long-term exclusivity. Despite this, Opdivo received multiple global approvals in 2021 (page 64), including for advanced RCC and gastric cancers, which underscores its strategic importance. However, as noted in the risk factors (page 34), the withdrawal of the HCC indication\u2014granted under accelerated approval in 2017\u2014demonstrates the vulnerability of maintaining indications without confirmatory trial success, highlighting the tension between expanding Opdivo's use and sustaining its commercial viability amid regulatory scrutiny and biosimilar pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

          "chunk_text": "regard to the distribution of drugs under the 340B program, or any material changes in our U.S. payer channel mix, could have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  revenues  and  profitability.  In  addition,  if  we  are  required  to  pay  penalties  under  the applicable regulations, there would be an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\n\nWe may experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products. Our ability to replace  revenue  from  products  that  lose  patent  protection  is  directly  dependent  on  our  ability  to  successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner.\n\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, BMS expects that sales of its key brand products like Revlimid, Pomalyst, Sprycel and Abraxane will decline after the loss of market exclusivity for such products. Consequently, our future success is  highly  dependent  on  our  pipeline  of  new  products.  There  is  a  high  rate  of  failure  inherent  in  the  research  and development process for new drugs. As a result, there is a high risk that funds we invest in research programs will not generate financial returns. Compounds or products may appear promising in development but fail to reach market within the expected or optimal timeframe, or at all. For example, in November 2021, the FDA extended its review of our NDA for mavacamten and announced a new PDUFA action date of April 28, 2022; the FDA had earlier set a PDUFA action date of January 28, 2022.\n\nIn  addition,  product  extensions  or  additional  indications  may  not  be  approved.  Furthermore,  products  or  indications approved under the U.S. FDA's Accelerated Approval Program may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies and such studies may not be successful. For example, in July 2021, we announced that we voluntarily withdrew from the U.S. market the indication for Opdivo (nivolumab) as a single agent for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were previously treated with sorafenib. Opdivo was granted this indication in 2017  under  the  U.S.  FDA's  accelerated  approval  program.  Our  action  to  withdraw  the  indication  was  taken  in consultation with the U.S. FDA in accordance with its standard procedures for evaluating accelerated approvals that have not met their post-marketing requirements and as part of a broader industry-wide evaluation.\n\nDeveloping  and  commercializing  new  compounds  and  products  involve  inherent  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  (i) efficacy  and  safety  concerns  or  findings  of  superior  safety  or  efficacy  of  competing  products;  (ii)  delayed  or  denied regulatory approvals, including as a result of difficulties in enrolling patients and completing clinical trials in a timely manner;  (iii)  delays  or  challenges  with  producing  products  on  a  commercial  scale  or  excessive  costs  to  manufacture products; (iv) failure to enter into or implement optimal alliances for the development and/or commercialization of new products; (v) changes in regulatory approval processes which may cause delays or denials of new product approvals; (vi) preclusion from commercialization due to intellectual property issues or disputes with third parties; and (vii) failure in certain markets to obtain reimbursement commensurate with the level of innovation and clinical benefit presented by the product.\n\nWe are also unable to predict if and when any changes to laws or regulatory policies will occur and how they will affect our  business  and  particularly  our  pipeline  of  new  products.  For  example,  in  the  U.S.,  a  partial  federal  government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019. Any extended government shutdown could result in reductions or delays of U.S. FDA's activities, including with respect to  our  ongoing clinical  programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals.\n\nRegulatory approval delays are especially common when a product is expected to have a REMS program, as required by the  U.S.  FDA  to  address  significant  risk/benefit  issues,  and  we  expect  that  certain  of  our  future  key  products  will  be distributed in the U.S. primarily through a REMS program. The inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay  in  the  expected  approval  and  related  launch  date  of  a  new  product  could  negatively  impact  our  revenues  and earnings. In addition, if certain acquired pipeline programs are canceled or we believe their commercial prospects have been reduced, we may recognize material non-cash impairment charges for those programs. Finally, losing key molecules and intermediaries or our compound library through a natural or man-made disaster or act of sabotage could negatively impact the product development cycle.\n\nWe can provide no assurance when or whether any of our products under development will be approved or launched or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful. We must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short term or long term can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects.\n\nThe public announcement of data from our clinical studies, or those of our competitors, or news of any developments related to our, or our competitors', products or late-stage compounds may cause significant volatility in our stock price and  depending  on  the  data,  may  result  in  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  or  results  of operations.

As a CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy, it was positioned to treat several aggressive B-cell malignancies. Despite these approvals, Breyanzi contributed only $87 million in revenue in 2021, significantly lower than other established products like Opdivo ($7,523 million) or Revlimid ($12,821 million). This suggests that while Breyanzi has strong regulatory and therapeutic positioning, its market adoption was still in early stages in 2021, likely due to the complexity and cost of CAR T-cell therapies, limited patient eligibility, and competitive dynamics in the oncology space.",

      "answer": "Amgen's initial $2.8 billion equity investment in BeiGene in 2020, which was accounted for under the equity method before transitioning to a fair value method in Q1 2023, reflects a shift in Amgen's influence and strategic alignment with BeiGene. The collaboration agreement, as amended multiple times (including in January 2023), outlines joint development and commercialization rights in China for key oncology products like XGEVA, BLINCYTO, and KYPROLIS, with profit-sharing and eventual royalty structures. This evolving relationship, marked by a $1.2 billion unrealized gain in 2023 and a relinquished board appointment right, suggests a transition from active operational influence to a more financially oriented stake, while maintaining strategic product rights and development partnerships.",

      "question": "How does Amgen's financial commitment to Teneobio through contingent milestone payments align with the strategic value of the acquired R&D technology rights and the company's broader partnership framework?",
      "answer": "Amgen's upfront payment of $993 million and potential future milestone payments of up to $1.6 billion to Teneobio's former equity holders reflect a high-stakes bet on the development success of AMG 340 and other drug candidates. However, the fair value of those contingent obligations was estimated at $299 million at acquisition, indicating a probability-weighted and risk-adjusted view of the future payouts. On the asset side, Amgen recognized $115 million in R&D technology rights tied to Teneobio\u2019s proprietary bispecific and multispecific antibody platforms, which are being amortized over 10 years. These rights, along with other intangibles, were valued using a multi-period excess earnings model, suggesting long-term strategic value in Teneobio\u2019s technology beyond any single drug candidate. The inclusion of 'Teneobio' in the glossary further signals its importance as a key partner in Amgen\u2019s innovation ecosystem, even though AMG 340 was terminated in Q3 2023.

Amgen's collaboration with Kyowa Kirin positions Amgen to lead global development, manufacturing, and commercialization outside Japan, while Kyowa Kirin has co-promotion rights in the U.S. and opt-in rights in other markets. However, since Rocatinlimab is still in development for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, Amgen must advance the drug through clinical trials and regulatory approvals before fully capitalizing on this exclusivity period.",

      "question": "How does Pfizer's historical treatment and estimation of revenue deductions, including the impact of the pandemic and product-specific rebates, align with their detailed accounting policies and the sensitivity of estimates across different markets and programs?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's discussion of revenue deductions shows a consistent framework for estimating deductions such as rebates, chargebacks, and returns, while highlighting variations in sensitivity depending on the market and program. On page 42, Pfizer notes that while overall adjustments to revenue deductions have historically been less than 1% of revenues, product-specific rebates can significantly impact year-over-year revenue growth trends. This aligns with the detailed accounting policies on page 69, which describe how deductions are estimated and recorded in the same period as revenue recognition, with particular emphasis on the sensitivity of U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates due to extensive time delays. Additionally, page 38 discusses the pandemic's impact on product demand, such as disruptions to healthcare activity affecting the Prevnar family and the influence of postponements in elective procedures on Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, which indirectly affects revenue deductions through changes in utilization patterns. Together, these perspectives reveal a nuanced approach where Pfizer balances historical accuracy with the need for dynamic adjustments in response to external factors like the pandemic and market-specific conditions.",

The relatively flat operational performance was primarily driven by growth from Eliquis, the Prevnar family, Ibrance and Zavicefta, offset by lower revenues for Consumer Healthcare, reflecting the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction.\n\n## Revenue Deductions\n\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues.

          "chunk_text": "as well as COVID-19 vaccine and oral COVID-19 treatment supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. We are focused on all aspects of our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible, including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial, manufacturing, R&amp;D and corporate enabling functions globally.\n\nApart from our introduction of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and Paxlovid, our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways. Our portfolio of products experienced varying impacts from the pandemic in 2021. For example, certain of our vaccines such as the Prevnar family were impacted by disruptions to healthcare activity related to COVID-19, including the prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19. For some products such as Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, we continued to see postponement of elective and diagnostic procedures in 2021 due to COVID-19, which may subside in 2022 as COVID-19 vaccination and booster rates continue to increase and/or if COVID-19 cases subside. On the other hand, some products such as Ibrance saw accelerating demand in 2021 as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic show signs of recovery across several international markets. For detail on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our products, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income-Revenues by Geography and Revenues-Selected Product Discussion sections within this MD&amp;A.\n\nIn 2021, engagement with healthcare professionals started to return to pre-pandemic levels and we continue to review and assess epidemiological data to inform in-person engagements with healthcare professionals and to help ensure the safety of our colleagues, customers and communities. As part of our commitment to engaging our customers in the manner they prefer, we are also taking a hybrid approach of virtual and in person engagements and saw customer response to both approaches. During the pandemic, we adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information, including increasing the scale of our remote engagement. Most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to temporarily work remotely, while certain colleagues in the PGS and WRDM organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission. As of December 31, 2021, more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been fully vaccinated or received an approved exception. Also, in 2021 and to date, we have not seen a significant disruption to our supply chain, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. However, we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials potentially constraining available supply, which could have a future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. Certain of our clinical trials were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, which included, in some cases, challenges related to recruiting clinical trial participants and accruing cases in certain studies. Our clinical trials also progressed in this challenging environment through innovation, such as decentralized visits (e.g., telemedicine and home visits) to accommodate participants' ability to maintain scheduled visits, as well as working with suppliers to manage the shortage of certain clinical supplies.\n\nWe will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. Future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business, operations or financial condition and results. If we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains or significant disruptions in clinical trials or other operations, or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results.\n\nFor additional information, please see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-COVID-19 Pandemic section of this Form 10-K.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nFollowing is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. Also, see Note 1D .\n\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 . Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments: Acquisitions ( Note 1E ); Fair Value ( Note 1F ); Revenues ( Note 1H ); Asset Impairments ( Note 1M ); Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies ( Note 1Q ); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans ( Note 1R ); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies ( Note 1S ).\n\nFor a discussion of a recently adopted accounting standard and a change in accounting principle related to our pension and postretirement plans, see Notes 1B and 1C.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. For further detail on acquisition accounting, see Note 1E . Historically, intangible assets have been the most significant fair values within our business combinations. For further information on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, see Asset Impairments below.\n\n## Revenues\n\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n30",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n\n## G. Foreign Currency Translation\n\nFor most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net , and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.\n\n## H. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable\n\nRevenue Recognition --We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer.\n\nOur Sales Contracts --Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment.\n\nDeductions from Revenues --Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.\n\nProvisions for pharmaceutical sales returns-Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.\n\nWe record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the cost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.\n\nThe following outlines our common sales arrangements:\n\n- Customers --Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated delivery networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and nongovernment institutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpatented).\n\n## Specifically:\n\n- In the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts with the federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience ratio to the respective period's sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare 'coverage gap,' also known as the 'doughnut hole,' based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.\n- Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within each period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government's total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.\n- Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closely approximate actual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.\n\nWe recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products in 2021, for each of seven products in 2020 and for each of six products in 2019. In the aggregate, these direct products sales and/or alliance product revenues represented 75% of our revenues in 2021, 54% of our revenues in 2020 and 49% of our revenues in 2019. See Note 17B for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition. We generally provide for higher sales returns during the period in which individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n60",

      "question": "How does the decline in Sutent's revenue performance in 2021 relate to its patent expiration timeline and Pfizer's broader strategic focus on growth drivers and pipeline innovation?",
      "answer": "Sutent's revenue decline in 2021 was primarily due to lower volume demand in the U.S. following its loss of exclusivity in August 2021, as well as continued erosion from increased competition in certain international developed markets, contributing to an overall $869 million decrease in revenue. This aligns with the patent expiration timeline outlined in the 10-K, where Sutent's U.S. basic product patent expired in 2021 and its European patent is set to expire in 2022, leaving the product vulnerable to biosimilar and generic competition. In contrast, Pfizer's broader business development and R&D strategy focuses on capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities, including pipeline innovation and strategic acquisitions like Arena and partnerships such as the one with Biohaven. These initiatives aim to offset declines from mature products like Sutent by advancing new therapies and maximizing the value of existing products through improved indications and delivery methods.",

See the Item 1. Business -Research and Development section of this Form 10-K for our R&amp;D priorities and strategy. We seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:\n\n- an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients' unmet needs;\n- advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and\n- the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.\n\n## Our Business Development Initiatives\n\nWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.\n\nOur significant recent business development activities that closed or are targeted to close in 2022 include:\n\n## Acquisition of Arena\n\nIn December 2021, we and Arena announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Arena, a clinical stage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all outstanding shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transaction for a total equity value of approximately $6.7 billion. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve the proposed acquisition, which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions.\n\n## Collaboration with Biohaven\n\nIn November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., Biohaven Pharmaceutical Ireland DAC and BioShin Limited (collectively, Biohaven) pursuant to which we acquired rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Rimegepant is currently commercialized in the U.S., Israel, and the U.A.E. under the brand name Nurtec ODT, with certain additional applications pending outside of the U.S. Biohaven will continue to lead R&amp;D globally and we have the exclusive right to commercialization globally, outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the transaction, which occurred on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven $500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equity investment of $350 million. Biohaven is also eligible to receive up to $740 million in non-U.S. commercialization milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net sales outside of the U.S. In addition to the milestone payments and royalties above, we will also reimburse Biohaven for the portion of certain additional milestone payments and royalties due to third parties in accordance with preexisting Biohaven agreements, which are attributed to exU.S. sales. \u00ae\n\nFor additional information, including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see Note 2 .\n\n## Our 2021 Performance\n\n## Revenues\n\nRevenues increased $39.6 billion, or 95%, to $81.3 billion in 2021 from $41.7 billion in 2020, reflecting an operational increase of $38.4 billion, or 92%, as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.2 billion, or 3%. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues of Comirnaty and sales of Paxlovid, revenues increased 6% operationally, reflecting strong growth in Eliquis, Biosimilars, PC1, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, the Hospital therapeutic area, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially offset by declines in the Prevnar family, Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent.\n\nThe following outlines the components of the net change in revenues:\n\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenues by Geography and Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections within MD&amp;A for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance.

      "question": "How do the financial impacts of Chantix/Champix declines across Pfizer's infectious disease and legacy product segments align with the company's strategic focus on pipeline innovation and business development activities in 2022?",
      "answer": "The financial impact of Chantix/Champix declines is evident in both the infectious disease segment, where a $869M revenue reduction was reported due to the global pause in shipments related to quality concerns, and in the legacy product segment, where a $185M decline was attributed to the loss of patent protection and pandemic-related disruptions. In response to these operational challenges, Pfizer strategically pursued pipeline innovation and external partnerships, exemplified by the $6.7 billion acquisition of Arena to bolster its immuno-inflammatory disease portfolio and the $500 million collaboration with Biohaven for migraine therapies. These actions reflect Pfizer\u2019s strategic shift toward pipeline innovation and business development, as outlined in the 2022 performance review, to offset declines in legacy products and maintain long-term growth.",

See the Item 1. Business -Research and Development section of this Form 10-K for our R&amp;D priorities and strategy. We seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:\n\n- an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients' unmet needs;\n- advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and\n- the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.\n\n## Our Business Development Initiatives\n\nWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.\n\nOur significant recent business development activities that closed or are targeted to close in 2022 include:\n\n## Acquisition of Arena\n\nIn December 2021, we and Arena announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Arena, a clinical stage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all outstanding shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transaction for a total equity value of approximately $6.7 billion. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve the proposed acquisition, which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions.\n\n## Collaboration with Biohaven\n\nIn November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., Biohaven Pharmaceutical Ireland DAC and BioShin Limited (collectively, Biohaven) pursuant to which we acquired rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Rimegepant is currently commercialized in the U.S., Israel, and the U.A.E. under the brand name Nurtec ODT, with certain additional applications pending outside of the U.S. Biohaven will continue to lead R&amp;D globally and we have the exclusive right to commercialization globally, outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the transaction, which occurred on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven $500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equity investment of $350 million. Biohaven is also eligible to receive up to $740 million in non-U.S. commercialization milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net sales outside of the U.S. In addition to the milestone payments and royalties above, we will also reimburse Biohaven for the portion of certain additional milestone payments and royalties due to third parties in accordance with preexisting Biohaven agreements, which are attributed to exU.S. sales. \u00ae\n\nFor additional information, including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see Note 2 .\n\n## Our 2021 Performance\n\n## Revenues\n\nRevenues increased $39.6 billion, or 95%, to $81.3 billion in 2021 from $41.7 billion in 2020, reflecting an operational increase of $38.4 billion, or 92%, as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.2 billion, or 3%. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues of Comirnaty and sales of Paxlovid, revenues increased 6% operationally, reflecting strong growth in Eliquis, Biosimilars, PC1, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, the Hospital therapeutic area, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially offset by declines in the Prevnar family, Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent.\n\nThe following outlines the components of the net change in revenues:\n\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenues by Geography and Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections within MD&amp;A for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance.

      "question": "How did the performance of Vyndaqel/Vyndamax in 2021 reflect both the pandemic-related challenges and the underlying growth trajectory of the product, considering its impact on operational growth, revenue contribution, and the broader Rare Disease segment?",
      "answer": "Vyndaqel/Vyndamax faced pandemic-related challenges in 2021, including the postponement of elective and diagnostic procedures, which constrained its performance. Despite this, the product contributed significantly to Pfizer's Rare Disease segment, generating $2,015 million in revenue, more than doubling from $1,288 million in 2020. It also played a key role in driving operational growth, being explicitly cited as one of the contributors to Pfizer's $38.5 billion in worldwide operational growth. This indicates that while the pandemic created headwinds, the product still demonstrated strong underlying demand and growth momentum.",

          "chunk_text": "as well as COVID-19 vaccine and oral COVID-19 treatment supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. We are focused on all aspects of our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible, including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial, manufacturing, R&amp;D and corporate enabling functions globally.\n\nApart from our introduction of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and Paxlovid, our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways. Our portfolio of products experienced varying impacts from the pandemic in 2021. For example, certain of our vaccines such as the Prevnar family were impacted by disruptions to healthcare activity related to COVID-19, including the prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19. For some products such as Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, we continued to see postponement of elective and diagnostic procedures in 2021 due to COVID-19, which may subside in 2022 as COVID-19 vaccination and booster rates continue to increase and/or if COVID-19 cases subside. On the other hand, some products such as Ibrance saw accelerating demand in 2021 as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic show signs of recovery across several international markets. For detail on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our products, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income-Revenues by Geography and Revenues-Selected Product Discussion sections within this MD&amp;A.\n\nIn 2021, engagement with healthcare professionals started to return to pre-pandemic levels and we continue to review and assess epidemiological data to inform in-person engagements with healthcare professionals and to help ensure the safety of our colleagues, customers and communities. As part of our commitment to engaging our customers in the manner they prefer, we are also taking a hybrid approach of virtual and in person engagements and saw customer response to both approaches. During the pandemic, we adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information, including increasing the scale of our remote engagement. Most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to temporarily work remotely, while certain colleagues in the PGS and WRDM organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission. As of December 31, 2021, more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been fully vaccinated or received an approved exception. Also, in 2021 and to date, we have not seen a significant disruption to our supply chain, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. However, we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials potentially constraining available supply, which could have a future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. Certain of our clinical trials were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, which included, in some cases, challenges related to recruiting clinical trial participants and accruing cases in certain studies. Our clinical trials also progressed in this challenging environment through innovation, such as decentralized visits (e.g., telemedicine and home visits) to accommodate participants' ability to maintain scheduled visits, as well as working with suppliers to manage the shortage of certain clinical supplies.\n\nWe will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. Future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business, operations or financial condition and results. If we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains or significant disruptions in clinical trials or other operations, or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results.\n\nFor additional information, please see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-COVID-19 Pandemic section of this Form 10-K.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nFollowing is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. Also, see Note 1D .\n\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 . Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments: Acquisitions ( Note 1E ); Fair Value ( Note 1F ); Revenues ( Note 1H ); Asset Impairments ( Note 1M ); Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies ( Note 1Q ); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans ( Note 1R ); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies ( Note 1S ).\n\nFor a discussion of a recently adopted accounting standard and a change in accounting principle related to our pension and postretirement plans, see Notes 1B and 1C.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. For further detail on acquisition accounting, see Note 1E . Historically, intangible assets have been the most significant fair values within our business combinations. For further information on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, see Asset Impairments below.\n\n## Revenues\n\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n30",

      "answer": "Danaher's acquisition of Aldevron for $9.6 billion is reflected in the financial statements with a $3.5 billion valuation of intangible assets, which required significant forward-looking assumptions and introduced estimation uncertainty. This acquisition also contributed to a year-over-year increase in capital expenditures in 2021 and was partially financed through commercial paper issuance, adding to the company\u2019s $22.2 billion debt as of December 31, 2021. However, Aldevron was excluded from the internal control over financial reporting audit, constituting 12% of total assets but less than 1% of revenue, raising concerns about the completeness of control integration and the potential for undetected financial or operational risks in the newly acquired entity. Together, these elements suggest a complex integration scenario with material financial and control implications.",

In our opinion, Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nAs indicated in the accompanying Report of Management on Danaher Corporation's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Aldevron, which is included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 12% of total assets as of December 31, 2021 and less than 1% of the Company's total revenue for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Aldevron.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Danaher Corporation's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing manufacturing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company's businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and $791 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2021 was primarily due to incremental capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity for diagnostic testing and biopharma products (including to address increased COVID-19 related demand) as well as incremental capital expenditures as a result of the Cytiva and Aldevron Acquisitions. In 2022, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year to increase manufacturing capacity primarily to support customer demand for products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and other growth opportunities. The Company estimates capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including BARDA, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Life Sciences businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one to four years. In 2021, the Company received aggregate payments related to government grants of $73 million that offset operating expenses and capital expenditures of $41 million and $32 million, respectively.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.3 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $1.0 billion of cash provided during 2020. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to cash provided in 2021 from the issuance of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Aldevron Acquisition and the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by cash provided by the sale of common and preferred stock and borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes, as well as the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $22.2 billion and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $8 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $2.2 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company's $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has classified approximately $2.8 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, $699 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Biopharma Notes and $284 million of borrowings outstanding under the Floating Rate 2022 Euronotes as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available.\n\nUnder the Company's U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company's floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company's financial position. The U.S. dollar LIBOR-based borrowings will be available to the Company under the Five-Year Facility until 2023, upon the discontinuance of LIBOR. Prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company expects to amend the Five-Year Facility to replace LIBOR with another reference interest rate.",

          "chunk_text": "## Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the U.S. and multiple international tax jurisdictions and as a result files numerous tax returns in those locations. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise for multiple reasons, including because tax laws are subject to interpretation. For some matters, the Company uses judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were approximately $1.1 billion. As further discussed in Note 7, if the Internal Revenue Service proposes adjustments related to the Company's self-insurance programs and if the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position the Company may be required to record a charge against future earnings. The Company believes its positions related to the self-insurance programs are more likely than not sustainable and accordingly has no unrecognized tax benefit related to these self-insurance programs.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the resolution of some of these tax matters, auditing the Company's uncertain tax positions and the related unrecognized tax benefits is complex and required the use of tax subject matter resources to determine whether the more likely than not criteria was met.\n\nWe tested controls over management's accounting for uncertain tax positions, including assessment of the technical merits of tax positions.\n\nTo evaluate whether the technical merits of some uncertain tax positions are more likely than not sustainable, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of applicable tax law, court cases, tax regulations and other regulatory guidance by our tax subject matter resources. We also involved tax subject matter resources in verifying our understanding of the relevant facts and analysis by reading relevant correspondence with the tax authority and reading third-party advice obtained by management. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company's disclosures included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in relation to these matters.\n\n## Accounting for the Acquisition of Aldevron\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 30, 2021, the Company acquired Aldevron, L.L.C. ('Aldevron') for a purchase price of $9.6 billion. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. As part of the allocation of the purchase price, the Company estimated the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill to be $3.5 billion, comprised of trade names, developed technology and customer relationships.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Aldevron was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill. The estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective assets' fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of Aldevron and other related valuation assumptions. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of these assets included discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ('EBITDA'), revenue, revenue growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe tested the Company's controls over its accounting for acquisitions, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above.\n\nTo test the estimated fair value of these intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's use of the selected valuation model, testing the significant assumptions used in the model and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we compared certain assumptions to current market and economic trends, to historical results of the acquired business, to assumptions used by guideline companies within the industry, and to internal communications and analysis. Our valuation specialists assisted with the evaluation of the valuation model selected and certain assumptions, including the discount rate, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates.\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n\nTysons, Virginia February 23, 2022",

In addition, the impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2021 compared to 2020, and the impact of sales from acquisitions increased reported sales by 0.5% in 2021. During 2021, the Diagnostics segment experienced higher year-over-year sales for molecular diagnostics tests for COVID-19. Demand across the other Diagnostics segment businesses also increased with non-COVID product lines testing volumes improving as individuals resumed visits to healthcare providers following the easing of shutdowns and restrictions related to the pandemic. In 2021, core sales in the segment's clinical lab business increased on a year-over-year basis across all major geographies driven primarily by continued increased demand in the chemistry and immunoassay product lines. During 2021, core sales in the molecular diagnostics business grew on a year-over-year basis in both developed and high-growth markets, which contributed significantly to overall segment core sales growth. The business continued to experience strong growth in sales of consumables, driven primarily by increased sales of diagnostic test solutions for COVID-19, as increased production capacity allowed the business to produce more diagnostic tests in response to continued market growth, and higher year-over-year demand for testing for non-respiratory diseases. Core sales in the acute care diagnostic business increased year-over-year due to continued strong demand for blood gas consumables and immunoassay products, partially offset by lower year-over-year instrument sales largely due to strong COVID-19 related demand for blood gas instruments in 2020. Geographically, demand was strong across most major geographies. Core sales in the pathology business grew year-over-year across all major geographies, driven by increased demand for core histology, advanced staining and pathology imaging products.\n\n## Operating Profit Performance\n\nOperating profit margins increased 270 basis points during 2021 as compared to 2020. The following factors impacted year-overyear operating profit margin comparisons.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:\n\n- Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-overyear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development, sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 810 basis points\n- The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses - 20 basis points",

Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and $791 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2021 was primarily due to incremental capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity for diagnostic testing and biopharma products (including to address increased COVID-19 related demand) as well as incremental capital expenditures as a result of the Cytiva and Aldevron Acquisitions. In 2022, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year to increase manufacturing capacity primarily to support customer demand for products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and other growth opportunities. The Company estimates capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including BARDA, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Life Sciences businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one to four years. In 2021, the Company received aggregate payments related to government grants of $73 million that offset operating expenses and capital expenditures of $41 million and $32 million, respectively.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.3 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $1.0 billion of cash provided during 2020. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to cash provided in 2021 from the issuance of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Aldevron Acquisition and the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by cash provided by the sale of common and preferred stock and borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes, as well as the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $22.2 billion and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $8 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $2.2 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company's $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has classified approximately $2.8 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, $699 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Biopharma Notes and $284 million of borrowings outstanding under the Floating Rate 2022 Euronotes as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available.\n\nUnder the Company's U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company's floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company's financial position. The U.S. dollar LIBOR-based borrowings will be available to the Company under the Five-Year Facility until 2023, upon the discontinuance of LIBOR. Prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company expects to amend the Five-Year Facility to replace LIBOR with another reference interest rate.",

Aggregate 2021 and 2020 cash payments for dividends on Company common stock were $578 million and $500 million, respectively, and aggregate 2021 and 2020 cash payments for the dividends on the Company's MCPS were $164 million and $115 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase in dividend payments in 2021 primarily relates to dividends paid on the MCPS Series B, which were issued in May 2020, and an increase in the quarterly dividend rate on common stock effective with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n## Cash and Cash Requirements\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were on deposit with financial institutions or invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.2%. Of the cash and cash equivalents, $353 million was held within the United States and approximately $2.2 billion was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support general corporate purposes, which may include working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying taxes and any related interest or penalties, funding its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing shares of the Company's common stock and supporting other business needs.\n\nThe Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs (if available) or borrow under the Company's Five-Year Facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs (if available) and/or access the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time seek to access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.\n\nWhile repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company's foreign cash could be repatriated to the United States. Following enactment of the TCJA and the associated Transition Tax, in general, repatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. taxes on distributions. The cash that the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance non-U.S. operations and investments, including acquisitions. The income taxes, if any, applicable to such earnings including basis differences in our non-U.S. subsidiaries are not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2021, management believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.\n\nDuring 2021, the Company contributed $10 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $50 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2022, the Company's cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are forecasted to be approximately $10 million and $48 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan's funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.",

          "chunk_text": "credit facility with a syndicate of banks that was scheduled to expire on August 26, 2020 (the 'Superseded 364-Day Facility'). In 2020, the Company replaced the Superseded 364-Day Facility with a $2.5 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that was scheduled to expire on June 4, 2021 and then terminated such credit facility on December 31, 2020 (the 'Terminated 364-Day Credit Facility'). In 2020, the Company borrowed $2.5 billion under the Five-Year Facility and $2.5 billion under the Superseded 364-Day Facility for general corporate purposes (including payment of a portion of the purchase price for the Cytiva Acquisition and repayment of certain commercial paper obligations as they matured). All amounts borrowed under the credit facilities referenced above were repaid in 2020.\n\nThe Company expects to limit borrowings under the Five-Year Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient borrowing capacity under the facilities so that it could borrow, if needed, to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures.\n\nBorrowings under the Five-Year Facility bear interest as follows: (1) Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans (as defined in the FiveYear Facility) bear interest at a variable rate equal to the London inter-bank offered rate plus a margin of between 58.5 and 100 basis points, depending on Danaher's long-term debt credit rating; (2) Base Rate Committed Loans and Swing Line Loans (each as defined in the Five-Year Facility) bear interest at a variable rate equal to the highest of (a) the Federal funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from time to time) plus 50 basis points; (b) Bank of America's 'prime rate' as publicly announced from time to time and (c) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the Five-Year Facility) plus 100 basis points; and (3) Bid Loans (as defined in the Five-Year Facility) bear interest at the rate bid by the particular lender providing such loan. In addition, Danaher is required to pay a per annum facility fee of between 4.0 and 12.5 basis points (depending on Danaher's long-term debt credit rating) based on the aggregate commitments under the Five-Year Facility, regardless of usage.\n\nThe Five-Year Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. Borrowings under the Five-Year Facility are prepayable at the Company's option at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty. As of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the Five-Year Facility and the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the facilities. The nonperformance by any member of the Five-Year Facility syndicates would reduce the maximum capacity of the Five-Year Facility by such member's commitment amount.\n\nThe Company's obligations under the Five-Year Facility are unsecured. The Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the obligations of each of its subsidiaries in the event a subsidiary is named a borrower under the Five-Year Facility. The Five-Year Facility contains customary representations, warranties, conditions precedent, events of default, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants. The Five-Year Facility is available for liquidity support for Danaher's expanded U.S. dollar and euro commercial paper programs, as discussed below, and for general corporate purposes.\n\nUnder the Company's U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes. The notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates. The Five-Year Facility provides liquidity support for issuances under the Company's commercial paper programs, and can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The availability of the Five-Year Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Company's commercial paper programs. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, borrowings outstanding under the Company's U.S. dollar and euro commercial paper programs had a weighted average annual interest rate of negative 0.06% and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 23 days. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has classified approximately $2.8 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper programs, $284 million of borrowings outstanding under the Floating Rate 2022 Euronotes and $699 million of borrowings under the 2022 Biopharma Notes as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet (even though such borrowings are scheduled to mature within one year of December 31, 2021) as the Company had the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.\n\nThe Company's ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of the Company's credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Company's credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program and the Five-Year Facility, and could limit or preclude the Company's ability to issue commercial paper. If the Company's access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a credit downgrade, change in market conditions or otherwise, the Company expects it would rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow, the Five-Year Facility and any other available sources of financing to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the Five-Year Facility or other available sources of financing could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.",

      "answer": "Danaher's strategic positioning in developed markets is reinforced by strong performance in both the Diagnostics and Life Sciences segments. In 2021, the Diagnostics segment saw core sales growth in both developed and high-growth markets, driven by increased demand for molecular diagnostics and consumables, including those related to COVID-19. This growth contributed significantly to the segment\u2019s overall performance and improved operating margins. Meanwhile, the Life Sciences segment reported 63% of its 2021 sales from developed markets (36% North America, 27% Western Europe), underscoring a substantial revenue base from mature economies. Combined with the Diagnostics segment\u2019s geographic spread (40% North America, 24% Western Europe), this indicates a dominant presence in developed markets, which likely supports stable cash flow and provides a foundation for reinvestment in growth areas. This dual strength in developed markets aligns with Danaher\u2019s broader strategy of leveraging DBS tools for sustainable value creation.",

In addition, the impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2021 compared to 2020, and the impact of sales from acquisitions increased reported sales by 0.5% in 2021. During 2021, the Diagnostics segment experienced higher year-over-year sales for molecular diagnostics tests for COVID-19. Demand across the other Diagnostics segment businesses also increased with non-COVID product lines testing volumes improving as individuals resumed visits to healthcare providers following the easing of shutdowns and restrictions related to the pandemic. In 2021, core sales in the segment's clinical lab business increased on a year-over-year basis across all major geographies driven primarily by continued increased demand in the chemistry and immunoassay product lines. During 2021, core sales in the molecular diagnostics business grew on a year-over-year basis in both developed and high-growth markets, which contributed significantly to overall segment core sales growth. The business continued to experience strong growth in sales of consumables, driven primarily by increased sales of diagnostic test solutions for COVID-19, as increased production capacity allowed the business to produce more diagnostic tests in response to continued market growth, and higher year-over-year demand for testing for non-respiratory diseases. Core sales in the acute care diagnostic business increased year-over-year due to continued strong demand for blood gas consumables and immunoassay products, partially offset by lower year-over-year instrument sales largely due to strong COVID-19 related demand for blood gas instruments in 2020. Geographically, demand was strong across most major geographies. Core sales in the pathology business grew year-over-year across all major geographies, driven by increased demand for core histology, advanced staining and pathology imaging products.\n\n## Operating Profit Performance\n\nOperating profit margins increased 270 basis points during 2021 as compared to 2020.

Rales, envisioned a business that would generate sustainable long-term value for customers, employees and shareholders. Through a series of acquisitions and divestitures, Danaher has evolved over time into the science and technology innovator it is today. While the operating companies that make up Danaher have changed, DBS continues to be the guiding philosophy for the Company.\n\nSales in 2021 by geographic destination (geographic destination refers to the geographic area where the final sale to the Company's unaffiliated customer is made) as a percentage of total 2021 sales were: North America, 40% (including 38% in the United States); Western Europe, 24%; other developed markets, 5%; and high-growth markets, 31%.

The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment's capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible.\n\nOn February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $407 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well.

Customer activity in the industrial and applied market returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021. Revenues from customers in the diagnostics and healthcare market were driven by growth in COVID-19 testing-related products as the company continued to support the societal response to the pandemic. Sales growth was strong across all geographic regions during 2021. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:\n\n- Developing high-impact, innovative new products,\n- Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and\n- Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.\n\nGAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin increased in 2021 due primarily to profit on higher sales and sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments to support the company's near and long-term growth.\n\nThe company's references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company's references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases.\n\n## Notable Recent Acquisitions\n\nOn January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgiumbased European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $830 million in net cash consideration.

      "answer": "Thermo Fisher acquired Mesa Biotech in February 2021 for $407 million in cash and $65 million in contingent consideration to accelerate its capabilities in advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. However, Mesa Biotech was excluded from the internal control over financial reporting assessment for the year ended December 31, 2021, along with PPD and PeproTech, representing approximately 5% of total assets and 2% of total revenues.

      "answer": "Basaglar's declining U.S. revenue from $842.3M (2020) to $588.3M (2021) and international revenue drop from $282.1M to $304.2M (2020-2021) (page_65), combined with its negative milestone capitalization of $(149.3M) in 2021 (page_71), indicates reduced strategic emphasis. This contrasts with Eli Lilly's internally developed diabetes products like Trulicity, which saw strong revenue growth ($4,914.4M in U.S. 2021) and is highlighted in the business section as a key innovation (page_5). The collaborative nature of Basaglar with Boehringer Ingelheim (page_5) and its declining financial metrics (page_65), alongside negative milestone capitalization (page_71), suggest a strategic de-emphasis in favor of proprietary products such as Trulicity that align with Lilly's stated priority of 'continually discovering or acquiring, developing, and commercializing innovative new medicines.'",

These investments can take many forms, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, or Spain. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition establishes a new modality for drug discovery and development, extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets.\n\nIn February 2020, we acquired all shares of Dermira, Inc. for a purchase price of $849.3 million, net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired lebrikizumab, a novel, investigational, monoclonal antibody being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab was granted Fast Track designation from the FDA. We also acquired Qbrexza cloth, a medicated cloth for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating). In 2021, we sold the rights to Qbrexza. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of the rights to Qbrexza.\n\nIn February 2019, we acquired all shares of Loxo for a purchase price of $6.92 billion, net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines, including selpercatinib, an oral RET inhibitor, and LOXO-305 (pirtobrutinib), an oral BTK inhibitor. In the second quarter of 2020, the FDA approved selpercatinib (Retevmo) under its Accelerated Approval regulations and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\n\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our recent acquisitions.\n\n42",

      "question": "How does Lilly's discussion of import certification risks in the context of cGMP compliance, third-party manufacturing dependencies, and evolving regulatory standards collectively impact their ability to maintain uninterrupted supply of tirzepatide and protect revenue growth?",
      "answer": "Lilly faces import certification risks that are directly tied to compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), as noted on page 15, where failure to meet regulatory standards can lead to import bans or denials of import certifications. This is especially relevant given that certain products, including tirzepatide, rely on third-party manufacturers whose compliance failures could disrupt supply or delay approvals, as mentioned on page 46. Additionally, page 36 highlights that evolving regulatory standards and increased scrutiny\u2014especially around excipients and impurities\u2014can result in production interruptions and import certification issues, further complicating the company\u2019s ability to maintain a stable supply chain. Together, these factors create a complex regulatory landscape where Lilly must balance third-party dependencies, evolving compliance expectations, and the need to avoid disruptions in tirzepatide availability, all of which directly affect revenue stability and growth potential.",

          "chunk_text": "Consolidation and integration of priv ate payers and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payer lev erage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore, restrictiv e or unfav orable pricing, cov erage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by gov ernments, regulatory agencies, courts, or priv ate payers may adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, which could adv ersely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in litigation and inv estigations related to the 340B program, access to insulin, pricing, product safety, and other matters that, if resolv ed adv ersely to us, could negativ ely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the ov erall potential adv erse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.\n\nIn addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, safety signals, ev olv ing standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, inability to realize the benefit of capital expenditures, or delays or denials in new product approv als, line extensions or supplemental approv als of current products pending resolution of the issues, or other negativ e impacts, any of which result in reputational harm or adv ersely affect our business. See Item 1, \"Business-Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access,\" Item 1A, \"Risk\n\nFactors,\" and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Incretin Medicines\n\nAt v arious times during 2024, demand for our incretin medicines exceeded production. Supply and channel dynamics hav e also contributed to v ariability in quarter-ov er-quarter rev enue growth rates for tirzepatide. Tirzepatide supply currently exceeds demand in the U.S. Demand in launched markets remains dynamic, and increases or changes in demand, by dose or ov erall, as well as the complex supply chain, may result in periodic unav ailability of certain presentations and dose lev els at certain locations ev en when total tirzepatide supply can meet demand. Supply considerations will continue to influence the timing and approach (including av ailable presentations) of tirzepatide launches in new markets. We continue to expand manufacturing capacity and progress efforts to bring tirzepatide to patients v ia different deliv ery presentations, such as single-use v ials and multi-use pens. Production increases will continue, and additional capacity is expected to be operational ov er the next sev eral years.\n\nWe have seen an increase in the production, marketing, and sale of counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded incretins. These practices may impact patient safety and undermine regulatory drug approv al processes. Lilly will continue to consider all options, including filing lawsuits where appropriate, to address unlawful practices and the patient safety risks of unapprov ed, untested, and manipulated drugs.\n\nSee Item 1, \"Business-Government Regulation of Our Operations and Products' and Item 1A, \"Risk -Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe and our products face intense competition, including from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business,\" for additional information.",

      "answer": "Lilly has experienced production interruptions for tirzepatide, where demand exceeded supply at various times in 2024, leading to variability in quarterly revenue growth (page 46). These interruptions are compounded by regulatory scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, which can result in production halts, product recalls, and delays in approvals (page 36). Additionally, Lilly relies on third-party manufacturers for certain products, and any failure by these partners to comply with cGMP regulations could further disrupt supply and delay new product approvals (page 15). Together, these factors create a complex risk environment where production limitations, regulatory compliance challenges, and supply chain dependencies could hinder Lilly\u2019s ability to consistently meet market demand and sustain revenue growth for key products like tirzepatide.",

Furthermore, restrictiv e or unfav orable pricing, cov erage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by gov ernments, regulatory agencies, courts, or priv ate payers may adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, which could adv ersely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in litigation and inv estigations related to the 340B program, access to insulin, pricing, product safety, and other matters that, if resolv ed adv ersely to us, could negativ ely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the ov erall potential adv erse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.\n\nIn addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, safety signals, ev olv ing standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, inability to realize the benefit of capital expenditures, or delays or denials in new product approv als, line extensions or supplemental approv als of current products pending resolution of the issues, or other negativ e impacts, any of which result in reputational harm or adv ersely affect our business.

Supply and channel dynamics hav e also contributed to v ariability in quarter-ov er-quarter rev enue growth rates for tirzepatide. Tirzepatide supply currently exceeds demand in the U.S. Demand in launched markets remains dynamic, and increases or changes in demand, by dose or ov erall, as well as the complex supply chain, may result in periodic unav ailability of certain presentations and dose lev els at certain locations ev en when total tirzepatide supply can meet demand. Supply considerations will continue to influence the timing and approach (including av ailable presentations) of tirzepatide launches in new markets.

          "chunk_text": "The defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan allocation for the U.S. and Puerto Rico currently comprises approximately 80 percent growth inv estments and 20 percent fixed-income inv estments. The growth inv estment allocation encompasses U.S. and international public equity securities, hedge funds, priv ate equity-like inv estments, and real estate. These portfolio allocations are intended to reduce ov erall risk by prov iding div ersification, while seeking moderate to high returns ov er the long term.\n\nPublic equity securities are well div ersified and inv ested in U.S. and international small-to-large companies across v arious asset managers and styles. The remaining portion of the growth portfolio is inv ested in priv ate alternativ e inv estments.\n\nFixed-income inv estments primarily consist of fixed-income securities in U.S. treasuries and agencies, emerging market debt obligations, corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed obligations, and any related repurchase agreements.\n\nHedge funds are priv ately owned institutional inv estment funds that generally hav e moderate liquidity. Hedge funds seek specified lev els of absolute return regardless of ov erall market conditions, and generally hav e low correlations to public equity and debt markets. Hedge funds often inv est substantially in financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, deriv ativ es, etc.) using a v ery broad range of trading activ ities to manage portfolio risks. Hedge fund strategies focus primarily on security selection and seek to be neutral with respect to market mov es. Common groupings of hedge fund strategies include relativ e v alue, tactical, and ev ent driv en. Relativ e v alue strategies include arbitrage, when the same asset can simultaneously be bought and sold at different prices, achiev ing an immediate profit. Tactical strategies often take long and short positions to reduce or eliminate ov erall market risks while seeking a particular inv estment opportunity. Ev ent strategy opportunities can ev olv e from specific company announcements such as mergers and acquisitions, and typically hav e little correlation to ov erall market directional mov ements. Our hedge fund inv estments are made through limited partnership interests in fund-of-funds structures and directly into hedge funds. Plan holdings in hedge funds are valued based on net asset v alues (NAVs) calculated by each fund or general partner, as applicable, and we hav e the ability to redeem these inv estments at NAV.\n\nPriv ate equity-like inv estment funds typically hav e low liquidity and are made through long-term partnerships or joint v entures that inv est in pools of capital inv ested in primarily non-publicly traded entities. Underlying inv estments include v enture capital (early stage inv esting), buyout, special situations, priv ate debt, and priv ate real estate inv estments. Priv ate equity management firms typically acquire and then reorganize priv ate companies to create increased long term v alue. Priv ate equity-like funds usually hav e a limited life of approximately 10-15 years, and require a minimum inv estment commitment from their limited partners. Our priv ate equity-like inv estments are made both directly into funds and through fund-of-funds structures to ensure broad div ersification of management styles and assets across the portfolio. Plan holdings in priv ate equity-like inv estments are v alued using the value reported by the partnership, adjusted for known cash flows and significant ev ents through our reporting date. Values prov ided by the partnerships are primarily based on analysis of and judgments about the underlying inv estments. Inputs to these v aluations include underlying NAVs, discounted cash flow v aluations, comparable market v aluations, and may also include adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks as applicable. The vast majority of these priv ate partnerships prov ide us with annual audited financial statements including their compliance with fair v aluation procedures consistent with applicable accounting standards.\n\nReal estate is composed of public holdings. Real estate inv estments in registered inv estment companies that trade on an exchange are classified as Level 1 on the fair v alue hierarchy. Real estate inv estments in funds measured at fair v alue on the basis of NAV prov ided by the fund manager are classified as such. These NAVs are dev eloped with inputs including discounted cash flow, independent appraisal, and market comparable analyses.\n\nOther assets include cash and cash equiv alents and mark-to-market v alue of deriv ativ es.\n\nThe cash value of the trust-owned insurance contract is primarily inv ested in inv estment-grade publicly traded equity and fixed-income securities.\n\nOther than hedge funds, priv ate equity-like inv estments, and a portion of the real estate holdings, which are discussed abov e, we determine fair v alues based on a market approach using quoted market v alues, significant other observ able inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities, or discounted cash flow analyses.",

      "question": "How has the allocation and valuation methodology of U.S. Public Equity Securities in LLY's Defined Benefit Pension Plans evolved between the most recent two reporting periods, and how does this align with the company's stated investment strategy for these assets?",
      "answer": "In the most recent reporting period (page_100), LLY's Defined Benefit Pension Plans held $1,379.7 million in U.S. Public Equity Securities, with $490.5 million valued using Level 1 inputs and $888.9 million using Net Asset Value (NAV). In the prior period (page_99), this value was higher at $1,905.6 million, with $602.4 million under Level 1 and $1,302.9 million under NAV. This indicates a significant decrease in both total value and NAV-based allocation year-over-year. According to the investment strategy outlined on page_98, U.S. public equities are part of a diversified growth portfolio intended to reduce overall risk through diversification while seeking moderate to high returns. The drop in NAV-based valuation suggests a potential shift in investment mix or market value decline, despite the strategic emphasis on diversification and long-term growth.",

          "chunk_text": "The defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan allocation for the U.S. and Puerto Rico currently comprises approximately 80 percent growth inv estments and 20 percent fixed-income inv estments. The growth inv estment allocation encompasses U.S. and international public equity securities, hedge funds, priv ate equity-like inv estments, and real estate. These portfolio allocations are intended to reduce ov erall risk by prov iding div ersification, while seeking moderate to high returns ov er the long term.\n\nPublic equity securities are well div ersified and inv ested in U.S. and international small-to-large companies across v arious asset managers and styles. The remaining portion of the growth portfolio is inv ested in priv ate alternativ e inv estments.\n\nFixed-income inv estments primarily consist of fixed-income securities in U.S. treasuries and agencies, emerging market debt obligations, corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed obligations, and any related repurchase agreements.\n\nHedge funds are priv ately owned institutional inv estment funds that generally hav e moderate liquidity. Hedge funds seek specified lev els of absolute return regardless of ov erall market conditions, and generally hav e low correlations to public equity and debt markets. Hedge funds often inv est substantially in financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, deriv ativ es, etc.) using a v ery broad range of trading activ ities to manage portfolio risks. Hedge fund strategies focus primarily on security selection and seek to be neutral with respect to market mov es. Common groupings of hedge fund strategies include relativ e v alue, tactical, and ev ent driv en. Relativ e v alue strategies include arbitrage, when the same asset can simultaneously be bought and sold at different prices, achiev ing an immediate profit. Tactical strategies often take long and short positions to reduce or eliminate ov erall market risks while seeking a particular inv estment opportunity. Ev ent strategy opportunities can ev olv e from specific company announcements such as mergers and acquisitions, and typically hav e little correlation to ov erall market directional mov ements. Our hedge fund inv estments are made through limited partnership interests in fund-of-funds structures and directly into hedge funds. Plan holdings in hedge funds are valued based on net asset v alues (NAVs) calculated by each fund or general partner, as applicable, and we hav e the ability to redeem these inv estments at NAV.\n\nPriv ate equity-like inv estment funds typically hav e low liquidity and are made through long-term partnerships or joint v entures that inv est in pools of capital inv ested in primarily non-publicly traded entities. Underlying inv estments include v enture capital (early stage inv esting), buyout, special situations, priv ate debt, and priv ate real estate inv estments. Priv ate equity management firms typically acquire and then reorganize priv ate companies to create increased long term v alue. Priv ate equity-like funds usually hav e a limited life of approximately 10-15 years, and require a minimum inv estment commitment from their limited partners. Our priv ate equity-like inv estments are made both directly into funds and through fund-of-funds structures to ensure broad div ersification of management styles and assets across the portfolio. Plan holdings in priv ate equity-like inv estments are v alued using the value reported by the partnership, adjusted for known cash flows and significant ev ents through our reporting date. Values prov ided by the partnerships are primarily based on analysis of and judgments about the underlying inv estments. Inputs to these v aluations include underlying NAVs, discounted cash flow v aluations, comparable market v aluations, and may also include adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks as applicable. The vast majority of these priv ate partnerships prov ide us with annual audited financial statements including their compliance with fair v aluation procedures consistent with applicable accounting standards.\n\nReal estate is composed of public holdings. Real estate inv estments in registered inv estment companies that trade on an exchange are classified as Level 1 on the fair v alue hierarchy. Real estate inv estments in funds measured at fair v alue on the basis of NAV prov ided by the fund manager are classified as such.

      "question": "Given STELARA's decline in sales and its material importance to JNJ's Innovative Medicine segment, how does the product's competitive positioning and expected biosimilar launches align with its therapeutic role in immunology and the broader strategic direction of the company?",
      "answer": "STELARA accounted for approximately 11.7% of JNJ's total revenues in fiscal 2024, but its sales declined by 4.6% ($10,361M in 2024 vs. $10,858M in 2023). This decline is expected to accelerate with the anticipated biosimilar launches in Europe and the U.S. in 2025, which will increase competition and reduce market exclusivity. STELARA is a key treatment in JNJ's Immunology therapeutic area, specifically for conditions like plaque psoriasis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and ulcerative colitis. Despite its therapeutic importance, the product's future is constrained by patent settlements and the competitive environment, indicating a strategic need for JNJ to diversify or innovate within its immunology portfolio to maintain leadership in this therapeutic area.",

          "chunk_text": "and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings-Intellectual property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nSales of the Company's largest product, collectively DA RZA LEX  (daratumumab) and DA RZA LEX  FA SPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 13.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2024. A ccordingly, the patents related to these products are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound/use patent protection in select countries extends to 2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DA RZA LEX  FA SPRO.\n\nSales of the Company's second largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately 11.7% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2024. According to patent settlement and license agreements, the Company expects continued launches of biosimilar versions of STELARA in Europe and the United States in 2025 which will impact the Company's sales of STELARA.\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.\n\n## Competition\n\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research.\n\n## Environment\n\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company's compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe Company's businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations, and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical product and medical technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug A dministration (the U.S. FDA ) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA  approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S.",

      "answer": "Shockwave contributed $564 million in revenue in fiscal 2024, marking its operational significance within the Cardiovascular segment. It was also integrated into JNJ's workforce structure, with its employees counted in the company's global headcount for the first time, reflecting strategic alignment and operational assimilation. Additionally, the acquisition resulted in a $0.4 billion fair value inventory step-up impact on cost of goods sold, indicating tangible short-term financial effects from the business combination accounting. Together, these elements show Shockwave's role as both a financial contributor and a strategically embedded entity within JNJ's broader MedTech and Cardiovascular growth initiatives.",

      "question": "With biosimilar competition leading to rapid price declines for reference products, does MVASI's $826 million in U.S. sales in 2021 reflect Amgen's ability to offset market pressures through its own biosimilar strategy?",
      "answer": "MVASI, Amgen's biosimilar to Avastin, achieved $826 million in U.S. sales in 2021, showing meaningful uptake in a competitive oncology market (page 69). This aligns with Amgen's broader biosimilar strategy, which includes launching MVASI alongside other biosimilars like KANJINTI and AMJEVITA to compete against branded and biosimilar versions of competitor products (page 62). However, despite this growth, the 10-K notes that as more biosimilar competitors enter the market, net selling prices tend to decline significantly, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of MVASI\u2019s current sales trajectory in the face of intensifying competition (page 15). Therefore, while MVASI\u2019s performance indicates some success in capturing market share, the broader context suggests ongoing pricing pressure could challenge its long-term profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Competition\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. A number of our marketed products are indicated for disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through R&amp;D activities. Additionally, some competitor-marketed  products  target  the  same  genetic  pathways  as  our  recently  launched  marketed  products  or  are  currently  in development. This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products. We continue to pursue ways of increasing the value  of  our  medicines  through  innovations  during  their  life  cycles,  which  can  include  expanding  the  disease  areas  for  which  our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, we market the Neulasta Onpro kit, which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving the patient a trip back to the doctor. We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our  competitive  position.  Such  position  may  be  based  on,  among  other  things,  safety,  efficacy,  reliability,  availability,  patient convenience, delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration.\n\nCertain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars and generics. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been  obtained  based  on  a  demonstration  that  it  is  'highly  similar'  to  the  original  reference  product.  We  have  experienced  adverse effects  from  biosimilar  competition  on  our  originator  product  sales.  Companies  have  launched  biosimilar  versions  of  EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta and have approved biosimilars for ENBREL. Once multiple biosimilar versions of one of our originator products have launched, competition has intensified rapidly, resulting in greater net price declines for both reference and biosimilar products,  and  a  greater  effect  on  product  sales.  See  also  Government  Regulation-Regulation  in  the  United  States-Approval  of Biosimilars. Although competitor biosimilars compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, supply reliability and safety of our products. As additional biosimilar competitors come to market, we will continue to leverage our global experience to distinguish against both branded and biosimilar competition.\n\nWe also  have  our  own  biosimilar  products  both  in  the  United  States  and  outside  of  U.S.  markets  that  are  competing  against branded  and  biosimilar  versions  of  our  competitors'  products.  In  2019,  Amgen  launched  MVASI,  a  biosimilar  to  Avastin,  and KANJINTI, a biosimilar to Herceptin; and in 2018, Amgen launched AMGEVITA, a biosimilar to Humira in ex-U.S. markets. We have also received FDA approval of AMJEVITA, a biosimilar to Humira for the U.S. market, and plan to launch in the United States in January 2023. In 2020, we launched AVSOLA, a biosimilar to Remicade; and in January 2021, we launched RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. We expect additional biosimilar competition against both our branded and biosimilar products in the future across markets.\n\nAlthough  most  of  our  products  are  biologics,  some  are  small  molecule  products.  Because  the  FDA  approval  process  permits generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and time-consuming clinical trials, generic manufacturers can often develop and market their competing versions of our small molecule products at much lower prices. For example, following loss of exclusivity of patents directed to cinacalcet, the active ingredient in our small molecule calcimimetic Sensipar, we lost a significant share of the market and corresponding revenues in a very short period of time. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information  about  existing  products  may  result  in  (i)  increased  competition  for  our  marketed  products,  even  for  those  protected  by patents and/or (ii) reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates. (As used in this document, the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies.) See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future .",

          "chunk_text": "## Overview\n\nAmgen is a biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.\n\nOur  principal  products  are  ENBREL,  Prolia,  Otezla,  XGEVA,  Neulasta, Aranesp,  Repatha,  KYPROLIS  and  Nplate.  We  also market  a  number  of  other  products,  including  MVASI,  Vectibix,  KANJINTI,  EVENITY,  EPOGEN,  BLINCYTO,  AMGEVITA, Aimovig, Parsabiv, NEUPOGEN, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, Sensipar/Mimpara and TEZSPIRE. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.\n\nOur strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, CV disease, nephrology and neuroscience. And we conduct discovery  research  primarily  in  three  therapeutic  areas:  inflammation,  oncology/hematology  and  general  medicine.  In  2021,  we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched new products, completed several strategic transactions to augment our pipeline and research capabilities,  and  continued  providing  uninterrupted  supplies  of  our  medicines  globally  through  the  second  year  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and while advancing our ESG efforts.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to advance our pipeline, including achieving key regulatory approvals for LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE. Our  external  business  development  activities  for  2021  included:  (i)  acquiring  Five  Prime,  including  a  later-stage  gastric  cancer bemarituzumab program; (ii) entering into a license agreement with KKC to develop a later-stage molecule for atopic dermatitis and other diseases; and (iii) acquiring Teneobio for its proprietary technologies and oncology programs in development. We also continued to  advance  our  biosimilar  program  with  the  launch  of  RIABNI  in  the  United  States  and  introduced  our  other  biosimilars  into  new markets. Our biosimilars are expected to continue launching in new markets throughout 2022.\n\nDuring 2021, while meeting the challenges of a global pandemic and facing increased competition from biosimilars and generics, total  product  sales  were  relatively  flat  as  volume  growth  was  offset  by  lower  net  selling  prices.  Product  sales  decreased  4%  in  the United  States,  driven  by  lower  net  selling  prices,  partially  offset  by  volume  growth,  and  increased  12%  ROW,  driven  by  volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling prices. Total operating expenses increased 13%, driven by IPR&amp;D expense from the Five Prime acquisition and the upfront payment associated with the KKC licensing agreement.\n\nCash flows from operating activities totaled $9.3 billion, which supported investment in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2021, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.76 per share of common stock. In December 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $1.94 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2022. We also repurchased 21.7 million shares of our common stock during 2021 at an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. In 2021, we issued $4.9 billion and repaid $4.2 billion of debt that was coming due in 2022.\n\nAmgen's approach to, and investment in, human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining  talent  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  running  an  enterprise  focused  on  the  discovery,  development  and  commercialization  of innovative  medicines.  Our  compensation,  benefits  and  development  programs  are  designed  to  encourage  performance,  promote accountability and adherence to Company values, and align with the interests of the Company's shareholders. Further, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. We are engaging in activities and setting goals to improve our focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging. For further information on these and other efforts, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Human Capital Resources.\n\nWe have a long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible, and we regularly set targets to challenge ourselves to deliver further improvements. In 2020, we met or exceeded our environmental sustainability targets set out in 2013 that called for reducing fleet carbon output by up to 20%, facility carbon output by 10%, water consumption by 10% and waste disposal by 35%.  We achieved our 2020 targets while growing revenues, increasing production capacity and expanding to approximately 100 countries over the same 2013-20 period. To continue on our path to greater environmental sustainability, in January 2021 we announced a new set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027, including achieving carbon neutrality, reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste disposed by 75%. 2 2, 3\n\nRepresents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verified reduction projects, and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the Company. 2\n\nCarbon neutrality goal refers to Scope 1 and 2. 3",

      "answer": "Amgen acquired Teneobio in October 2021, a clinical-stage biotechnology company known for its human heavy-chain antibody platform, and the transaction included an initial allocation of assets and liabilities shown in a summary table (in millions) from the acquisition date. In addition to this, Amgen has a contingent obligation of up to $1.6 billion tied to the achievement of development, regulatory, and commercial milestones related to Teneobio. This acquisition complements Amgen's existing antibody capabilities and BiTE platform, aiming to accelerate the discovery and development of new molecules in its core therapeutic areas. The financial exposure is significant, with the contingent consideration alone valued at approximately $0.3 billion on Amgen's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "In November 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting standard around the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. The new standard clarifies that contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination from an acquiree should initially be recognized by applying revenue recognition principles and not at fair value. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted. The impact of this standard will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions.\n\n## 2. Acquisitions\n\nTeneobio, Inc.\n\nOn  October  19,  2021,  we  acquired  all  of  the  outstanding  stock  of  Teneobio,  a  privately  held,  clinical-stage  biotechnology company developing a new class of biologics called human heavy-chain antibodies, which are single-chain antibodies composed of the human  heavy-chain  domain.  The  transaction,  which  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination,  includes  Teneobio's  proprietary bispecific and multispecific antibody technologies, which complement Amgen's existing antibody capabilities and BiTE platform and will enable significant acceleration and efficiency in the discovery and development of new molecules to treat diseases across Amgen's core  therapeutic  areas.  Upon  its  acquisition,  Teneobio  became  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of Amgen,  and  its  operations  have  been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date. \u00ae\n\nThe following table summarizes the total consideration and allocated acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "We have purchase obligations of $3.2 billion primarily related to (i) R&amp;D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Most of these obligations are expected to be paid within one year, and payment of certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.\n\nIn addition to the purchase obligations noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into  with  third  parties,  including  contingent  consideration  incurred  in  the  acquisitions  of  Teneobio  and  K-A.  These  payments  are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring, and any resulting cash requirements are managed through our operational budgeting processes. Except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration of approximately $0.3 billion, these obligations are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.4 billion, including $1.6 billion of contingent consideration payments in connection with our Teneobio acquisition.\n\nWe have recorded liabilities for UTBs that, because of their nature, have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payment and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  notes  to  the  financial  statements.  Some  of  those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results  could  differ  materially  from  those  estimates  under  different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are included in Part IV-Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies.  The  following  are  considered  critical  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  because  they  require  the  most  difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Product sales and sales deductions\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does Amgen's strategic investment in BeiGene, including profit-sharing and R&D cost-sharing arrangements, reconcile with the financial impact observed in Amgen's R&D expenses and the accounting treatment of the equity method investment?",
      "answer": "Amgen's strategic investment in BeiGene, which includes profit-sharing and R&D cost-sharing arrangements, is reflected in three key ways across the filing: (1) Amgen's initial $2.8 billion investment in BeiGene is accounted for under the equity method, with a $2.4 billion basis difference allocated to intangible assets and amortized over 8\u201315 years; (2) Amgen shared in BeiGene\u2019s net losses\u2014$265 million in 2021 and $229 million in 2020\u2014and amortization of the basis difference\u2014$172 million in 2021 and $109 million in 2020\u2014both reducing the carrying value of the investment; and (3) these losses and amortization were partially offset by BeiGene\u2019s contributions to Amgen\u2019s R&D expenses, which reduced Amgen\u2019s R&D costs in 2020.

In addition, we acquire product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&amp;D  capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product  base.  These arrangements  generally provide for nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees,  development  and  commercial-performance  milestone  payments,  cost  sharing,  royalty  payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\n\nTrade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we  generally  require  counterparties  to  execute  confidentiality  agreements  upon  commencement  of  a  business  relationship  with  us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in early 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash  and  development  services  of  up  to  $1.25  billion.  Upon  regulatory  approval,  BeiGene  will  assume  commercialization  rights  in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.\n\n## Novartis\n\nWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig. On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Part IVNote 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arrangement through December 31, 2021\n\nIn the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal,  recognized  product  sales  of  Aimovig  in  the  United  States,  shared  U.S.  commercialization  costs  with  Novartis  and  paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis held global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&amp;D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to  make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States.\n\n## Arrangement after January 1, 2022\n\nPursuant  to  the  amendment  effective  January  1,  2022,  Novartis  retains  the  ex-U.S.  Novartis  Rights  and  will  continue  to  pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig. Amgen and Novartis will continue to share development expenses worldwide.\n\nAmgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig worldwide.",

For the year ended December 31, 2019, realized gains on interest-bearing securities were $92 million and realized losses were not material. Realized gains and losses on interest-bearing securities are recorded in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method.\n\nThe primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nWe held investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values of $611 million and $477 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  net  unrealized  gains  on  publicly  traded  securities  were  $161  million,  $174  million  and $112 million, respectively.

For the year  ended  December  31,  2021,  gains  due  to  upward  adjustments  on  these  securities  were  $152  million,  and  gains  realized  on  the dispositions of these securities were $41 million; for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, gains due to upward adjustments and gains realized upon dispositions of these securities were not material. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, downward  adjustments  to  the  carrying  values  of  these  securities  were  not  material.  Adjustments  were  based  on  observable  price transactions.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% ownership interest in BeiGene for $2.8 billion, of which $2.6 billion was attributed to the fair value of equity securities upon closing, with the remainder attributed to prepaid R&amp;D. Our equity investment in BeiGene is included  in  Other  noncurrent  assets  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Our  equity  investment  is  accounted  for  under  the  equity method of accounting due to our ability to exert significant influence over BeiGene. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, for factors in concluding our ability to exert significant influence over BeiGene. The fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets of BeiGene by approximately $2.4 billion. The equity method of accounting requires us to identify and allocate amounts to items that give rise to the basis difference and to amortize these items over their useful lives. This amortization, along with our share of the results of operations of BeiGene, is included in Other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Recognition occurs one quarter in arrears, which began in the second quarter of 2020. The basis difference was allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, equity-method goodwill and related deferred taxes. The finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a period ranging from 8 to 15 years.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of the investment was reduced by our share of BeiGene's net losses of $265 million and $229 million, respectively, and amortization of the basis difference of $172 million and $109 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we increased the carrying value by $50 million and $569 million, respectively, as a result of our purchase of additional shares of BeiGene. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,  the  carrying  value  increased  by  $265  million  and  $34  million,  respectively,  from  the  impact  of  other  BeiGene  ownership transactions.",

      "question": "How does Amgen's discussion of regulatory and operational risks associated with drug delivery devices in its R&D and commercial operations align with its historical challenges and dependencies on third-party manufacturers for these devices?",
      "answer": "Amgen faces significant regulatory and operational risks tied to drug delivery devices, which are integral to the commercialization and use of several products like Neulasta Onpro and ENBREL Mini. In its risk factors (page 34), Amgen highlights that these devices have their own regulatory, manufacturing, and safety risks, and that disruptions or failures in their supply or approval could delay or prevent product approvals or sales. This is compounded by Amgen's reliance on third-party suppliers for these devices (page 51), which introduces dependency risks related to supply continuity, regulatory compliance, and device modifications. Historically, Amgen has faced real-world issues such as FDA scrutiny of the Neulasta Onpro kit in 2017, which required labeling and device enhancements to address complaints (page 51). Additionally, regulatory authorities may require concurrent approval of a drug and its associated device, which increases the complexity and timeline for market entry (page 51). These risks are further emphasized in the context of pharmacovigilance and safety reporting, where device malfunctions or adverse events can trigger regulatory actions, including labeling changes or product withdrawal (page 50). Together, these perspectives show a consistent theme: Amgen's ability to develop, commercialize, and maintain its drug products is closely tied to the regulatory success, manufacturing reliability, and safety performance of third-party drug delivery devices.",

Alternatively, we may be required to change the product's labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  can  also  impose  post-marketing  pediatric  study  requirements.  Failure  to  fulfill  such  requirements  may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product's marketing authorization.\n\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events  reported  to  us  and  to  communicate  to  regulatory  agencies  these  adverse  events  and  safety  signals  regarding  our  products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in  combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory  agencies  determine  that  we  or  other  parties  (including  our  clinical  trial  investigators,  those  operating  our  patient  support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality  assessment  requirements,  we  may  become  subject  to  additional  inspections,  warning  letters  or  other  enforcement  actions, including fines,  marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product's approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:\n\n- revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;\n- requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;\n- post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;\n- product recalls of our approved products;\n- required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;\n- revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;\n- increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or\n- treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.\n\nFor example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated CV serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials  for  EVENITY  but  not  in  another,  larger  phase  3  study,  in  April  2019  the  FDA  approved  EVENITY  for  the  treatment  of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.\n\nIn addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently  manufactured,  marketed  and  sold  by  other  pharmaceutical  companies.  In  some  markets,  there  is  not  yet  a  legislative  or regulatory  pathway  for  the  approval  of  biosimilars.  In  the  United  States,  the  BPCIA  provided  for  such  a  pathway;  while  the  FDA continues to develop regulatory and scientific policies for biosimilars, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways, or changes in existing regulatory pathways, including degradation of regulatory standards, could result in delays or difficulties  in  getting  our  biosimilar  products  approved  by  regulatory  authorities,  subject  us  to  unanticipated  development  costs  or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have",

In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure 'first-to-market' or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nSome of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.\n\nMany of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta is available as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, and our AutoTouch reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates and products, including LUMAKRAS, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device.

When approval of the product and device  is  sought  under  a  single  marketing  drug  application,  the  increased  complexity  of  the  review  process  may  delay  receipt  of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party  companies  continuing  to  meet  applicable  regulatory  or  other  requirements.  Failure  to  successfully  develop,  modify,  or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for  existing  products.  We  are  also  required  to  collect  and  assess  user  complaints,  adverse  events  and  malfunctions  regarding  our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For  example,  in  2017,  the  FDA  reported  on  its  adverse  event  reporting  system  that  it  was  evaluating  our  Neulasta  Onpro  kit. Subsequently,  we  implemented  device  and  labeling  enhancements  to  address  product  complaints  received  on  this  device.  We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully  develop,  supply,  or  gain  or  maintain  approval  for  these  devices  could  adversely  affect  sales  of  the  related  approved products.\n\nSome of our pharmaceutical pipeline  and  our  commercial  product  sales  rely  on  collaborations  with  third  parties,  which  may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.\n\nWe  depend  on  alliances  with  other  companies,  including  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  companies,  vendors  and  service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business-Business Relationships.\n\nFailures  by  these  parties  to  meet  their  contractual,  regulatory,  or  other  obligations  to  us  or  any  disruption  in  the  relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&amp;D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership  or  prosecution  of  intellectual  property  and  associated  rights  and  obligations.  This  could  result  in  the  loss  of  intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.",

      "question": "How did Johnson & Johnson's financial obligations under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan evolve between fiscal years 2019 and 2021, and how does this reflect the company's broader equity compensation strategy as evidenced by plan disclosures and executive award agreements?",
      "answer": "Between fiscal years 2019 and 2021, Johnson & Johnson's financial obligations under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan increased from $977 million to $1,135 million in compensation costs, with corresponding tax benefits rising from $227 million to $218 million during the same period. This upward trend indicates a growing emphasis on equity-based compensation. The company had 240 million shares available for future grants under the plan at the end of fiscal year 2021, showing continued capacity for equity incentives. Furthermore, the existence of specific award agreements under the plan, such as Global NonQualified Stock Option Award Agreements and Global Restricted Share Unit Award Agreements, demonstrates a structured approach to executive compensation that aligns with the increased financial commitments observed in the plan disclosures.",

The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1 million after-tax.\n\n## 16. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\n\nAt January 2, 2022, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 240 million at the end of fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $1,135 million, $1,005 million and $977 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $218 million, $210 million and $227 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $223 million, $248 million and $209 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $862 million, $804 million and $823 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,",

      "question": "How does the expiration of the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan impact Johnson & Johnson's equity compensation structure, as reflected in the plan disclosures, share availability under the 2012 plan, and the financial impact of stock-based compensation expenses over the past three fiscal years?",
      "answer": "The expiration of the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan in April 2012 shifted all new equity grants to the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which now governs all outstanding equity awards. As of fiscal year 2021, the 2012 Plan had 240 million shares available for future grants, incorporating unused shares from the 2005 Plan. Financial data shows that stock-based compensation costs were $1,135 million in 2021, $1,005 million in 2020, and $977 million in 2019, indicating a growing financial impact of these plans. These figures, combined with the disclosure that the 2005 Plan is no longer issuing new awards, show a clear transition in the company's equity compensation structure toward reliance on the 2012 Plan.",

      "question": "What is the full business and strategic significance of STELARA (ustekinumab) to Johnson & Johnson when considering its pediatric indication pipeline, revenue contribution, and intellectual property expiration timeline?",
      "answer": "STELARA (ustekinumab) is a critical product for Johnson & Johnson, with multiple dimensions of strategic importance. First, it is being expanded into new therapeutic areas, including pediatric indications such as juvenile psoriatic arthritis, as noted in the product pipeline. Second, STELARA contributed $9.134 billion in revenue in 2021, representing a significant portion of the company's Immunology portfolio and total pharmaceutical sales. Third, the product's intellectual property is time-sensitive, with the latest expiring U.S. composition of matter patent set to expire in 2023 and the European counterpart in 2024. This impending patent cliff creates urgency around lifecycle management and potential biosimilar competition, even as the company seeks to extend its market presence through new indications in pediatric populations.",

        "Hop 1: JNJ (page_32) \u2192 STELARA: STELARA is listed in the product table with a new filing for the treatment of pediatric patients with juvenile psoriatic arthritis, indicating pipeline development and strategic expansion into younger patient populations.",
        "Hop 2: JNJ (page_9) \u2192 STELARA: STELARA is identified as Johnson & Johnson's largest product, contributing approximately 9.7% of total revenues in fiscal 2021. The patent ownership and expiration timeline (U.S. 2023, EU 2024) are highlighted, signaling material IP risk.",

          "chunk_text": "claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, 'Legal Proceedings-Intellectual Property' of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nSales of the Company's largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.7% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA . The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent expires in 2024. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nSales of the Company's second largest product, collectively DARZALEX  (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 6.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO . \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.\n\n## Competition\n\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company's consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\n\n## Environment\n\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company's compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe Company's businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.\n\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company's subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\n\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Medtronic reported $150 million in medical device regulations expenses in the non-GAAP adjustments table, which reduced net income by $120 million. In fiscal year 2024, this amount decreased to $119 million in the non-GAAP adjustments, reducing net income by $97 million. This aligns with the operating profit section, which shows medical device regulations expenses of $119 million in fiscal year 2024, $150 million in fiscal year 2023, and $102 million in fiscal year 2022. The decrease from $150 million to $119 million between fiscal years 2023 and 2024 indicates a reduction in regulatory expenses, consistent across both reporting formats.",

      "answer": "The fair value of Medtronic's currency exchange rate contracts resulted in a $136 million gain during fiscal 2024, as reported in the income statement under 'Other operating expense (income), net'. This gain reflects the effectiveness of these contracts in offsetting foreign exchange exposure. As of April 26, 2024, the total notional amount of these contracts was $10.4 billion for cash flow hedges and $7.4 billion for net investment hedges, indicating a strategic use of derivatives to manage both short-term transactional and long-term translational currency risks. On the balance sheet, these contracts had a net asset position of $168 million after accounting for $189 million in offsetting amounts and $11 million in cash collateral, showing that despite the large notional exposure, the net impact on the balance sheet was relatively small and well-collateralized.",

      "answer": "Medtronic's operations in the Dominican Republic include a physical footprint of 395 thousand square feet, placing it among other key international locations. The company benefits from tax incentive grants in the Dominican Republic that have been active since at least fiscal year 2020, contributing to a favorable tax impact of $229 million, $115 million, and $248 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively. These incentives are set to expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2049 unless extended, and while the expired grants in fiscal year 2024 had no material impact, the ongoing incentives remain a key factor in the company's tax planning and operational strategy in the region.",

While the Opinion rejected  the  IRS's  position  and  the  Tax   Court  determined  the  methodology  advanced  by  Medtronic  was  appropriate  for  purposes  of  determining  the intercompany royalty rate between Puerto Rico and the U.S., it determined that the royalty rate should be higher, thereby increasing income allocated to the U.S. and consequently subject to U.S. tax. This case relates only to fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Company has assumed the Tax Court findings will be applied for all years following fiscal year 2006.\n- A cost of $55 million related to the disallowance of certain interest deductions.\n- A cost of $30 million related to the change in reporting currency for certain carryover attributes.\n- A cost of $28 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n- A net cost of $33 million primarily associated with the sale of half of the Company's RCS business.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the net benefit from certain tax  adjustments of $50 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:\n\n- A benefit of $82 million associated with a step up in tax  basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes.\n- A benefit of $82 million related to a change in tax  rates on intangible assets.\n- A cost of $47 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n- A cost of $41 million associated with a change in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings.\n- A net cost of $26 million primarily associated with an intercompany sale of assets.\n\nCurrently, the Company's operations in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and China have various tax holidays and tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by $229 million, $115 million, and $248 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and diluted earnings per share by $0.17, $0.09, and $0.18, in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon the Company meeting certain thresholds required under statutory law. The tax incentive grants, unless extended, will expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2049. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2024 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15% in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2025. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. There are no impacts of this global minimum tax in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024.",

Diabetes' sales for fiscal year 2024 were $2.5 billion, an increase of 10 percent as compared to fiscal year 2023. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by strong international growth as a result of the continued international expansion of the MiniMed 780G  insulin pump system and integrated CGM. The launch of the MiniMed 780G  insulin pump system in the U.S., during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, also contributed to the net sales growth.\n\nIn addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Net Sales section, looking ahead we expect Diabetes could be affected by the following:\n\n- Continued acceptance and growth for the MiniMed 780G insulin pump system, which is powered by SmartG uard technology and features the added benefits of meal detection technology that automatically adjusts and corrects sugar levels every five minutes. The global adoption of our Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) systems has resulted in strong sensor attachment rates. The MiniMed 780G  insulin pump system with the G uardian 4 Sensor was approved by the U.S. FDA in late April 2023. The MiniMed 780G insulin pump system with Simplera Sync received CE Mark in early January 2024.\n- Continued acceptance and growth of the Guardian Connect CGM system, which displays glucose information directly to a smartphone to provide patients access to their glucose levels seamlessly and discretely. The Guardian Connect CGM system is available on both Apple iOS and Android devices.\n- Market acceptance and growth of our InPen smart pen system, which allows users to have their Medtronic CGM readings in real-time alongside insulin dose information, all in one view.\n- Continued pump, CGM, and consumable competition in an expanding global market.\n- Changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs, along with additional payor coverage on insulin pumps.\n- Our ability to meet growing demand for our existing products and to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize the products within our pipeline, including our next-generation sensor Simplera, which has been submitted for approval to the U.S. FDA and received CE Mark in September 2023.",

      "answer": "AbbVie's acquisition of Allergan, which involved a total consideration of $64.084 billion, significantly shaped its financial structure and operational strategy. The integration plan, expected to incur approximately $2 billion in charges through 2022, contributed to cost management efforts that helped improve gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2021. This improvement was partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets tied to the acquisition. Meanwhile, the indefinite-lived intangible assets from the Allergan acquisition\u2014primarily related to in-process R&D\u2014required ongoing impairment assessments, highlighting the long-term financial exposure and strategic risk associated with the deal. Together, these elements show how the Allergan acquisition simultaneously affected AbbVie's profitability metrics, cost structure, and asset valuation.",

Cash payments for income taxes were $1.83 billion during 2024.\n\nDuring 2023, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. A decrease in inventories provided cash of $0.60 billion. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $0.50 billion, and changes in other assets and liabilities used cash of $0.80 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.48 billion during 2023.\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading 'Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters' in Note 5 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nDuring 2024, the acquisition of Olink Holding AB (publ) used cash of $3.13 billion. The company's investing activities also included net purchases of investments of $1.63 billion, primarily to provide additional interest income, as well as $1.40 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments.\n\nDuring 2023, acquisitions of The Binding Site Group and CorEvitas, LLC used cash of $2.70 billion and $0.91 billion, respectively.

          "chunk_text": "\nSince 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. Since the company's acquisition of PPD in December 2021, the clinical research business has continued to play a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for COV ID-19 vaccines and therapies. These positive impacts continued at much lower levels in 2024 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declined. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $0.10 billion and $0.33 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nDuring 2024, all of our end markets were negatively impacted by a more muted macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in China. Revenues from pharma and biotech and diagnostics and healthcare customers were also negatively impacted by reduced demand for COVID-19 related products and services. As a result, revenues in these end markets declined slightly in the year. Revenues in the academic and government and industrial and applied markets increased slightly as we saw the benefits of our investments into high-impact innovation. During 2024, all geographies were negatively impacted by the more muted macroeconomic environment. Sales grew slightly in Asia-Pacific, including China. Sales growth in Europe was flat and sales in North America declined slightly due to decreased demand for COVID-19 related products. Contributions to organic revenue during 2024 from the Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments were offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions segment.\n\nThe company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:\n\n- High-impact innovation,\n- Our trusted partner status with customers, and\n- Our unparalleled commercial engine.\n\nGAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in 2024 due primarily to unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, partially offset by productivity improvements. The decreases in GAAP operating income margin during 2024 were more than offset by lower levels of amortization expense. We estimate that charges for restructuring and related actions incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations, which resulted in charges of approximately $0.3 billion in 2024 and $0.3 billion in 2023, will realize annual cost savings of approx imately $0.2 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, primarily due to reduced employee and facility expenses.\n\nThe company's references to strategic investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company's references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system to address inflation, including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.\n\n## Notable Recent Acquisitions\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment's portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma.\n\nOn August 14, 2023, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, CorEvitas, LLC, a U.S.-based provider of regulatorygrade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies.

The acquisition enhances the segment's capabilities in the high-growth proteomics market with the addition of highly differentiated solutions.

      "answer": "Pfizer's divestiture of its early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio to Alexion for up to $1 billion, including a $300 million upfront payment and contingent milestone payments, aligns with its strategic pivot away from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches toward next-generation technologies like mRNA and in vivo gene editing. This move is consistent with Pfizer's broader strategy of optimizing its portfolio through targeted divestitures while simultaneously pursuing strategic acquisitions, such as the $2.0 billion acquisition of Seagen in December 2023. The Seagen acquisition significantly expanded Pfizer\u2019s oncology capabilities by adding antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and other modalities to its portfolio, reinforcing its commitment to building a diversified and innovative pipeline. Together, these actions reflect a deliberate reallocation of capital and resources to focus on high-potential therapeutic areas and platforms, while monetizing non-core assets through structured partnerships like the one with Alexion.",

      "question": "How does Pfizer's financial and operational treatment of its Comirnaty-related manufacturing relationship with BioNTech differ across revenue reporting, balance sheet liabilities, and business innovation performance metrics?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's Comirnaty-related manufacturing relationship with BioNTech is reflected differently across three sections of the 10-K. In revenue reporting (page 112), Pfizer notes that Comirnaty manufacturing activities for BioNTech generated $33 million in 2023, down from $188 million in 2022 and $320 million in 2021, indicating a declining trend in this revenue stream. On the balance sheet (page 90), the company disclosed a payable of $2.0 billion to BioNTech for the gross profit split on Comirnaty as of December 31, 2023, down from $5.2 billion in the prior year, suggesting a significant reduction in outstanding obligations. In the Business Innovation segment performance (page 45), the decline in Comirnaty supply to BioNTech is cited as a primary driver of a 2% operational revenue decrease, showing the direct impact of this relationship on segment performance. Together, these perspectives illustrate how the evolving Comirnaty manufacturing arrangement affects Pfizer's revenue recognition, liability structure, and strategic business unit performance.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Comirnaty's global revenue in 2023 reconcile with the ongoing strategic collaboration with BioNTech and the transition to commercial market sales in the U.S.?",
      "answer": "Comirnaty's global revenue dropped by 70% in 2023, driven by lower contracted deliveries and demand internationally and the transition to commercial market sales in the U.S., which began in September 2023. Despite this decline, the strategic collaboration with BioNTech remains active, with both companies sharing development costs and gross profits globally, excluding Germany, Turkey, and certain Asian territories. The transition to commercial sales in the U.S., as noted in the revenue commentary and the overall revenue decrease from the U.S. government, aligns with the shift from government-led procurement to traditional market dynamics, which contributed to the revenue drop but supports long-term sustainability in vaccine commercialization.",

      "answer": "The expiration of Noxafil's European patent in December 2019 led to a 21% decline in global sales in 2021, primarily due to generic competition in Europe, partially offset by increased demand in China. In contrast, the U.S. patent expiration in July 2019 caused a 50% global sales decline in 2020. This shows that the U.S. market was more impactful to Noxafil's revenue erosion than Europe in the initial year post-expiration. Internationally, Noxafil's sales decline contributed to the broader pharmaceutical segment's international performance, which also saw reduced sales of other hospital acute care products like Zerbaxa, while being partially offset by growth in Bridion and Prevymis. This aligns with Merck's segment dynamics where Noxafil's patent losses fit into a larger trend of competitive pressure and shifting demand in international markets.",

The patent that provided market exclusivity  for Noxafil in  a  number  of  major  European  markets  expired  in  December  2019.  As  a  result,  the  Company  is experiencing lower demand for Noxafil in  these  markets due to generic competition and expects the decline to continue. Global sales of Noxafil declined 50% in 2020 due to generic competition in the U.S. and in Europe. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for certain forms of Noxafil representing the majority of U.S. Noxafil sales expired in July 2019.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  Company  temporarily  suspended  sales  of Zerbaxa ,  a  combination  antibacterial  and  betalactamase  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  certain  bacterial  infections,  and  subsequently  issued  a  product  recall,  following  the identification of product sterility issues. As a result, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in 2020 related to Zerbaxa (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, which the Company expects to continue during 2022.\n\n## Immunology\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2021, Janumet generated $1,964 million in total sales, with $367 million in the U.S. and $1,597 million internationally, indicating a strong international presence. This geographic distribution showed that the product was more dominant in international markets, particularly in China, which was noted as a key market facing loss of exclusivity. The U.S., EU, and China accounted for 33%, 24%, and 9% of combined Januvia and Janumet sales, respectively, and the Company anticipated substantial declines in sales in these regions after losing market exclusivity\u2014January 2023 in the U.S., September 2022 in the EU, and July 2022 in China\u2014due to expected generic competition. Positioned within Merck\u2019s diabetes portfolio alongside Januvia, Janumet\u2019s sales trajectory and patent cliff underscored a significant near-term risk to Merck\u2019s revenue in this therapeutic category.",

Sales performance in both periods reflects continued pricing pressure and lower demand in the U.S., largely offset by higher demand in certain international markets, particularly in China. The Company expects U.S. pricing pressure to continue. Januvia and Janumet will lose market exclusivity in the U.S. in January 2023, in the EU in September 2022, and in China in July 2022. The Company anticipates sales of Januvia and Janumet in these markets will decline substantially after the loss of exclusivity.

      "answer": "In 2021, M-M-R II generated $2,135 million in global sales, with 3% year-over-year growth driven by higher U.S. demand during the pandemic recovery, despite lower European demand. In contrast, Gardasil/Gardasil 9 achieved $5,673 million in sales with a significant 44% growth, fueled by strong global demand, especially in China, and pricing increases. ProQuad also saw a 14% rise in sales to $2,135 million, primarily due to increased U.S. demand and higher pricing. While M-M-R II's growth was modest compared to the robust expansion of Gardasil/Gardasil 9, its recovery in the U.S. market underscores its continued relevance in Merck's vaccine portfolio, especially in public sector immunization programs.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWorldwide sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9, vaccines to help prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), grew 44% in 2021 driven primarily by strong global demand, particularly in China, as well as  increased  supply.  Higher  pricing  in  China  and  the  U.S.  also  contributed  to  sales  growth  in  2021.  Sales  growth  in  2021  was unfavorably affected by the replenishment in 2020 of doses borrowed from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile, which favorably affected sales by $120 million in 2020. The timing of public sector purchases in the U.S. also partially offset sales growth in 2021. Global sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 grew 5% in 2020 primarily due to higher volumes  in  China  and  the  replenishment  in  2020  of  doses  borrowed  from  the  CDC  Pediatric  Vaccine  Stockpile  in  2019.  The replenishment resulted in the recognition of sales of $120 million in 2020, which, when combined with the reduction of sales of $120 million in 2019 due to the borrowing, resulted in a favorable impact to sales of $240 million in 2020 compared with 2019. Lower demand in the U.S. and Hong Kong, SAR, PRC attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset the increase in sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in 2020.\n\nThe Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9. Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, Merck pays a 7% royalty on worldwide sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 to one third party (royalty obligations under this agreement expire in December 2023) and an additional 7% royalty on sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in the U.S. to another third party (these royalty obligations expire in December 2028). The royalties are included in Cost of sales .\n\nGlobal sales of ProQuad , a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, grew 14% in 2021 due to higher sales in the U.S. reflecting higher demand driven by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic recovery, as  well  as  higher  pricing.  Worldwide  sales  of ProQuad declined  10%  in  2020  driven  primarily  by  lower  demand  in  the  U.S. resulting  from  fewer  measles  outbreaks  in  2020  compared  with  2019,  coupled  with  the  unfavorable  impact  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher pricing.\n\nWorldwide sales of M-M-R II, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, grew 3% in 2021 primarily due  to  higher  sales  in  the  U.S.  reflecting  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  recovery  inclusive  of  higher  public  sector  mix  of business. Lower demand in Europe partially offset M-M-R II sales growth in 2021. Global sales of M-M-R II declined 31% in 2020 driven primarily by lower demand in the U.S. resulting from fewer",

Regionally, this growth was evident in both U.S. and international markets, with U.S. sales increasing from $119 million in 2020 to $153 million in 2021, and international sales rising from $162 million to $218 million over the same period. This upward trend aligns with Merck's broader hospital acute care product portfolio, where Prevymis was one of the contributors to growth, alongside products like Bridion, despite declines in other products such as Noxafil and Zerbaxa.",

The patent that provided market exclusivity  for Noxafil in  a  number  of  major  European  markets  expired  in  December  2019.  As  a  result,  the  Company  is experiencing lower demand for Noxafil in  these  markets due to generic competition and expects the decline to continue. Global sales of Noxafil declined 50% in 2020 due to generic competition in the U.S. and in Europe. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for certain forms of Noxafil representing the majority of U.S. Noxafil sales expired in July 2019.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  Company  temporarily  suspended  sales  of Zerbaxa ,  a  combination  antibacterial  and  betalactamase  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  certain  bacterial  infections,  and  subsequently  issued  a  product  recall,  following  the identification of product sterility issues. As a result, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in 2020 related to Zerbaxa (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, which the Company expects to continue during 2022.\n\n## Immunology\n\n",

International sales represented 54% and 53% of total sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWorldwide sales increased 6% in 2020 primarily due to higher sales in the oncology franchise, as well as growth in certain  hospital  acute  care  products  and  animal  health.

      "answer": "Januvia's sales trajectory shows a flattening in 2021 and a 4% decline in 2020, primarily due to U.S. pricing pressure and reduced demand, partially offset by growth in international markets, especially China. In 2021, U.S., EU, and China represented 33%, 24%, and 9% of combined Januvia and Janumet sales, respectively. With the loss of exclusivity in China (July 2022), the EU (September 2022), and the U.S. (January 2023), the Company expects a substantial decline in sales in these key markets, which together constituted the majority of its global revenue base for the drug.",

In August 2024, BMY announced the submission of the Japanese New Drug Application for Inrebic for the treatment of myelofibrosis, based on global Phase III and Phase II trial data (page_71). This indicates strong clinical validation and expansion potential in international markets. On the financial side, Inrebic is grouped among 'Other growth products' alongside Onureg, Nulojix, Empliciti, and royalty revenues, suggesting it contributes to a broader portfolio segment that is being leveraged for sustained revenue growth (page_53). Furthermore, Inrebic is included in a category that generates alliance-related revenues, indicating its role in collaborative commercial strategies and its contribution to contract assets tied to future royalties (page_87). Together, these perspectives show that Inrebic is positioned as a clinically validated product with growing commercial relevance, particularly in international and partnered markets.",

      "answer": "Yervoy is set to lose its minimum market exclusivity in the U.S. by 2025, which raises concerns about potential generic or biosimilar competition entering the market in the near future. In 2023, Yervoy generated $2,530 million in revenue, showing a 13% growth compared to the prior year, with particularly strong performance in the U.S. market. This growth comes despite the looming expiration of exclusivity, which aligns with the broader risk environment described in the filing\u2014generic and biosimilar challenges are increasing, and regulatory frameworks in both the U.S. and EU are evolving in ways that may accelerate market entry of competitors. Thus, while Yervoy remains a growing asset for BMY, the short window of exclusivity left suggests that the company may soon face competitive pressures that could materially affect future revenue streams.",

          "chunk_text": "An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovator's NDA is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the generic product. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV  certification. The innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, ANDAs including Paragraph IV  certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these ANDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines can also receive several types of regulatory exclusivity. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, a generic manufacturer may file its ANDA after the fourth year  of  the  five-year  regulatory  ex clusivity  period.  Our  marketed  chemical  products  include Eliquis,  Revlimid,  Pomalyst,  Sprycel,  Zeposia,  Camzyos,  Sotyktu , Augtyro, Krazati, and Cobenfy .\n\n## Biologic products (includes CAR-T cell therapy products)\n\nQualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative  biological  product  was  first  approved  by  the  FDA.  Our  marketed  biologic  products  include Opdivo , Opdivo  Qvantig, Orencia, Yervoy,  Reblozyl, Opdualag, Breyanzi, Abecma and Abraxane.\n\nIn the U.S., medicines (chemically synthesized or biologically derived) may also receive an additional six months of market exclusivity (added to certain patent terms and regulatory exclusivities) if certain agreed-upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market ex clusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions may limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory ex clusivity.\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended for up to five years to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 15 years from the date of drug approval. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis. The EU provides an additional six months of exclusivity added to the extended patent term if certain pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized  procedure.'  This  procedure  is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA.\n\nAfter obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout  the  EU,  all  products  for  which  marketing  authorizations  have  been  filed  after  October  and  November  2005  are  subject  to  an  '8+2+1'  regulatory exclusivity regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with ex isting treatments.",

      "question": "Given Abraxane's 13% decline in total revenue in 2024 and its classification as a biologic with 12-year regulatory exclusivity, how does the lack of a defined minimum market exclusivity date in key markets affect Bristol-Myers Squibb's ability to sustain revenue from the product amid increasing generic and biosimilar threats?",
      "answer": "Abraxane, a biologic product, benefits from a 12-year regulatory exclusivity period in the U.S., which typically shields it from biosimilar competition. However, the 2024 financial data shows a 13% decline in revenue (from $1,004 million to $875 million), with a significant drop in U.S. sales (-23%). Despite the regulatory protections, the absence of a defined minimum market exclusivity date in key markets\u2014evident from the blank entries for Abraxane in the exclusivity table\u2014suggests uncertainty in the timeline of future market protection. This lack of clarity, combined with increasing generic and biosimilar challenges outlined in the risk section, raises concerns about BMY's ability to sustain Abraxane's revenue over the long term, even with the statutory 12-year exclusivity framework.",

          "chunk_text": "An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovator's NDA is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the generic product. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV  certification. The innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, ANDAs including Paragraph IV  certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these ANDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines can also receive several types of regulatory exclusivity. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, a generic manufacturer may file its ANDA after the fourth year  of  the  five-year  regulatory  ex clusivity  period.  Our  marketed  chemical  products  include Eliquis,  Revlimid,  Pomalyst,  Sprycel,  Zeposia,  Camzyos,  Sotyktu , Augtyro, Krazati, and Cobenfy .\n\n## Biologic products (includes CAR-T cell therapy products)\n\nQualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative  biological  product  was  first  approved  by  the  FDA.  Our  marketed  biologic  products  include Opdivo , Opdivo  Qvantig, Orencia, Yervoy,  Reblozyl, Opdualag, Breyanzi, Abecma and Abraxane.\n\nIn the U.S., medicines (chemically synthesized or biologically derived) may also receive an additional six months of market exclusivity (added to certain patent terms and regulatory exclusivities) if certain agreed-upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market ex clusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions may limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory ex clusivity.\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended for up to five years to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 15 years from the date of drug approval. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis. The EU provides an additional six months of exclusivity added to the extended patent term if certain pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized  procedure.'  This  procedure  is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA.\n\nAfter obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout  the  EU,  all  products  for  which  marketing  authorizations  have  been  filed  after  October  and  November  2005  are  subject  to  an  '8+2+1'  regulatory exclusivity regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with ex isting treatments.",

      "answer": "Ozurdex demonstrated strong international growth in 2023 with a 15.9% increase in international revenue (from $289M in 2022 to $329M in 2023), contrasting with modest U.S. growth (up 2.7% to $143M), indicating a strategic shift toward international expansion. This aligns with its therapeutic positioning as a corticosteroid implant indicated for diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and non-infectious uveitis\u2014conditions with significant global prevalence. Despite being one of several eye care products, Ozurdex is one of the few AbbVie eye therapies available in numerous global markets, highlighting its strategic importance in diversifying the company's geographic footprint and addressing chronic ophthalmic inflammation.",

      "question": "How does AbbVie's collaboration structure with Genentech for Venclexta reflect in both its financial obligations and revenue performance across U.S. and international markets?",
      "answer": "AbbVie's collaboration with Genentech for Venclexta involves equal pre-tax profit and loss sharing in the U.S., while AbbVie pays royalties on net revenues outside the U.S. This structure is reflected in AbbVie's financial obligations, with a payable of $307 million to Genentech at the end of 2023. Financially, Venclexta generated $1,087 million in U.S. revenue and $1,201 million in international revenue in 2023, indicating a balanced contribution between domestic and foreign markets. The collaboration model directly impacts AbbVie\u2019s cost of products sold, which includes both Genentech\u2019s share of U.S. profits and international royalties, shaping the company\u2019s overall profitability and financial commitments tied to Venclexta.",

      "question": "How does Abbott's use of $2.9 billion in interest rate hedge contracts align with the changes in their fair value and carrying value positions in 2021, and what does this imply about their interest rate exposure management strategy?",
      "answer": "Abbott held $2.9 billion in interest rate hedge contracts in 2021 and 2020 to convert fixed-rate debt obligations into variable-rate obligations, as disclosed in the financial instruments section. These contracts were designated as fair value hedges, with their fair value adjustments directly impacting the carrying value of the associated fixed-rate debt. In 2021, the fair value of Abbott\u2019s interest rate hedge contracts was $87 million (receivable position), compared to $210 million in 2020, indicating a significant decline in the value of these contracts. This decline suggests that interest rates likely rose during the year, reducing the fair value of the hedge contracts. Despite this, Abbott\u2019s strategy remained consistent, using these instruments to manage interest rate exposure on fixed-rate debt without materially affecting cash flows or income. The alignment of these facts shows Abbott\u2019s active management of interest rate risk through derivative instruments while maintaining a stable debt structure.",

These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  amounts  and  location  of  certain  derivative  financial  instruments  as  of December 31:\n\n",

The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 - A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nUnder the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental,  technological  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  Abbott's  operations  are  discussed  in  Item  1A,  Risk Factors.\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Financial Instruments and Risk Management\n\n## Market Price Sensitive Investments\n\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $11 million and $20 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2021 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in  earnings.  The  fair  value  of  investments  in  mutual  funds  that  are  held  in  a  rabbi  trust  for  the  purpose  of  paying benefits  under  a  deferred  compensation  plan  was  approximately  $391  million  and  $366  million  as  of  December  31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  investments,  as  well  as  an  offsetting  change  in  the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities\n\nAbbott  holds  equity  securities  that  are  not  traded  on  public  stock  exchanges.  The  carrying  value  of  these investments  was  $90  million  and  $113  million  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  No  individual investment  is  recorded  at  a  value  in  excess  of  $15  million.  Abbott  measures  these  investments  at  cost  minus impairment,  if  any,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nAt  December  31,  2021  and  2020, Abbott  had  interest  rate  hedge  contracts  totaling  $2.9  billion  to  manage  its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at  December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $21.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.4% and 3.3% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\n\n## Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  for  anticipated  intercompany  purchases  by  those  subsidiaries  whose  functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2021 will mature in 2022 or 2023 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2020 matured in 2021 or will mature in 2022 depending upon the contract.",

      "question": "How does Abbott\u2019s use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge intercompany transactions and trade payables align with the fair value changes reported in their financial statements and the impact on cost of products sold?",
      "answer": "Abbott uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge intercompany transactions and trade payables, with gross notional amounts of $12.2 billion at the end of 2021. These contracts are marked to fair value, and as of December 31, 2021, the fair value of these contracts was $292 million in assets and $97 million in liabilities. The gains and losses on these contracts flow into the income statement, specifically impacting the cost of products sold. In 2021, a loss of $252 million was reclassified into income under 'Cost of products sold' from previously recognized gains in other comprehensive income. This indicates that the company\u2019s hedging strategy directly affects its profitability metrics, with the timing of reclassification aligning with product sales.",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 10 - Leases (Continued)\n\n## Leases where Abbott is the Lessor\n\nCertain  assets,  primarily  diagnostics  instruments,  are  leased  to  customers  under  contractual  arrangements  that typically  include  an  operating  or  sales-type  lease  as  well  as  performance  obligations  for  reagents  and  other consumables.  Sales-type  leases  are  not  significant.  Contract  terms  vary  by  customer  and  may  include  options  to terminate  the  contract  or  options  to  extend  the  contract.  Where  instruments  are  provided  under  operating  lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g.,  reagent)  sales.  The  allocation  of  revenue  between  the  lease  and  non-lease  components  is  based  on  standalone selling  prices.  Operating  lease  revenue  represented  less  than  3  percent  of Abbott's  total  net  sales  in  the  years  ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nAssets related  to  operating  leases  are  reported  within  Net  property  and  equipment  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $3.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $3.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Note 11 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  primarily  for  anticipated  intercompany  purchases  by  those  subsidiaries  whose functional  currencies  are  not  the  U.S.  dollar.  These  contracts,  with  gross  notional  amounts  totaling  $8.6  billion  at December 31, 2021, and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months.\n\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the  receivable  or  payable  is  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the  entity.  For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held gross  notional  amounts  of  $12.2  billion  and  $11.0  billion,  respectively,  of  such  foreign  currency  forward  exchange contracts.\n\nIn November 2019, Abbott borrowed \u00a559.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan  as  a  hedge  of  the  net  investment  in  certain  foreign  subsidiaries.  The  proceeds  equated  to  approximately  $550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $521 million and $577 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",

      "question": "How does Abbott incorporate country risk into its accounts receivable valuations, and how does this approach align with its broader credit risk monitoring framework and working capital management?",
      "answer": "Abbott integrates country risk into its accounts receivable valuations by factoring it into the allowance for doubtful accounts, which reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the receivables. This is explicitly mentioned in both the detailed accounting policy section and the balance sheet component analysis, where country risk is listed as a forward-looking factor in determining credit limits and allowances. Furthermore, in the working capital section, Abbott notes that it monitors the creditworthiness of customers and adjusts allowances based on various risk factors, including country risk. The alignment between these perspectives shows a consistent credit risk monitoring framework that incorporates macroeconomic factors like country risk into both short-term financial asset valuations and broader liquidity planning. This approach supports Abbott\u2019s working capital strategy, as demonstrated by the $11.1 billion in working capital at the end of 2021, which reflects disciplined credit and liquidity risk management.",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS - For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets,  total  fair  value  is  the  published  market  price  per  unit  multiplied  by  the  number  of  units  held  without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION - The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized  over  their  requisite  service  period,  which  could  be  shorter  than  the  vesting  period  if  an  employee  is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense.\n\nLITIGATION - Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, 'Contingencies.' Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS - Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities,  money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $256 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\n\nTRADE  RECEIVABLE  VALUATIONS  -  Accounts  receivable  are  stated  at  the  net  amount  expected  to  be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the  life  of  the  accounts  receivable.  Abbott  considers  various  factors  in  establishing,  monitoring,  and  adjusting  its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of chargeoffs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\n\nINVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs.\n\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Working Capital\n\nWorking capital was $11.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was due  in  large  part  to  the  higher  level  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  which  was  due  primarily  to  the  increase  in  cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by the classification of $750 million of Senior Notes due 2022 as current liabilities at December 31, 2021 and an increase in accounts payable associated with the growth of the business.\n\nAbbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of  credit  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  financial  asset.  Abbott  considers  various  factors  in establishing,  monitoring,  and  adjusting  its  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts,  including  the  aging  of  the  accounts  and aging  trends,  the  historical  level  of  charge-offs,  and  specific  exposures  related  to  particular  customers. Abbott  also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nCapital  expenditures  of  $1.9  billion  in  2021,  $2.2  billion  in  2020  and  $1.6  billion  in  2019  were  principally  for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. The 2020 increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects the building of capacity for the manufacture of COVID-19 diagnostics tests.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nAbbott believes that its available cash and cash equivalents along with its ability to generate operating cash flow and continued access to debt markets are sufficient to fund existing and planned cash requirements. Abbott's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\n\nDebt -  Principal  payments  required  on  long-term  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  are  $754  million  in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2023, $1.2 billion in 2024, $1.5 billion in 2025, $3.0 billion in 2026 and $9.3 billion in 2027 and thereafter. Interest payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 are $579 million in 2022, $569 million in 2023, $526 million in 2024, $494 million in 2025, $463 million in 2026 and $5.8 billion in 2027 and thereafter.\n\nOperating leases - As of December 31, 2021, estimated contractual obligations for operating lease payments were $1.351 billion, with $272 million due within 12 months.\n\nIn  addition, Abbott enters into purchase commitments in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. The majority of outstanding purchase commitments generally do not extend past one year.\n\n## Contingent Obligations\n\nAbbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Legislative Issues\n\nAbbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for  Income  Taxes ,  which  among  other  things, eliminates  certain  exceptions  in  the  current  rules  regarding  the  approach  for  intraperiod  tax  allocations  and  the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.",

      "answer": "Veklury sales declined in 2023, contributing to an overall 1% decrease in total revenues to $27.1 billion. This decline occurred despite expanded regulatory approvals for Veklury, including FDA and EC authorization for treating appropriate patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment, including those on dialysis. Within Gilead's broader product portfolio, Veklury is listed among key marketed products, but its performance contrasted with growth in HIV and Oncology products, which partially offset the revenue drop from Veklury.

      "question": "Given Biktarvy's increasing revenue dominance as Gilead's top-selling product and its reliance on the latest expiring compound patent among its active ingredients, how does this revenue trajectory align with the patent expiration framework described for Gilead's principal products, and what implications might this have for the company's long-term growth strategy?",
      "answer": "Biktarvy's revenue dominance grew significantly, increasing from $8.624 billion in 2021 to $11.850 billion in 2023, making it a cornerstone of Gilead\u2019s revenue portfolio. This growth trajectory positions Biktarvy as a key driver of the company's financial performance. However, according to Gilead\u2019s patent expiration framework, the patent protection for Biktarvy is determined by the latest expiring compound patent among its active ingredients, which introduces a specific risk factor for the product's long-term revenue sustainability. Given that Biktarvy is a fixed-dose combination product, its patent expiration date hinges on the longest-lasting patent of its individual components, potentially leaving it vulnerable to generic competition once that patent expires. This dynamic creates a critical dependency on the timing and enforceability of this final expiring patent. As Gilead focuses on advancing innovative medicines to treat life-threatening diseases, the company must balance Biktarvy's current revenue contributions with strategic investments in its broader R&D pipeline to ensure sustained growth beyond the patent lifecycle of this key product.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GILD (page_9) \u2192 Biktarvy: Gilead's patent expiration framework specifies that for fixed-dose combinations like Biktarvy, the patent expiration date corresponds to the latest expiring compound patent among its active ingredients.",
        "Hop 2: GILD (page_58) \u2192 Biktarvy: Biktarvy is listed as one of Gilead's principal marketed products, aligning with the company\u2019s strategic focus on innovative medicines for life-threatening diseases, including HIV.",
        "Hop 3: GILD (page_65) \u2192 Biktarvy: Biktarvy's revenue dominance is evident, growing from $8.624 billion in 2021 to $11.850 billion in 2023, making it the company's top-selling product."

      "question": "How does the 22% year-over-year revenue decline for Truvada in 2023 inform Gilead's strategic positioning of the product in light of its upcoming patent expiration and the broader competitive dynamics within its HIV portfolio?",
      "answer": "Truvada, which saw a 22% revenue decline in 2023 (from $147 million to $114 million), is listed among Gilead\u2019s marketed HIV products (page 58), indicating its ongoing role in the company\u2019s HIV portfolio despite declining sales. The patent expiration table (page 9) reveals that Truvada\u2019s primary patent expiration dates are approaching, which aligns with the observed revenue drop, likely due to increased generic competition or market shift. Within the broader HIV segment (page 40), Biktarvy grew by 14% to $11.85 billion in 2023, suggesting that Gilead is increasingly relying on newer, higher-performing products to offset declines in legacy therapies like Truvada. This dynamic implies a strategic pivot toward newer products with stronger patent protection and growth potential, while managing the lifecycle of older drugs like Truvada as they near patent expiry.",

      "question": "What does GILD's investment approach in the CART-ddBCMA collaboration suggest about their evolving strategy in cell therapy partnerships compared to other oncology deals in 2023?",
      "answer": "GILD's approach to the CART-ddBCMA collaboration with Arcellx, involving a $313 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses and a $299 million equity investment, suggests a high-commitment, co-development and co-commercialization model that emphasizes shared risk and reward in cell therapy partnerships. This contrasts with other 2023 oncology collaborations, such as the exclusive license agreement with Compugen and the discovery-focused partnership with Tentarix, which likely involved more limited upfront commitments and different risk-sharing structures. The CART-ddBCMA deal also aligns with GILD's broader strategic focus on oncology innovation through partnerships, as noted in the overview section, where they specifically highlighted the Arcellx collaboration as a key transaction in advancing their oncology pipeline.",

The company recognized a $31 million gain from these contracts in fiscal year 2023, which was recorded in 'Other operating expense (income), net.' Additionally, as of the same date, the contracts were designated across different hedging categories, with $9.1 billion in fair value related to cash flow hedges, $7.2 billion to net investment hedges, and $5.8 billion undesignated.

      "question": "How do Medtronic's non-GAAP adjustments related to medical device regulations change as a percentage of income before taxes from fiscal year 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the evolving impact of regulatory costs on earnings?",
      "answer": "Medtronic's non-GAAP adjustments for medical device regulations as a percentage of income before taxes were 1.8% in fiscal 2022 (Medical device regulations: $102 million; Income before income taxes: $5,517 million), 2.8% in fiscal 2023 (Medical device regulations: $150 million; Income before income taxes: $5,364 million), and 2.5% in fiscal 2024 (Medical device regulations: $119 million; Income before income taxes: $4,837 million). This trend indicates that regulatory costs peaked as a proportion of earnings in fiscal 2023 before declining slightly in fiscal 2024, suggesting a temporary intensification of regulatory-related expenses during that period.",

      "question": "How does Danaher's geographic sales distribution for monoclonal antibody-related solutions compare to the overall Biotechnology segment's geographic performance, and what does this imply about regional demand concentration for biotherapeutic manufacturing tools?",
      "answer": "Danaher's Biotechnology segment, which includes solutions supporting monoclonal antibodies, reported 2024 sales by geographic destination as 33% North America, 34% Western Europe, 5% other developed markets, and 28% high-growth markets. This aligns with the broader context that the Biotechnology segment serves a global market with strong representation in developed regions. Meanwhile, the company's overall 2024 sales were distributed as 43% North America, 23% Western Europe, 5% other developed markets, and 29% high-growth markets, indicating that the Biotechnology segment is relatively more weighted toward Western Europe and slightly less toward North America compared to the company-wide average. This suggests a stronger regional demand for monoclonal antibody tools in Western Europe than the company's overall footprint, potentially signaling a strategic focus area for biopharma manufacturing infrastructure.",

BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBusiness-Danaher Corporation ('Danaher' or the 'Company') designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical, research and industrial products and serv ices, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, innov ativ e technology and major market positions. As of December 31, 2024, the Company operates in three business segments:\n\n- The Biotechnology segment includes the bioprocessing and discov ery and medical businesses and offers a broad range of equipment, consumables and services that are primarily used by customers to adv ance and accelerate the research, dev elopment, manufacture and deliv ery of biological medicines. The Company's solutions support a broad range of biotherapeutics including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, replacement therapies such as insulin and v accines, as well as nov el cell, gene, mRNA and other nucleic acid therapies.\n- The Life Sciences segment offers a broad range of instruments, consumables, serv ices and software that are primarily used by customers to study the basic building blocks of life, including DNA and RNA, nucleic acid, proteins, metabolites and cells, in order to understand the causes of disease, identify new therapies, and test and manufacture new drugs, v accines and gene editing technologies. Additionally, the segment prov ides products and consumables used to filter and remov e contaminants from a v ariety of liquids and gases in many end-market applications.\n- The Diagnostics segment offers clinical instruments, consumables, software and serv ices that hospitals, physicians' offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions.\n\nRefer to Notes 2 and 3 for a discussion of acquisitions and discontinued operations, including the disposal of the Company's former Env ironmental &amp; Applied Solutions segment.\n\nAccounting Principles-The accompanying financial statements hav e been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP'). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated upon consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the impact of noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests do not hav e a significant impact on the Company's consolidated results of continuing operations; therefore earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for continuing operations are not presented separately in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests hav e been reflected in selling, general and administrativ e expenses and were insignificant in all periods presented. Reclassifications of certain prior year amounts hav e been made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates-The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience, the current economic env ironment and on various other assumptions that are believ ed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Howev er, uncertainties associated with these estimates exist and actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nCash and Equivalents-The Company considers all highly liquid inv estments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equiv alents.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts-All trade accounts, contract and finance receiv ables are reported on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for any write-offs and net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management's best estimate of the expected future credit losses from the Company's trade accounts, contract and finance receiv able portfolios. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and sev erity of credit losses that could materially affect the prov ision for credit losses and, therefore, net earnings. The Company regularly performs detailed rev iews of its portfolios to determine if an impairment has occurred and ev aluates the collectability of receiv ables based on a combination of v arious financial and qualitativ e factors that may affect customers' ability to pay, including customers' financial condition, collateral, debt-serv icing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserv e is recorded against amounts due to reduce the recognized receiv able to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings and amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances. If any prev iously-written off amounts are subsequently recov ered, the amounts will increase the allowances. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional reserv es would be required. The Company does not believ e that trade accounts receiv able represents significant concentrations of credit risk because",

Through a series of acquisitions and div estitures, Danaher has ev olv ed over time into the science and technology innov ator it is today. While the operating companies that make up Danaher hav e changed, DBS continues to be the guiding philosophy for the Company.\n\nSales in 2024 by geographic destination (geographic destination refers to the geographic area where the final sale to the Company's unaffiliated customer is made) as a percentage of total 2024 sales were: North America, 43% (including 42% in the United States); Western Europe, 23%; other developed markets, 5%; and high-growth markets, 29%. The Company defines North America as the United States and Canada. The Company defines high-growth markets as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America (including Mexico) and Asia (with the exception of Japan, Australia and New Zealand).
