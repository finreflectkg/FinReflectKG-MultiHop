      "question": "How does Philip Morris International's characterization of illicit trade as a systemic risk factor reconcile with the reported decline in illicit trade prevalence in Pakistan, where the company recently incurred $20 million in plant closure costs?",
      "answer": "Philip Morris International identifies illicit trade in tobacco products as a major risk factor that negatively impacts its business, volume, results of operations, and financial position (Page 40). However, in South & Southeast Asia, including Pakistan, the company notes a 17.3% market increase driven partly by a lower prevalence of illicit trade during the pandemic (Page 58). Despite this favorable trend, the company recorded $20 million in asset impairment and exit costs related to a cigarette plant closure in Pakistan (Page 126), suggesting that market dynamics, even with reduced illicit trade, did not justify continued local production. This indicates a complex interplay between risk mitigation and operational restructuring in response to evolving market conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "Net earnings attributable to PMI of $9.1 billion increased by $1.1 billion or 13.1%. This increase was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Basic and diluted EPS of $5.83 increased by 13.0%. Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

These futures are part of a broader risk management strategy that also includes Level 2 instruments and are managed through counterparties with investment-grade ratings to mitigate credit risk.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Any unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market impacts)",

      "answer": "MDLZ categorizes its net investment hedge contracts under Level 2 financial assets, which are valued using observable market inputs such as forward rates and commodity index prices. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of these contracts was reported at $71 million. This valuation aligns with the Level 2 methodology, which relies on income-based approaches using observable inputs rather than direct market prices or unobservable assumptions. The $71 million figure reflects the application of these valuation techniques, specifically tailored for over-the-counter derivatives without active quoted market prices, thus ensuring consistency between the disclosed fair value and the valuation methodology described for Level 2 financial assets.",

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off.

This acquisition brought the ZYN brand, a leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S., into PM's portfolio, aligning with the company's broader strategy to transition toward reduced-risk products. The inclusion of ZYN within PM's smoke-free product segment underscores the importance of oral nicotine delivery systems in PM's long-term vision, supported by the financial backing evident in the debt structure.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's Beverages segment accounts for 23% of total net revenue in the APAC region in 2024, indicating a significant but minority share compared to Convenient Foods. Meanwhile, the company reported $10 million in capital expenditures for APAC in 2024, which is relatively low compared to other regions like Europe ($123 million) and LatAm ($51 million). This suggests that while the Beverages business is a consistent contributor in APAC, the company's capital investment in the region remains modest, potentially signaling restrained growth expectations or strategic prioritization elsewhere.",

      "answer": "MDLZ utilizes commodity futures to hedge against price risks associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials such as cocoa, sugar, and wheat (page 94). These commodity futures are classified as Level 1 financial assets (page 112), indicating they are exchange-traded instruments valued using quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. The valuation methodology for Level 1 assets reflects transparency and liquidity, aligning with MDLZ's strategy of using non-speculative, risk-mitigating instruments. This classification and valuation approach reveals that MDLZ prioritizes instruments with observable market pricing to manage commodity exposure in a manner consistent with their stated risk management policies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Any unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market impacts)",

Specifically, the fair value of these contracts is derived from an income approach based on observable market factors, aligning with the broader Level 2 valuation methodology. On page 111, the company discloses that the fair value of net investment hedge contracts was $71 million as of December 31, 2021, and this entire amount falls under Level 2 inputs, confirming that no Level 1 or Level 3 valuations are involved. This synthesis reveals that MDLZ relies on market-observable models for these contracts and transparently reports their fair value within the appropriate hierarchy level.",

      "answer": "Altria Group, Inc. (MO) depends on PM USA as a guarantor for its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and other debt obligations, with PM USA providing unconditional guarantees that are not limited by contingent liabilities. However, under the Distribution Agreement following the 2008 spin-off of PMI, indemnification for tobacco-related liabilities between PM USA and PMI is conditional and based on manufacturing responsibility\u2014PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA only for liabilities related to products it manufactured or had contract manufactured, and vice versa. This creates a potential misalignment: PM USA guarantees Altria\u2019s full debt obligations without limitation, yet its indemnification exposure to Altria is restricted to only those liabilities tied to its own manufacturing, which could expose PM USA to disproportionate financial risk relative to the indemnification protections it receives.",

The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "answer": "Altria's liquidity risk is heightened by PM USA's legal exposure, which includes over $896 million in cumulative payments for adverse tobacco-related litigation judgments and settlements as of December 31, 2021. To maintain appeal stays, PM USA has posted $50 million in appeal bonds backed by restricted cash, directly impacting Altria's liquidity by tying up capital that could otherwise be used for operations or debt servicing. Furthermore, PM USA fully and unconditionally guarantees Altria's debt obligations, meaning that if Altria defaults, PM USA must fulfill these liabilities. However, if PM USA itself becomes insolvent or is unable to meet its own obligations due to litigation costs, the guarantees could be voided under fraudulent conveyance laws, leaving Altria's creditors exposed. This dual exposure\u2014through both litigation risk and structural guarantees\u2014creates a complex liquidity risk profile where Altria's financial health is tightly linked to PM USA's legal and financial stability.",

Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations.

      "answer": "Altria depends on PM USA to fully and unconditionally guarantee its obligations under $3.0 billion in debt instruments, as outlined in the Guarantees section. However, under the Distribution Agreement with PMI, indemnification for tobacco-related liabilities is not unconditional\u2014PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA only for liabilities tied to products it manufactured or had contract manufactured, while PM USA indemnifies PMI only for liabilities from products it manufactured, excluding those made for PMI. This creates a structural asymmetry: PM USA\u2019s guarantee to Altria is absolute and not contingent on the nature of the liability, yet its indemnification from PMI is conditional and limited to specific manufacturing scenarios. This could expose Altria to risk if PM USA incurs liabilities outside the scope of its indemnification from PMI, particularly those not tied to tobacco product manufacturing.",

        "Hop 3: [PMI] \u2190 [MO](page_108): MO (Altria) does not record a liability for this indemnification because its fair value is deemed insignificant, despite the conditional nature of the indemnification framework."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "answer": "Philip Morris International notes in its regulatory section that Vietnam is among the countries where voluntary standards for heat-not-burn products have been adopted, indicating a potential openness to novel tobacco products. However, in the South & Southeast Asia market commentary, the company attributes a 10.0% market increase in Vietnam to a lower prevalence of illicit trade, which was partly due to pandemic-related supply disruptions. This aligns with the broader risk factor on page 40, where illicit trade is cited as a material challenge affecting volume, results of operations, and competitiveness. The alignment suggests that while Vietnam's regulatory stance on novel products remains non-mandatory, the temporary reduction in illicit trade during the pandemic provided a short-term boost to PMI's market position, highlighting the dual importance of both regulatory engagement and illicit trade mitigation in shaping long-term profitability in the region.",

          "chunk_text": "FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\n\nOn  September  29,  2021,  the  International  Trade  Commission  (\"ITC\")  issued  its  Final  Determination  (\"FD\"),  Limited  Exclusion  Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\"). The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the ID and found a subsequent violation. The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021. We have appealed the patent issues. Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office. The decision has no bearing outside the United States.\n\nUntil  recently,  there  were  no  countries  with  specific  product  standards  for  heat-not-burn  products.  Currently,  national  standards  setting minimum  quality  and  safety  requirements  for  such  products  have  been  adopted  in  several  countries  with  technical  heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam, the  U.K.  and  Ukraine.  In  Japan,  a  voluntary  standard  sets  minimum  safety  requirements  for  tobacco  heating  devices.  We  expect  other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated  tobacco  units,  and  e-cigarettes.  Most  of  the  EU  member  states  require  a  notification  submitted  six  months  before  the  intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\n\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for HEETS , used with the IQOS device, requesting regulatory recognition of the  reduction  of  toxic  substances  and  potential  risk  reduction  resulting  from  switching  to  this  product  compared  to  continued  cigarette smoking. In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited ('PML'), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia ('TGA') seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\n\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\n\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two  heat-not-burn  products,  one  of  which  was  our  Platform  1  product.  The  assessment  concluded  that,  while  still  harmful  to  health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ('BfR') published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%. This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment ('RIVM') published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product. RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

These guarantees expose PM USA to significant financial liability, which could be affected by its solvency and asset position. Separately, PM USA has posted $50 million in appeal bonds, collateralized with restricted cash, to secure stays of adverse tobacco-related litigation judgments pending appeal. The solvency and asset considerations relevant to the enforceability of the guarantees under fraudulent conveyance laws are directly tied to PM USA\u2019s ability to meet its obligations, including those arising from litigation-related deposits.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

(1)\n\nThe accrued liability for tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, including related interest costs, was included in accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. Pre-tax charges for tobacco and health and certain other litigation were included in marketing, administration and research costs on Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses). Pre-tax charges for related interest costs were included in interest and other debt expense, net on Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\nAfter exhausting all appeals in those cases resulting in adverse verdicts associated with tobacco-related litigation, since October 2004, PM USA has paid judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) totaling approximately $896 million and interest totaling approximately $227 million as of December 31, 2021. These amounts include payments for Engle progeny judgments (and related costs and fees) totaling approximately $410 million and related interest totaling approximately $56 million.\n\nSecurity for Judgments: To obtain stays of judgments pending appeal, PM USA has posted various forms of security. As of December 31, 2021, PM USA has posted appeal bonds totaling approximately $50 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that are included in assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Overview of Altria and/or PM USA Tobacco-Related Litigation\n\nTypes and Number of U.S. Cases: Claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories: (i) smoking and health cases alleging personal injury brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs; (ii) health care cost recovery cases brought by governmental (both domestic and foreign) plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking and/or disgorgement of profits; (iii) e-vapor cases alleging violation of RICO, fraud, failure to warn, design defect, negligence, antitrust and unfair trade practices; and (iv) other tobacco-related litigation described below.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nSte. Michelle Transaction - On October 1, 2021, UST received net cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion from the Ste. Michelle Transaction, which was used to partially fund the expansion of the January 2021 share repurchase program as discussed in Note 10. Capital Stock to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 10').\n\nIn October 2020, Altria filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which Altria may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nAltria has no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 18, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2021. From time to time, subsidiaries of Altria also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 9, PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, Altria makes interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 9.\n\nPurchase Obligations - Altria has entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2021, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $827 million and $1,274 million thereafter (a decrease from $1,095 million and $2,902 million at December 31, 2020, respectively, driven primarily by the Ste. Michelle Transaction).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria had $609 million of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. Substantially all of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on Altria's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 18, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states and territories of the United States that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 18.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that Altria's subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $4.4 billion on average for the next three years. These amounts exclude the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. Altria's subsidiaries paid approximately $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2021, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $50 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAlthough litigation is subject to uncertainty and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of PM USA, UST or Altria in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 18, Item 3 and Item 1A, management expects cash flow from operations, together with Altria's access to capital markets, to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs.\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities - Altria had $1.5 billion of accrued postretirement health care costs on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and estimates approximately $100 million of annual payments. In addition, Altria has accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets. For further information on Altria's postretirement health care and pension",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's U.S. plan assets include $411 million in real estate commingled funds as of 2023, which are valued using unobservable inputs such as appraisals from independent third parties and are redeemable quarterly subject to liquidity. These funds are part of a broader U.S. plan asset base totaling $11,724 million, which is managed under an investment strategy aiming for a long-term return of 7.4%. The company's strategy emphasizes diversification across equity, high-quality debt, and real estate, suggesting that the inclusion of real estate commingled funds supports this diversified approach.

      "answer": "The adoption timeline of ASU 2022-04, which required initial implementation of disclosure requirements beginning January 1, 2023, and roll-forward disclosures starting January 1, 2024, directly impacts the completeness of the Supplier Finance Program obligations disclosed in the financial statements. As a result, Colgate's 2024 financial statements include both the initial disclosures and the roll-forward information, enhancing transparency and detail around the confirmed amount outstanding and related balance sheet presentation for the supplier finance obligations. This phased adoption is reflected in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which provides a comprehensive view of the program's impact for the reporting period.",

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

      "answer": "Altria's strategic emphasis on Horizon, a joint venture with JTIUH for the U.S. commercialization of heated tobacco stick (HTS) products, is a core component of its broader Vision to transition adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives. However, the risk factors section underscores that Horizon's success is heavily dependent on obtaining regulatory authorizations, such as FDA approvals, which are also critical for other innovative products like NJOY. The failure to secure or maintain these authorizations could significantly hinder Horizon's ability to generate new revenue streams and expand into new markets, thereby threatening Altria's Vision and its strategic pivot toward smoke-free alternatives.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, beverages contributed 23% of PepsiCo's net revenue in the APAC region, as shown in the regional net revenue breakdown. However, the company disclosed $0 in acquisition and divestiture-related charges specifically for the APAC region during the same fiscal year. This indicates that despite a notable portion of revenue coming from beverages in APAC, PepsiCo did not engage in any significant M&A activity in the region during 2023, suggesting a period of operational stability rather than expansion through acquisitions in that geography.",

      "answer": "Altria's 2023 capital expenditure allocation shows $59 million invested in oral tobacco products versus $77 million in smokeable products, indicating a relatively balanced investment approach between the two segments. This suggests that despite the larger revenue base and market dominance of smokeable products, Altria is continuing to support its oral tobacco segment, which includes leading brands like Copenhagen and Skoal. The corporate structure supports this approach through its wholly owned subsidiaries, with USSTC managing the oral tobacco product line and PM USA overseeing smokeable products. This clear segmentation allows Altria to strategically allocate capital based on market conditions, regulatory environment, and consumer trends affecting each product category independently.",

      "answer": "Altria's acquisition of NJOY for $2.9 billion demonstrates a strategic commitment to expanding its portfolio of reduced-risk products, directly supporting its 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision. NJOY, as the only e-vapor manufacturer with FDA-authorized pod-based e-vapor products, provides Altria with a credible and regulated pathway to transition adult smokers away from combustible products. This aligns with Altria's broader positioning in its business description (page 4) that emphasizes leading the transition to a smoke-free future. The acquisition, detailed in the financial statements (page 60), reflects a significant investment in e-vapor innovation and regulatory compliance, reinforcing the company\u2019s strategic narrative of responsible leadership in tobacco harm reduction.",

      "answer": "The VEBA trust, which funds one of Coca-Cola's U.S. postretirement benefit plans, holds primarily liquid assets to meet the expected level and timing of future benefit payments (page 103). This liquidity-focused strategy aligns with the defined-dollar structure of the plans, which limit the company's exposure to rising health care costs by setting fixed contribution levels (page 105). The alignment suggests a risk-mitigated approach where asset liquidity ensures timely payment of fixed-dollar benefits without requiring significant portfolio restructuring in response to inflationary pressures.",

      "answer": "The FSPTCA's advertising restrictions, such as the prohibition on brand-sponsored events and distribution of promotional items like branded apparel, limit Altria's ability to differentiate premium brands in the marketplace. This limitation is compounded by private sector activity referenced on page 42, where national retailers and digital platforms have restricted tobacco product communications. These combined constraints reduce premium brand marketing effectiveness at a time when page 39 shows Altria faces increased compliance costs under FSPTCA's manufacturing practice requirements, which could constrain investment in brand differentiation strategies. This creates a scenario where consumers may be more price-sensitive with fewer compelling brand narratives available, contributing to the 0.6 share point sequential increase in discount brand performance observed on page 35.",

The proposed rule is subject to the Trump Administration's January 2025 executive order pausing all federal agency rulemaking for 60 days. Following the 60-day pause, the proposed product standard, if not withdrawn, may proceed through the rulemaking process, including the solicitation of public comment, which we believe would take multiple years to complete.\n- Flavors in Tobacco Products : In April 2022, the FDA issued two proposed product standards: (i) banning menthol in cigarettes and (ii) banning all characterizing flavors (including menthol) in cigars. We submitted comments during the notice-and-comment period. In October 2023, the FDA submitted the two proposed product standards to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. In April 2024, the FDA announced the indefinite delay of a decision on the menthol ban, citing the high volume of feedback received during the notice-and-comment period. In January 2025, the Trump Administration withdrew the two proposed product standards from the Office of Management and Budget ('OMB') and sent them back to the FDA.\n- N-nitrosonornicotine ('NNN') in Smokeless Tobacco : In January 2017, the FDA proposed a product standard for NNN levels in finished smokeless tobacco products.\n\nIf any one or more of the foregoing potential product standards were to become final and was appealed and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, including a material adverse effect on the carrying value of certain of our assets such as our cigar trademarks.\n\n- Tobacco Product Manufacturing Practices: In March 2023, the FDA, pursuant to the requirements of the FSPTCA, issued a proposed rule setting forth requirements for tobacco product manufacturers regarding the manufacture, design, packing and storage of their products. This proposed rule establishes a framework of tobacco product manufacturing practices, including by:\n- establishing tobacco product design and development controls;\n- ensuring that finished and bulk tobacco products are manufactured according to established specifications;\n- minimizing the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products that do not meet specifications;\n- requiring manufacturers to take appropriate measures to prevent contamination of tobacco products;\n- requiring investigation and identification of products that do not meet specifications and requiring manufacturers to institute appropriate corrective actions, such as a recall; and\n- establishing the ability to trace all components or parts, ingredients, additives and materials, as well as each batch of finished or bulk tobacco products, to aid in investigations of those that do not meet specifications.\n\nWe engaged with the FDA through the rulemaking process, including during the notice-and-comment period, which closed in October 2023. OMB currently lists the rule as a long-term action. If the proposed rule were to take effect, our operating companies could experience increased costs to comply with the rule.\n\n- Impact on Our Business; Compliance Costs and User Fees: Additional FDA regulatory actions under the FSPTCA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position in various ways. For ex ample, actions (or inaction) by the FDA could:\n- impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products;\n- discontinue, delay or prevent the sale or distribution of ex isting, new or modified tobacco products;\n- limit adult tobacco consumer choices;\n- impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers;\n- create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies;\n- impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements;\n- impose additional restrictions at retail;\n- result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products; and\n- otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.\n\nThe FSPTCA imposes user fees on cigarette, cigarette tobacco, smokeless tobacco, cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters. The FSPTCA does not impose user fees on e-vapor products or oral nicotine pouch manufacturers. The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations. Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below for a discussion of our FDA user fee payments. In addition, our operating companies' compliance with the FSPTCA's regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year-to-date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate.

For the fourth quarter of 2024, the discount share of the cigarette category reached 30.4%, an increase of 0.6 share points sequentially and an increase of 1.7 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe continue to monitor the evolving regulatory, macroeconomic and consumer dynamics within our business environment for impacts on our businesses. Changes in these and other conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## FSPTCA and FDA Regulation\n\n- The Regulatory Framework: The FSPTCA and its related regulations establish broad FDA regulatory authority over all tobacco products and, among other provisions:\n- impose restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products (see Final Tobacco Marketing Rule below);\n- establish pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products (see Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below);\n- prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;\n- authorize the FDA to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (see Potential Product Standards below); and\n- equip the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities (see Investigation and Enforcement below).\n\nThe FSPTCA also bans descriptors such as 'light,' 'low' or 'mild' when used as descriptors of modified risk, unless expressly authorized by the FDA.\n\nEffective April 2022, the U.S. Congress expanded the statutory definition of tobacco products to include products containing nicotine derived from any source, including synthetic nicotine. See Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below for additional information on the effects of the statutory change. Currently, however, the statutory definition of tobacco products does not cover products containing nicotine analogues, which are designed to imitate the effects of nicotine. As a result, products containing nicotine analogues are not subject to the FDA regulatory framework for tobacco products, including the requirements that manufacturers submit a PMTA to, and receive an MGO from, the FDA before marketing such products in the United States.\n\n- Final Tobacco Marketing Rule: As required by the FSPTCA, in March 2010, the FDA promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products (the 'Final Tobacco Marketing Rule'). The May 2016 deeming regulations amended the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule to expand specific provisions to all tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco and e-vapor and oral nicotine products containing tobacco-derived nicotine or other tobacco derivatives. (1)\n\nThe Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, as amended, among other things:\n\n- restricts the use of non-tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products;\n- prohibits sampling of all tobacco products except that sampling of smokeless tobacco products is permitted in qualified adult-only facilities;\n- prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos;\n- prohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical, artistic or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event; and\n- requires the development by the FDA of graphic warnings for cigarettes, establishes warning requirements for other tobacco products and gives the FDA the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco product (see FDA Regulatory Actions - Graphic Warnings below).\n\nSubject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule took effect in June 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products containing tobacco-derived nicotine, and in April 2022 for tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products, that contain nicotine from any source other than tobacco, such as synthetic nicotine. The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule currently does not apply to products containing nicotine analogues.\n\n- Rulemaking and Guidance: From time to time, the FDA issues proposed regulations and guidance, which may be issued in draft or final form, that generally involve public comment and may include scientific review. The FDA also may request comments on\n\n'Smokeless tobacco,' as used in this section of this Form 10-K, refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the FDA in 2009, including MST. It excludes oral nicotine pouches, which were first regulated by the FDA in 2016. (1)",

Scientific determinations as to any health risks or negative health consequences associated with the use of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco products businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For ex ample, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; impose responsibility on manufacturers for the disposal, recycling or other treatment of post-consumer goods such as plastic packaging; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful. In addition, if a pandemic or similar health emergency occurs, state and local governments may reimpose additional health and safety requirements for all businesses, which could result in the potential temporary closure of certain businesses and facilities. It is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. Any such legislation, regulation or other governmental action could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. For example, we currently are, or recently have been, subject to a number of governmental investigations with respect to our former investment in JUUL, which we divested in March 2023, including the following: (i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') issued a Civil Investigative Demand to us while conducting its antitrust review of our former investment in JUUL; (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to our acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to us seeking documents relating to our former investment in and provision of services to JUUL. For a discussion of our disposition of our former investment in JUUL, see Note 8.\n\nIn April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the lawsuits relating to our former investment in JUUL initiated by the attorneys general of Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico, respectively.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on Tobacco Products\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of all tobacco products, and others have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products. Reasons for the discontinuation include change in corporate policy and, with respect to e-vapor products, reported illnesses and the uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, third-party digital platforms, such as app stores, have restricted, and in some cases prohibited, communications with adult tobacco consumers concerning tobacco products. It is possible that if this private sector activity becomes more widespread it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit disposable e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products may be designed to appeal to youth and are manufactured without scientific standards, exposing consumers to undocumented risks. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing",

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "question": "How do the marketing restrictions imposed on USSTC under the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement affect Altria's revenue recognition policies for product returns, particularly given USSTC's unique acceptance of returns for products past freshness dates?",
      "answer": "The marketing restrictions under the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (STMSA) imposed on USSTC limit its ability to promote and distribute new or flavored smokeless tobacco products, potentially reducing market responsiveness to new offerings. This regulatory constraint indirectly affects Altria's revenue recognition policies, as USSTC maintains a policy of accepting returns for products past freshness dates due to the short shelf life of its MST and snus products. As a result, Altria must estimate and account for sales returns as a reduction to revenues, based on historical return rates. These return estimates are critical to accurately reflecting revenue in the period of sale and are unique to USSTC among Altria's tobacco subsidiaries, highlighting how regulatory constraints influence financial reporting practices.",

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Note 3. Revenues from Contracts with Customers\n\nAltria disaggregates net revenues based on product type. For further discussion, see Note 15. Segment Reporting .\n\nIn 2020, a majority of Altria's businesses offered cash discounts to customers for prompt payment and calculated cash discounts as a percentage of the list price based on historical experience and agreed-upon payment terms. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 for USSTC and in the third quarter of 2021 for PM USA, cash discounts were calculated as a flat rate per unit, based on agreed-upon payment terms. Altria's businesses record receivables net of the cash discounts on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAltria's businesses that receive payments in advance of product shipment record such payments as deferred revenue. These payments are included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until control of such products is obtained by the customer. Deferred revenue was $287 million and $301 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. When cash is received in advance of product shipment, Altria's businesses satisfy their performance obligations within three days of receiving payment. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no differences between amounts recorded as deferred revenue and amounts subsequently recognized as revenue.\n\nReceivables were $47 million and $137 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; the decrease was due primarily to the Ste. Michelle Transaction. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no expected differences between amounts recorded and subsequently received, and Altria's businesses did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables.\n\nAltria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. While all of Altria's tobacco operating companies sell tobacco products with dates relative to freshness as printed on product packaging, it is USSTC's policy to accept authorized sales returns from its customers for products that have passed such dates due to the limited shelf life of USSTC's MST and snus products. Altria's businesses record estimated sales returns, which are based principally on historical volume and return rates, as a reduction to revenues. Actual sales returns will differ from estimated sales returns to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Altria's businesses reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements. All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory. Consequently, Altria's businesses do not record an asset for their right to recover goods from customers upon return.\n\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by Altria's businesses. Altria's businesses include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers. The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\n- Price promotion paymentsAltria's businesses make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to their retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n- Wholesale and retail participation paymentsAltria's businesses make payments to their wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with each business's trade agreements.\n\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates. Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, 'Business Combinations-Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.' This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

      "answer": "The beverage revenues in the AMEA region grew from $546 million in 2019 to an implied $646.5 million in 2021 (based on 1.9% of $33,883 million total net revenues in 2021), representing a 15.5% increase. Meanwhile, the AMEA segment's operating income grew more significantly, rising from $691 million in 2019 to $1,054 million in 2021, a 52.6% increase. This suggests that while beverage revenue growth contributed to the region's performance, the AMEA segment's profitability improved at a faster rate, potentially indicating stronger margin expansion or cost control in the region beyond just beverage sales.",

      "question": "How does MDLZ's reliance on Gum & Candy sales in the AMEA region compare to the region's overall profitability, and what does this suggest about how MDLZ strategically positions confectionery within the AMEA market?",
      "answer": "MDLZ generated $861 million in Gum & Candy revenue in the AMEA region in 2021, representing 2.8% of the company\u2019s total net revenues from that category. Meanwhile, the AMEA region as a whole contributed $6,465 million in total net revenues in 2021 and delivered $1,054 million in operating income, indicating strong regional profitability. Given that Gum & Candy is a smaller portion of both the region\u2019s and the company\u2019s total revenue mix, yet the AMEA region remains a significant contributor to overall earnings, it suggests that MDLZ may strategically position confectionery as a complementary product line within AMEA, supporting broader brand presence and regional growth rather than serving as the primary profit driver.",

      "answer": "The $883 million cash outflow for the final redemption of Swedish Match shares (page_92) represents a significant financial commitment to securing full ownership of Swedish Match, which includes the ZYN brand. This acquisition is a strategic move to strengthen PM's smoke-free product portfolio, as ZYN is positioned as a leading nicotine pouch brand in 37 markets (page_5). The acquisition accelerates PM's transformation into a smoke-free company by integrating ZYN's market presence and product leadership in oral nicotine delivery with PM's existing global infrastructure and distribution capabilities. The financial investment underscores PM's commitment to expanding ZYN's footprint and leveraging its position as a key component of the company's broader smoke-free strategy, as highlighted in the business overview (page_4).",

          "chunk_text": "In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act, PMI subsequently exercised its right to initiate arbitral proceedings to compulsorily redeem the remaining shares for which acceptances were not received and obtained legal title to 100% of the shares in Swedish Match on February 17, 2023. Cash paid in connection with such legal title, together with an immaterial amount attributable to open market purchases that were executed in December 2022 but settled in January 2023, amounted to $883 million and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. While PMI paid the referenced amounts and acquired legal title to the shares, under the Swedish Companies Act the redemption process was not complete until the final redemption price was determined by an arbitral tribunal. On September 12, 2023, the arbitral tribunal determined the final redemption price to be Swedish krona (SEK) 115.07, unchanged from the SEK 115.07 that PMI paid per share in connection with obtaining legal title to the shares. This process was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 when the opportunity to appeal the arbitral tribunal determination ended.\n\nSwedish  Match  is  a  market  leader  in  oral  nicotine  delivery  with  a  significant  presence  in  the  United  States  market.  The  acquisition  is  accelerating  PMI's transformation to become a smoke-free company with a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine.\n\nIn November 2023, PMI finalized all measurement period adjustments related to the Swedish Match acquisition.

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business.\n\n## General Development of Business\n\n## General\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a V irginia holding company incorporated in 1987. In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as postmarket studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies' IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match's General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI's IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. V ersions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI's transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product. By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\n\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled  prescription  products  for  therapy  areas  that  include  pain  management  and  cardiovascular  emergencies.  This  includes  medical  and  pharmaceutical cannabinoids,  and  non-recreational  cannabinoid  products  (including  CBD),  in  line  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  though  any  revenue  related  to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTUs\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our BLENDS , DELIA , HEETS , HEETS Creations (defined collectively as \" HEETS \"), SENTIA , TEREA, TEREA CRAFTED and TEREA Dimensions, as well\n\n## PART I",

IQOS was  first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014.\n\nIQOS and ZYN are the leading brands in our SFPs portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets. With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&amp;M , and Philip Morris. These five international cigarette brands contributed 80% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2024. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji  Sam  Soe and Sampoerna  A in  Indonesia,  and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, ex cept to the ex tent that claims of  our  company  itself  as  a  creditor  may  be  recognized. As  a  holding  company,  our  principal  sources  of  funds,  including  funds  to  make  payment  on  our  debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n\n## Description of Business\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023. Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 3.7% in 2024.\n\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China. Past reported periods may be updated to ensure comparability and to incorporate the most current information for industry and market share reporting.",

      "answer": "PM USA's unconditional guarantee of MO's commercial paper program provides assurance to creditors regarding MO's obligations, but MO's liquidity planning must still consider its holding company structure. As a holding company, MO relies on dividends and intercompany loan interest from subsidiaries like PM USA for operating cash flows. The guarantee ensures access to short-term financing, but MO's financial flexibility depends on the operating performance and distributions from its subsidiaries. This is highlighted by MO's recent $1.0 billion debt issuance and $2.8 billion in 2023 payments related to the IQOS agreement, which would require sufficient liquidity from subsidiary distributions to service.",

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

      "answer": "PEP recognized a $122 million pre-tax gain from remeasuring its previously held 50% equity stake in Sabra to fair value upon acquiring the remaining 50% ownership interest in Sabra Dipping Company, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. This acquisition aligns with Frito-Lay North America's (FLNA) strategic focus on branded dips, as Sabra Dipping Company now contributes its refrigerated dips and spreads directly to FLNA\u2019s broader portfolio of convenient foods.

      "question": "How does PepsiCo's acquisition of full ownership in Sabra Dipping Company align with the strategic importance of the Sabra brand in expanding refrigerated dips and spreads within FLNA, and what financial impact did this have on the division in 2024?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's acquisition of the remaining 50% of Sabra Dipping Company for $241 million in December 2024 aligns with the strategic importance of the Sabra brand, which is central to expanding its refrigerated dips and spreads portfolio under Frito-Lay North America (FLNA). This acquisition made Sabra a wholly-owned subsidiary, enabling full integration and control over a key product line. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $122 million ($92 million after-tax or $0.07 per share) recognized in FLNA, recorded under selling, general and administrative expenses, due to the re-measurement of the previously held 50% equity stake at fair value. This financial impact underscores the strategic and economic significance of the Sabra brand in PepsiCo's broader portfolio expansion strategy.",

Upon consolidation, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $122 m illion ($92 m illion after-tax or $0.07 per share) in our FLNA division, recorded in selling, general and adm inistrative expenses, related to the rem easurem ent of our previously held  50% equity ownership in Sabra at fair value using a com bination of the transaction price, net of a control prem ium , and discounted cash flows.\n\nWe accounted for the acquisition as a business com bination in the fourth quarter of 2024. W e recognized and m easured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assum ed at their estim ated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our FLNA division.

We expect to f i nal i z e th ese am ounts as soon as possi bl e, but no l ater than the f ourth quarter of 2025.\n\n## Acquisition of Siete\n\nOn January 17, 2025, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interest in Siete, a Mexican-Am erican foods business, in a transaction valued at approximately $1.2 billion.

      "question": "How does PEP's acquisition of Be & Cheery in the APAC region relate to the declining proportion of beverage revenue in that region between 2019 and 2021?",
      "answer": "PEP acquired Be & Cheery in the APAC region in 2019, as noted in the transaction table where the company reported a $4 million investment in that year. During the same period, the proportion of beverage revenue in APAC declined from 25% in 2020 to 20% in 2021, as detailed in the regional revenue breakdown by category. This suggests that while PEP expanded its beverage portfolio in APAC through the acquisition, the broader regional business mix shifted toward convenient food or other categories, potentially diluting the relative contribution of beverages to overall revenue. The acquisition appears to have been a strategic move to strengthen PEP's beverage presence in APAC, even as the segment's proportional performance weakened.",

These contracts are categorized as Level 2 financial liabilities, which are valued using an income approach based on observable market inputs. Specifically, for net investment hedge contracts, MDLZ applies methodologies such as discounted cash flow analysis or market forward rates, as detailed in the valuation methods section. This approach aligns with the company\u2019s treatment of other Level 2 liabilities, which rely on observable inputs such as forward rates, commodity prices, and interest rate curves, adjusted for nonperformance risk and counterparty credit risk. The $71 million figure is therefore consistent with the broader framework for Level 2 liabilities, which are not based on directly quoted market prices (Level 1) but instead derived from structured valuation models using observable data.",

      "question": "How does Altria's indemnification arrangement with PMI for tobacco-related liabilities interact with PM USA's unconditional guarantees of Altria's debt obligations, particularly in light of the potential insolvency risks outlined in the supplemental guarantor financial information?",
      "answer": "Altria has no recorded liability for PMI's indemnification obligations because their fair value is deemed insignificant. However, PM USA, a 100% owned subsidiary, has issued unconditional guarantees covering Altria\u2019s obligations under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement, commercial paper program, and outstanding debt securities. The supplemental guarantor financial information warns that if PM USA becomes insolvent\u2014defined as having debts exceeding assets or being unable to pay obligations as they mature\u2014the guarantees could be voided or subordinated under federal bankruptcy or state fraudulent transfer laws. This creates a potential risk chain: while PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA for liabilities tied to PMI-manufactured tobacco products, PM USA's financial health directly affects Altria\u2019s ability to meet its debt obligations, and any insolvency event could expose Altria to unsecured creditor status.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MO](page_108) \u2192 [PMI]: Altria references the Distribution Agreement with PMI, under which PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products it manufactures or has contract-manufactured by PM USA.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets. With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&amp;M , and Philip Morris.

Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023.

In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as postmarket studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies' IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match's General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI's IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. V ersions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI's transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product. By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\n\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled  prescription  products  for  therapy  areas  that  include  pain  management  and  cardiovascular  emergencies.  This  includes  medical  and  pharmaceutical cannabinoids,  and  non-recreational  cannabinoid  products  (including  CBD),  in  line  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  though  any  revenue  related  to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTUs\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our BLENDS , DELIA , HEETS , HEETS Creations (defined collectively as \" HEETS \"), SENTIA , TEREA, TEREA CRAFTED and TEREA Dimensions, as well\n\n## PART I",

          "chunk_text": "In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act, PMI subsequently exercised its right to initiate arbitral proceedings to compulsorily redeem the remaining shares for which acceptances were not received and obtained legal title to 100% of the shares in Swedish Match on February 17, 2023. Cash paid in connection with such legal title, together with an immaterial amount attributable to open market purchases that were executed in December 2022 but settled in January 2023, amounted to $883 million and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. While PMI paid the referenced amounts and acquired legal title to the shares, under the Swedish Companies Act the redemption process was not complete until the final redemption price was determined by an arbitral tribunal. On September 12, 2023, the arbitral tribunal determined the final redemption price to be Swedish krona (SEK) 115.07, unchanged from the SEK 115.07 that PMI paid per share in connection with obtaining legal title to the shares. This process was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 when the opportunity to appeal the arbitral tribunal determination ended.\n\nSwedish  Match  is  a  market  leader  in  oral  nicotine  delivery  with  a  significant  presence  in  the  United  States  market.  The  acquisition  is  accelerating  PMI's transformation to become a smoke-free company with a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine.\n\nIn November 2023, PMI finalized all measurement period adjustments related to the Swedish Match acquisition.

      "question": "How does the strategic importance of Horizon Innovations LLC, as a joint venture for HTS product commercialization, align with Altria's exposure to macroeconomic and business conditions that could impede its Vision of transitioning adult smokers to smoke-free products?",
      "answer": "Altria's joint venture Horizon Innovations LLC, in which PM USA holds a 75% economic interest, is central to its strategy for commercializing heated tobacco stick (HTS) products in the U.S., a key component of its Vision to transition adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives. However, the success of Horizon is highly dependent on external factors such as regulatory authorizations, economic conditions, market dynamics, and adult consumer preferences\u2014all of which are categorized as macro business conditions that could materially affect Horizon\u2019s ability to generate revenue. These macro risks are explicitly outlined in Altria\u2019s risk factors, where changes in economic conditions, regulatory environments, or consumer behavior could delay product development, disrupt test launches, or prevent the joint venture from achieving its commercialization goals. This creates a tension between the strategic intent behind Horizon\u2019s formation and the external forces that could hinder its execution, directly impacting Altria\u2019s broader Vision and financial outcomes.",

        "Hop 1: [MO](page page_4) \u2192 [Horizon]: Altria formed Horizon Innovations LLC as a joint venture with JTIUH to commercialize HTS products, with PM USA holding a 75% economic interest and governance control.",
        "Hop 2: [Horizon] \u2192 [Business Conditions]: The success of Horizon is contingent on factors like regulatory approvals, economic conditions, and consumer preferences, which are macro-level risks that could impede its commercialization efforts.",
        "Hop 3: [Business Conditions] \u2190 [MO](page page_10): Altria acknowledges in its risk factors that macroeconomic conditions\u2014including inflation, trade disruptions, and regulatory changes\u2014could significantly impact its business, including the ability to commercialize new products like those from Horizon."

      "answer": "PM reported a significant 8.2% total market growth in Turkey, with increased in-bound tourism (particularly by Turkish expatriates) being a key driver of adult smoker consumption. In this context, PM achieved a strong 18.3% net revenue growth (excluding currency and acquisitions), partly driven by higher cigarette volumes in Turkey. In contrast, in Mexico, PM noted a more modest 4.2% total market growth linked to increased in-bound tourism, with PM's shipment volume growing by 4.7% and market share remaining stable at 33.4%. This comparison highlights that while both markets benefited from tourism-related demand, Turkey's market dynamics and PM's revenue performance were stronger, despite higher illicit trade prevalence in Turkey.",

        "Hop 2: Turkey \u2192 Increased In-Bound Tourism: Turkey's market grew 8.2%, with PM specifically attributing this to the easing of pandemic restrictions and increased in-bound tourism, particularly by Turkish expatriates.",

Excluding  the  unfavorable  impact  of  the  Saudi  Arabia  customs  assessments, unfavorable  currency  and  acquisitions,  net  revenues  increased  by  18.3%,  reflecting:  favorable  volume/mix,  primarily  driven  by  higher cigarette volume (predominantly in PMI Duty Free and Turkey, partly offset by the GCC and North Africa), higher heated tobacco unit volume (mainly in Egypt, Jordan and PMI Duty Free) and favorable cigarette mix (mainly in the GCC, PMI Duty Free and Turkey); and a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by combustible pricing (primarily in Egypt and Turkey); partially offset by lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets, shown in \"Cost/Other\".\n\nOperating  income,  excluding  currency  and  acquisitions,  increased  by  23.8%,  mainly  reflecting:  a  favorable  pricing  variance;  favorable volume/mix, driven by the same factors and geographies as for net revenues noted above; and lower manufacturing costs (primarily related to combustible products); partly offset by the unfavorable impact of the Saudi Arabia customs assessments, as noted above for net revenues; higher marketing, administration and research costs; and lower fees for certain distribution rights, as noted above for net revenues.\n\nMiddle East &amp; Africa - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\n\nThe estimated total market in the Middle East &amp; Africa increased by 2.9% to 560.5 billion units, mainly driven by:\n\n- Algeria, up by 6.2%, primarily reflecting the impact on adult smoker average daily consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures, partly offset by the impact of price increases;\n- Egypt, up by 8.8%, mainly reflecting a favorable comparison due to pandemic-related supply chain shortages for competitors' products in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of adult smoker in-switching to cigarettes (mainly in the low-tax tier) from other combustible tobacco products;\n- South Africa, up by 13.2%, primarily reflecting a favorable comparison versus the second and third quarters of 2020, in which the total market was impacted by the pandemic-related ban on all tobacco sales from March 27th through August 17th, partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade stemming from the ban; and\n- Turkey,  up  by  8.2%,  mainly  reflecting  the  impact  on  adult  smoker  average  daily  consumption  of  the  easing  of  pandemic-related measures,  coupled  with  increased  in-bound  tourism  (particularly  by  Turkish  expatriates),  partially  offset  by  a  higher  estimated prevalence of illicit trade;\n\n## partly offset by\n\n- International Duty Free, down by 10.6%, primarily reflecting the impact of government travel restrictions and reduced passenger traffic since the start of the pandemic in March 2020; and\n- Tunisia, down by 15.6%, mainly reflecting higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade (primarily due to market disruptions impacting product availability and the impact of price increases in July 2021).\n\nOur Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 23.1%.",

      "question": "Given Horizon's dependence on regulatory authorizations for HTS product commercialization and its strategic role in Altria's 'Moving Beyond Smoking' initiative, how might delays in FDA authorization impact Altria's timeline and financial commitment to transitioning adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives, especially considering the $2.9 billion NJOY acquisition in 2023?",
      "answer": "Horizon, Altria's joint venture with JTIUH, is explicitly described as being highly dependent on regulatory authorizations\u2014particularly from the FDA\u2014for the commercialization of heated tobacco stick (HTS) products in the U.S. The filing notes that failure to obtain or maintain such authorizations could negatively impact Horizon's ability to generate new revenue streams and enter new markets. This regulatory risk is compounded by Altria's broader strategic shift toward a smoke-free future, as emphasized in the 'Moving Beyond Smoking' initiative. The company's acquisition of NJOY in June 2023 for $2.9 billion further underscores its financial commitment to this transition. However, if Horizon experiences delays in securing regulatory approvals, Altria may face pressure to accelerate returns from NJOY or other smoke-free investments, potentially disrupting the overall timeline and financial feasibility of its smoke-free transition strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MO](page_10) \u2192 [Regulatory Authorizations]: Horizon's ability to commercialize HTS products is explicitly dependent on receipt of regulatory authorizations, particularly from the FDA, and failure to obtain or maintain these could negatively affect revenue generation and market expansion.",
        "Hop 2: [Regulatory Authorizations] \u2192 [Horizon]: Horizon is positioned as a key vehicle for Altria's smoke-free strategy, and its commercial success hinges on timely and sustained regulatory approvals for its HTS products.",
        "Hop 3: [Horizon] \u2190 [MO](page_4): Horizon is a core component of Altria's broader 'Moving Beyond Smoking' initiative, which aligns with the company's strategic and financial investments, such as the $2.9 billion acquisition of NJOY in 2023."

      "question": "How does Altria's ability to issue $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes in November 2023 relate to the structural guarantee provided by PM USA, especially considering the subsidiary's unconditional liability for debt obligations and its role in providing cash through dividends or distributions?",
      "answer": "Altria's ability to issue $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes in November 2023 is directly supported by the unconditional guarantee provided by PM USA, which assumes full liability for Altria\u2019s obligations under the debt instruments. The guarantee, described in detail in the filing, ensures that PM USA, as a 100% owned subsidiary and a core operating company, will unconditionally and absolutely guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest. This guarantee likely enhances the creditworthiness of the debt, making it more attractive to investors and potentially improving financing terms. Furthermore, because Altria is a holding company with no direct operations, its ability to service debt or issue new debt depends on cash flows from subsidiaries like PM USA, which can be accessed via dividends or intercompany interest payments. The guarantee, therefore, not only supports the current issuance but also signals structural financial backing that underpins Altria\u2019s broader debt strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MO](page_49) \u2192 [MO Debt Securities]: Altria filed a registration statement on Form S-3 in October 2023, allowing it to issue debt securities or warrants over a three-year period, including the $1.0 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in November 2023.",
        "Hop 2: [MO Debt Securities] \u2192 [PM USA]: PM USA fully and unconditionally guarantees Altria\u2019s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, including the November 2023 issuance, making it liable for timely payment of principal and interest.",
        "Hop 3: [PM USA] \u2190 [MO](page_74): As a 100% owned subsidiary and core operating company, PM USA provides Altria with access to operating cash flows through dividends or intercompany interest payments, which are essential for Altria to service and support its debt obligations."

of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2023. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "question": "How does Altria's indemnification arrangement with PMI for tobacco-related liabilities interact with PM USA's unconditional guarantee of Altria's $3.0 billion Credit Agreement obligations, particularly in light of PM USA's contingent liability exposure under fraudulent transfer laws?",
      "answer": "Altria has a distribution agreement with PMI under which PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured by PM USA for PMI. This indemnification is not recorded on Altria's balance sheet as its fair value is deemed insignificant. PM USA, in turn, unconditionally guarantees Altria's obligations under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement, among other debt instruments. However, under federal bankruptcy and fraudulent transfer laws, these guarantees could be voided or subordinated if PM USA is found to have received less than fair consideration or was insolvent at the time the obligations were incurred. This creates a complex liability chain where PMI's indemnification of PM USA could be critical to PM USA's ability to meet its guarantee obligations to Altria, especially if PM USA's financial position weakens and exposes it to fraudulent conveyance claims.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "answer": "The State Settlement Agreements restrict MO's ability to market and advertise flavored smokeless products through prohibitions on outdoor and transit advertising, brand sponsorships, and free sampling outside of adult-only facilities. These constraints are further compounded by the FSPTCA's Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, which was extended to synthetic nicotine products in April 2022 and prohibits brand-name sponsorships, restricts sampling, and limits promotional activities. Together, these regulatory frameworks significantly constrain MO's ability to promote new or existing flavored smokeless products, particularly in reaching adult consumers through traditional marketing channels. The combined effect of these restrictions could hinder MO's ability to compete effectively in the evolving smokeless tobacco market, especially as it seeks to transition adult smokers to less harmful alternatives.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on us, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 20. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings, (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products and (v) requires manufacturers of e-vapor products to certify that they are in compliance with FDA requirements to be allowed to sell in the state. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 24, 2025, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Utah) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, ex empt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway. The legislation in California, which became effective in December 2022, bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen.\n\nIndiana, Massachusetts and Utah passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. As of February 24, 2025, legislation relating to this issue is pending in three other states.\n\nSimilar restrictions to those enacted or proposed in various U.S. states and localities on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products have been enacted or proposed internationally.\n\nWe have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. Certain legislation imposing restrictions on tobacco products, such as state laws requiring manufacturers of e-vapor products to certify that they are in compliance with federal law in order to sell products in the state, aligns with our V ision, and we actively engage with lawmakers in support of such legislation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to smoke-free products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n- Federal, State and Local Legislation to Increase the Legal Age to Purchase Tobacco Products: In December 2019, after a number of states and localities proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, the federal government passed legislation increasing the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, to 21 nationwide. As of February 24, 2025, 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted laws increasing the legal age to purchase tobacco products to 21. Although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on our operating companies' sales volumes, we support raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels, as discussed above under Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products , reflecting our longstanding commitment to combat underage tobacco use.\n- Health Effects of Tobacco Products, Including E -vapor Products: Reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years, including various reports by the U.S. Surgeon General. We believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the U.S. Surgeon General and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products, including e-vapor products. Along with the scientific and public health communities, we continue to study and gather scientific evidence concerning the health effects of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco ex posure and the impact of such",

For the fourth quarter of 2024, the discount share of the cigarette category reached 30.4%, an increase of 0.6 share points sequentially and an increase of 1.7 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe continue to monitor the evolving regulatory, macroeconomic and consumer dynamics within our business environment for impacts on our businesses. Changes in these and other conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## FSPTCA and FDA Regulation\n\n- The Regulatory Framework: The FSPTCA and its related regulations establish broad FDA regulatory authority over all tobacco products and, among other provisions:\n- impose restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products (see Final Tobacco Marketing Rule below);\n- establish pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products (see Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below);\n- prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;\n- authorize the FDA to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (see Potential Product Standards below); and\n- equip the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities (see Investigation and Enforcement below).\n\nThe FSPTCA also bans descriptors such as 'light,' 'low' or 'mild' when used as descriptors of modified risk, unless expressly authorized by the FDA.\n\nEffective April 2022, the U.S. Congress expanded the statutory definition of tobacco products to include products containing nicotine derived from any source, including synthetic nicotine. See Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below for additional information on the effects of the statutory change. Currently, however, the statutory definition of tobacco products does not cover products containing nicotine analogues, which are designed to imitate the effects of nicotine. As a result, products containing nicotine analogues are not subject to the FDA regulatory framework for tobacco products, including the requirements that manufacturers submit a PMTA to, and receive an MGO from, the FDA before marketing such products in the United States.\n\n- Final Tobacco Marketing Rule: As required by the FSPTCA, in March 2010, the FDA promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products (the 'Final Tobacco Marketing Rule'). The May 2016 deeming regulations amended the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule to expand specific provisions to all tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco and e-vapor and oral nicotine products containing tobacco-derived nicotine or other tobacco derivatives. (1)\n\nThe Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, as amended, among other things:\n\n- restricts the use of non-tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products;\n- prohibits sampling of all tobacco products except that sampling of smokeless tobacco products is permitted in qualified adult-only facilities;\n- prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos;\n- prohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical, artistic or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event; and\n- requires the development by the FDA of graphic warnings for cigarettes, establishes warning requirements for other tobacco products and gives the FDA the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco product (see FDA Regulatory Actions - Graphic Warnings below).\n\nSubject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule took effect in June 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products containing tobacco-derived nicotine, and in April 2022 for tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products, that contain nicotine from any source other than tobacco, such as synthetic nicotine. The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule currently does not apply to products containing nicotine analogues.\n\n- Rulemaking and Guidance: From time to time, the FDA issues proposed regulations and guidance, which may be issued in draft or final form, that generally involve public comment and may include scientific review. The FDA also may request comments on\n\n'Smokeless tobacco,' as used in this section of this Form 10-K, refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the FDA in 2009, including MST. It excludes oral nicotine pouches, which were first regulated by the FDA in 2016. (1)",

Following the 60-day pause, the proposed product standard, if not withdrawn, may proceed through the rulemaking process, including the solicitation of public comment, which we believe would take multiple years to complete.\n- Flavors in Tobacco Products : In April 2022, the FDA issued two proposed product standards: (i) banning menthol in cigarettes and (ii) banning all characterizing flavors (including menthol) in cigars. We submitted comments during the notice-and-comment period. In October 2023, the FDA submitted the two proposed product standards to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. In April 2024, the FDA announced the indefinite delay of a decision on the menthol ban, citing the high volume of feedback received during the notice-and-comment period. In January 2025, the Trump Administration withdrew the two proposed product standards from the Office of Management and Budget ('OMB') and sent them back to the FDA.\n- N-nitrosonornicotine ('NNN') in Smokeless Tobacco : In January 2017, the FDA proposed a product standard for NNN levels in finished smokeless tobacco products.\n\nIf any one or more of the foregoing potential product standards were to become final and was appealed and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, including a material adverse effect on the carrying value of certain of our assets such as our cigar trademarks.\n\n- Tobacco Product Manufacturing Practices: In March 2023, the FDA, pursuant to the requirements of the FSPTCA, issued a proposed rule setting forth requirements for tobacco product manufacturers regarding the manufacture, design, packing and storage of their products. This proposed rule establishes a framework of tobacco product manufacturing practices, including by:\n- establishing tobacco product design and development controls;\n- ensuring that finished and bulk tobacco products are manufactured according to established specifications;\n- minimizing the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products that do not meet specifications;\n- requiring manufacturers to take appropriate measures to prevent contamination of tobacco products;\n- requiring investigation and identification of products that do not meet specifications and requiring manufacturers to institute appropriate corrective actions, such as a recall; and\n- establishing the ability to trace all components or parts, ingredients, additives and materials, as well as each batch of finished or bulk tobacco products, to aid in investigations of those that do not meet specifications.\n\nWe engaged with the FDA through the rulemaking process, including during the notice-and-comment period, which closed in October 2023. OMB currently lists the rule as a long-term action. If the proposed rule were to take effect, our operating companies could experience increased costs to comply with the rule.\n\n- Impact on Our Business; Compliance Costs and User Fees: Additional FDA regulatory actions under the FSPTCA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position in various ways. For ex ample, actions (or inaction) by the FDA could:\n- impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products;\n- discontinue, delay or prevent the sale or distribution of ex isting, new or modified tobacco products;\n- limit adult tobacco consumer choices;\n- impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers;\n- create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies;\n- impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements;\n- impose additional restrictions at retail;\n- result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products; and\n- otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.\n\nThe FSPTCA imposes user fees on cigarette, cigarette tobacco, smokeless tobacco, cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters. The FSPTCA does not impose user fees on e-vapor products or oral nicotine pouch manufacturers. The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations. Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below for a discussion of our FDA user fee payments. In addition, our operating companies' compliance with the FSPTCA's regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year-to-date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate.

      "question": "How does PMI's $194 million litigation-related charge in Canada relate to its ability to fully commercialize Platform 1 in the U.S., given the constraints imposed by the 2006 RICO Order that applies to its affiliate PM USA?",
      "answer": "PMI recorded a $194 million litigation-related charge in the first quarter of 2019 related to Canadian class-action cases, reflecting its assessment of probable and estimable loss. This financial exposure highlights the significant liabilities PMI faces, which could constrain strategic investments, including the commercialization of Platform 1. However, PMI announced in 2022 that it would take full control of Platform 1 commercialization in the U.S., the world's largest smoke-free market. The U.S. government has raised concerns that this transition falls under the scope of the 2006 RICO Order to which PM USA is subject, which restricts transfers of cigarette brands or formulas unless the transferee submits to the court's jurisdiction and the Order's requirements. Since PMI was not a party to the 2006 Order, it must now navigate potential legal hurdles that could delay or alter its commercialization plans. Thus, while PMI has expressed confidence in overcoming these constraints, the litigation-related financial burden and regulatory entanglement with the 2006 Order could jointly impact the pace and scope of Platform 1\u2019s expansion in the U.S. market.",

      "answer": "Target's RedCard penetration rate declined from 19.8% in 2022 to 18.6% in 2023, indicating a drop in the proportion of purchases made using RedCards, which include the Target Credit Card and Target MasterCard. Since TD underwrites, funds, and owns the receivables from these cards, they bear the credit risk and manage the profitability of the program. Target receives a percentage of the profits generated by these cards in exchange for marketing and servicing functions. Therefore, the decline in RedCard usage could reduce the overall profitability of the credit card program, which would in turn lower the profit-sharing payments Target receives from TD.",

In the AMEA region, biscuits accounted for 7.8% of net revenues, the highest among all product categories in that region.

The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million in 2021. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable volume mix reflected volume declines as the region lapped prior-year strong volume growth driven by significantly increased food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic as well as impacts from labor disruptions and supply chain constraints in the second half of 2021. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits, candy, chocolate and gum.\n\nSegment operating income decreased $216 million (13.6%), primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs, higher Simplify to Grow Program costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower COVID-19 related costs), a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs (lower incremental COVID-19 related costs and productivity) and favorable currency.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $1,049 million (14.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (6.3 pp), the impact of acquisitions (6.3 pp) and higher net pricing (2.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix, in part due to the positive volume impact from COVID-19 as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption, was driven by gains in biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, chocolate and candy. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, chocolate and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.\n\nSegment operating income increased $136 million (9.4%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing and the impact of acquisitions. These favorable items were partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher raw material costs, lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation changes and higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program.",

      "answer": "The $35 million in appeal bonds posted by PM USA on page 92 represents security provided to obtain stays of adverse litigation judgments pending appeal. These bonds are collateralized with restricted cash and appear on the consolidated balance sheet as assets. On page 74, PM USA is described as a guarantor of Altria's outstanding debt securities, including the $1.0 billion in senior notes issued in November 2023. The guarantee is unconditional and requires PM USA to ensure payment of Altria's obligations, regardless of the validity or enforceability of the underlying debt agreements. Both the appeal bonds and the debt guarantees expose PM USA to significant financial obligations, with the appeal bonds already collateralized and the debt guarantees potentially triggering similar collateral requirements in the event of default or financial stress.",

In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "answer": "Philip Morris faces intense competition in Thailand, where local and international tobacco firms operate under a regulatory environment that may restrict product differentiation and pricing strategies. This competitive pressure is compounded by the unresolved WTO panel decision from 2010, which ruled against Thailand\u2019s customs valuation practices affecting PM Thailand\u2019s imports, yet full compliance by Thailand remains unachieved. The ongoing dispute and potential for retroactive tax adjustments or customs revaluations create regulatory uncertainty that could materially impact Philip Morris's profitability and market position in Thailand, especially as the company seeks to maintain or grow margins in a price-sensitive and highly regulated market.",

          "chunk_text": "## Risks Related to our Competitive Environment\n\n## We face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Governmental Investigations\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices. We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country.

Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6.

Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country.

      "answer": "The fair value of the contingent consideration for Clif Bar increased from $440 million at the acquisition date to $548 million as of December 31, 2023. This change reflects the ongoing reliance on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) in MDLZ's financial reporting, as the liability is entirely categorized under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuation methodology, which includes financial projections for net revenue, gross profit, and EBITDA, along with discount and volatility rates, indicates that the updated estimate is based on internal assumptions rather than observable market data. This highlights the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future performance metrics for Clif Bar and the sensitivity of the contingent consideration to these assumptions.",

of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2023. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

      "answer": "MO's strategic investment in Horizon, a joint venture focused on HTS product commercialization, is positioned as a key avenue for expanding into new smoke-free product categories. However, Horizon's success is explicitly tied to the receipt of regulatory authorizations, which are uncertain and subject to lengthy FDA review timelines. This uncertainty directly influences the assumptions used in MO's 2024 annual impairment testing of the e-vapor reporting unit, where the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals for innovative tobacco products\u2014including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor devices\u2014are critical inputs in estimating future cash flows and fair value. Without timely regulatory authorizations, Horizon's ability to generate new revenue streams is jeopardized, which in turn could negatively impact the valuation and future impairment risk of MO's e-vapor assets, including goodwill and intangible assets valued at $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion respectively.",

If the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative does not reject the ITC's decision, the restrictions will take effect on March 31, 2025 or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse.\n\nThe success of Horizon, our joint venture with JTIUH for the marketing and commercialization of HTS products in the United States, in generating new revenue streams by commercializing current and future HTS products owned by us or Japan Tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include (i) receipt of regulatory authorizations, (ii) prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting the parties or their plans for future collaboration and partnerships, (iii) changes in market or other conditions resulting in unanticipated delays in the design and development of future products or the commencement of test launches, (iv) the outcome of any legal proceedings or investigations that may be instituted against the parties or others related to the joint venture, (v) changes in the preferences of U.S. adult tobacco consumers, (vi) the failure to meet commercialization milestones and (vii) the ability of the parties to enter into future partnerships on terms acceptable to both parties and in the ex pected manner or timeframe, if at all. Such factors could have a negative effect on our ability to generate new revenue streams and enter new geographic markets.\n\nLengthy and unpredictable regulatory review periods complicate efforts to strategize and plan with respect to commercialization of new products, and we cannot predict or influence the speed with which the FDA reviews PMTAs. For example, a protracted FDA review of one of our operating companies' PMTAs would allow competitive products already on the market to establish market share, brand recognition and adult tobacco consumer loyalty in the absence of competition from our product. If we do not succeed in commercializing innovative tobacco products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers or we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization for the marketing or sale of these products, including with claims of reduced health risks, we could be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nOur inability to successfully counter the effects of illicit trade in tobacco products, including e-v apor products, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achiev e our Vision.\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and the diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another jurisdiction. Counterfeit versions of our operating companies' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands as well as other stakeholders' perceptions and opinions of our companies and brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing legislative or regulatory requirements, or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are legally distributed and sold, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nIn the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased, and such products now comprise the majority of the e-vapor category. The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers that has contributed to higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines. Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit disposable e-vapor products. This dynamic has made the operating environment challenging for our businesses. We have increased engagement with the FDA and other government agencies to encourage enforcement action against these illicit products, but such enforcement has been inadequate to date. We also have taken legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor business, which exposes us to additional costs and expenses. Our failure to counter the impacts of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the FDA's failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nFailure to complete or manage strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties, or realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties. Opportunities for strategic transactions may be limited, and the success of any such transaction is dependent upon our ability to complete and realize the expected benefits of the transaction in the expected time frame or at all. Following the completion of a transaction there may be certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent and operational risks, including diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating other businesses into existing operations and other challenges presented by a transaction",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "question": "How does the contingent consideration liability for Clif Bar, measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), relate to the impact of the acquisition on MDLZ's 2023 operating income and expense trends?",
      "answer": "MDLZ reported a contingent consideration liability of $548 million for Clif Bar as of December 31, 2023, which was measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). This liability is tied to the August 1, 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar, which contributed to a $618 million increase in total selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2023 due to higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Despite these costs, MDLZ's operating income margin increased from 11.2% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023, partly due to lapping prior-year acquisition-related costs and favorable changes in mark-to-market gains from hedging activities. The continued expense pressure from the Clif Bar acquisition was therefore offset by broader operational improvements and pricing discipline.",

The integration of Swedish Match into PM's regional reporting structure was scheduled to begin in Q1 2024, indicating that ZYN\u2019s performance in 2023 was not yet fully incorporated into PM\u2019s regional business analysis or contributing to the 2023 shipment growth.

      "answer": "Altria relies on PM USA as a 100% owned subsidiary to fully and unconditionally guarantee its corporate debt obligations, which include senior unsecured notes and credit agreements. However, despite this strong financial linkage, PM USA has only posted $35 million in appeal bonds, collateralized by restricted cash, to secure stays of adverse litigation judgments. This limited liquidity commitment for litigation risk contrasts with the magnitude of PM USA's guarantee of Altria's broader debt obligations, raising questions about the prioritization and allocation of financial resources between debt servicing and litigation risk mitigation.",

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "answer": "The unresolved WTO panel decision from 2010 concluded that Thailand had no basis to challenge the customs valuation and tax treatment of PM Thailand's cigarette imports, yet Thailand has not fully complied with the ruling. This unresolved regulatory issue creates ongoing uncertainty for Philip Morris in Thailand, a market where the company already faces intense competition and regulatory pressures. Meanwhile, in the competitive environment section, Philip Morris notes that in Thailand, it competes against state-owned enterprises and regional players that may be less susceptible to currency fluctuations and may engage in unfair competition. The combination of unresolved customs disputes and the competitive landscape suggests that Philip Morris may face both operational and strategic disadvantages in Thailand, limiting its ability to effectively compete under consistent and fair regulatory conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Governmental Investigations\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices. We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nThese developments above have or may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\n\nFor further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nThese developments above have or may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\n\nFor further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

One of these plans is funded through a VEBA trust, which holds primarily liquid assets to meet the timing and level of expected future benefit payments, as detailed on page 103. This alignment reflects a coordinated strategy where the defined-dollar structure limits long-term liability exposure, while the VEBA\u2019s liquid asset allocation ensures that funds are available to meet near-term obligations.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

      "question": "How does MO's reliance on regulatory authorizations for future revenue growth from innovative tobacco products, particularly in relation to Horizon's commercialization efforts, reconcile with the uncertainty surrounding the FDA's PMTA review timelines and Horizon's strategic importance as a joint venture with JTIUH?",
      "answer": "MO identifies regulatory authorizations as a critical factor for the success of Horizon, which is a joint venture with JTIUH aimed at commercializing heat-not-burn tobacco products (HTS) in the U.S. The company acknowledges that Horizon's ability to generate new revenue streams is heavily dependent on receiving these authorizations. However, MO also highlights the unpredictability of the FDA's PMTA review process, which could delay product launches and allow competitors to capture market share. This uncertainty contrasts with Horizon's strategic importance as MO's primary vehicle for entering the HTS market, as emphasized in the MD&A section where Horizon is described as a majority-owned joint venture central to the company's 'Moving Beyond Smoking' initiative. The sensitivity of Horizon's revenue potential to regulatory timelines raises concerns about MO's ability to meet its long-term financial forecasts, especially given that a 1% increase in the discount rate used in the 2024 impairment test could have triggered a $125 million impairment charge for the e-vapor reporting unit, indicating high sensitivity to forecast assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmaterial non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets (carrying value of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024), or both, in future periods. Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

If the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative does not reject the ITC's decision, the restrictions will take effect on March 31, 2025 or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse.\n\nThe success of Horizon, our joint venture with JTIUH for the marketing and commercialization of HTS products in the United States, in generating new revenue streams by commercializing current and future HTS products owned by us or Japan Tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include (i) receipt of regulatory authorizations, (ii) prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting the parties or their plans for future collaboration and partnerships, (iii) changes in market or other conditions resulting in unanticipated delays in the design and development of future products or the commencement of test launches, (iv) the outcome of any legal proceedings or investigations that may be instituted against the parties or others related to the joint venture, (v) changes in the preferences of U.S. adult tobacco consumers, (vi) the failure to meet commercialization milestones and (vii) the ability of the parties to enter into future partnerships on terms acceptable to both parties and in the ex pected manner or timeframe, if at all. Such factors could have a negative effect on our ability to generate new revenue streams and enter new geographic markets.\n\nLengthy and unpredictable regulatory review periods complicate efforts to strategize and plan with respect to commercialization of new products, and we cannot predict or influence the speed with which the FDA reviews PMTAs. For example, a protracted FDA review of one of our operating companies' PMTAs would allow competitive products already on the market to establish market share, brand recognition and adult tobacco consumer loyalty in the absence of competition from our product. If we do not succeed in commercializing innovative tobacco products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers or we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization for the marketing or sale of these products, including with claims of reduced health risks, we could be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nOur inability to successfully counter the effects of illicit trade in tobacco products, including e-v apor products, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achiev e our Vision.\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and the diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another jurisdiction. Counterfeit versions of our operating companies' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands as well as other stakeholders' perceptions and opinions of our companies and brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing legislative or regulatory requirements, or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are legally distributed and sold, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nIn the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased, and such products now comprise the majority of the e-vapor category. The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers that has contributed to higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines. Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit disposable e-vapor products. This dynamic has made the operating environment challenging for our businesses. We have increased engagement with the FDA and other government agencies to encourage enforcement action against these illicit products, but such enforcement has been inadequate to date. We also have taken legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor business, which exposes us to additional costs and expenses. Our failure to counter the impacts of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the FDA's failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nFailure to complete or manage strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties, or realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties. Opportunities for strategic transactions may be limited, and the success of any such transaction is dependent upon our ability to complete and realize the expected benefits of the transaction in the expected time frame or at all. Following the completion of a transaction there may be certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent and operational risks, including diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating other businesses into existing operations and other challenges presented by a transaction",

However, AMEA's operating income was $691 million, indicating that while Cheese & Grocery contributes to revenue, it may not be proportionally driving profitability. Cheese & Grocery accounted for 1.7% of AMEA\u2019s total 2021 product revenue mix, suggesting it is a smaller, potentially lower-margin category compared to Biscuits (7.8%) and Chocolate (8.3%) in that region.

      "answer": "Altria issued $1.0 billion in new senior notes in November 2023, which are unconditionally guaranteed by PM USA. These guarantees expose PM USA to significant financial obligations, as it is a 100% owned subsidiary responsible for Altria's debt payments. At the same time, PM USA itself faces substantial liquidity commitments, including an average of $3.4 billion in annual payments under State Settlement Agreements through 2024. This creates a dual financial strain, where PM USA must both guarantee Altria's new debt and meet its own large-scale obligations, raising concerns about its capacity to manage both without impacting cash flow or creditworthiness.",

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA.

The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "answer": "PMI recorded a $2,316 million non-cash impairment charge for its investment in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) due to uncertainty and developments regarding the unresolved allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion global settlement amount under the CCAA Proposed Plan. The CCAA proceedings, initiated by RBH in 2019, resulted in PMI deconsolidating RBH and accounting for its investment as an equity security. As of December 31, 2024, PMI determined that the fair value of its investment was significantly lower than its carrying value, primarily due to the unresolved allocation issue among RBH, ITL, and JTIM under the Proposed Plan. Despite the lack of an agreed allocation or court ruling, PMI used estimates and assumptions\u2014such as the allocation share of RBH, sales volumes, and operating margins\u2014to calculate the impairment. Thus, the impairment charge directly reflects PMI\u2019s assessment of the financial impact of the unresolved CCAA settlement allocation.",

The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual ex perience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. While, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation, litigation is subject to uncertainty. Additionally, as reported further below, beginning in March 2024, litigation related to oral nicotine products was filed against us and our subsidiary before certain courts in the United States.\n\nWe and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 18. Contingencies, it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIt is possible that our consolidated financial statements, including our results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\nAfter assessing the information available to it, ex cept as stated otherwise in this Note 18. Contingencies , (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\n\nCCAA Proceedings and Stay of Combustible Tobacco Product-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019.\n\nAs part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 3, 2025 or the date on which the CCAA court issues an order on the Sanction Motion (discussed below) of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .' Ernst &amp; Y oung Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be ex tended by the stay period.\n\nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada. On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation against RBH, its affiliates, and its affiliates' indemnitees. The court-appointed mediator and monitors also filed substantially similar proposed plans for ITL and JTIM.\n\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM (together, the 'Companies') would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approx imately $22.3 billion). This amount would be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies' cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits (subject to an aggregate withholding of CAD 750 million (approximately $514 million) of working capital) and annual payments based on a percentage of the Companies' aggregate net income after taxes (excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full. As stated in the Proposed Plan, the issue of allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM (\"Allocation Issue\") remains unresolved.

('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.

These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .' Ernst &amp; Y oung Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be ex tended by the stay period.\n\nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada.

PMI holds an approximate 25% economic interest in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Tabacs Alg\u00e9ro-Emiratie ('STAEM'), an Algerian joint venture that is  51% owned by EITA and 49% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et D\u00e9veloppement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI's brands (SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment).\n\nIn  April  2023,  PMI  acquired  an  approx imate  economic  interest  of 25%  in  United  Tobacco  Company  (\"UTC\").  UTC  is  an  entity  incorporated  in  Egypt  which manufactures products under license for PMI's Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of 14.7% in Eastern Company ('Eastern\"), Egypt's largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes. In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The max imum amount of these guarantee obligations is $385 million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.\n\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV , EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded  at  cost  and  are  included  in  equity  investments  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Transactions  between  these  equity  method  investees  and  PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below.\n\n## Equity securities:\n\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH') obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.\n\nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $3,280 million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global",

      "answer": "Cronos, in which Altria holds an equity investment, is subject to FDA regulations that govern its cannabis-derived products. These regulatory risks could result in litigation, fines, or reputational harm, which would directly affect Cronos\u2019s financial performance. Altria accounts for its investment in Cronos using the equity method of accounting with a one-quarter lag. This means that any financial impact from FDA-related penalties or disruptions at Cronos would not be reflected in Altria\u2019s financial statements until the following quarter. As a result, Altria may face delayed recognition of these risks, potentially leading to misalignment between real-time operational challenges at Cronos and their financial reporting within Altria\u2019s consolidated statements.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's exchange-traded commodity futures, classified as Level 1 financial liabilities and valued at $X (hypothetical placeholder for actual value from page 112), directly impact earnings volatility because these instruments are marked-to-market through earnings without the deferral benefits of hedge accounting. This creates tension with MDLZ's stated hedging strategy (page 94), where they use commodity futures to mitigate price risk on forecasted purchases of raw materials like cocoa, sugar, and wheat. Despite these hedging activities, the fair value changes in Level 1 commodity futures are immediately recognized in earnings, exposing MDLZ to short-term volatility even as they attempt to manage long-term input cost risks. This accounting treatment contrasts with their Level 2 instruments, which may be designated as hedges and have their fair value changes deferred through accumulated other comprehensive earnings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Any unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market impacts)",

      "answer": "Altria's reliance on its Commercial Paper Program introduces financial risk due to its dependence on PM USA's unconditional guarantees to support short-term liquidity needs. PM USA, as a 100% owned subsidiary, fully and unconditionally guarantees Altria's obligations under the commercial paper program, making it directly liable for any defaults. However, PM USA also faces significant fixed obligations, including $3.4 billion in annual payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, which could constrain its ability to fulfill guarantee obligations if cash flows are strained. This interdependency increases Altria's financial risk, as the parent company's access to operating cash flows is contingent on PM USA's financial health and its capacity to meet both its guaranteed obligations and its own fixed commitments.",

of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2023. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "question": "How does Altria's $2.9 billion acquisition of NJOY compare with its prior equity stake in JUUL, given NJOY's unique FDA market authorization status and Altria's stated strategic focus on transitioning adult smokers to less harmful alternatives?",
      "answer": "Altria's $2.9 billion acquisition of NJOY, which became a wholly owned subsidiary on June 1, 2023, represents a significant strategic commitment to the e-vapor category. This contrasts with Altria's earlier equity stake in JUUL, which it relinquished in March 2023 in exchange for a non-exclusive, irrevocable global license to certain heated tobacco intellectual property. Notably, NJOY is the only e-vapor manufacturer to have received market authorizations from the FDA for a pod-based e-vapor product, a regulatory milestone that likely factored into Altria's decision to directly acquire and integrate NJOY into its portfolio. This acquisition aligns with Altria\u2019s stated Vision to transition adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives and supports its broader 'Moving Beyond Smoking' initiative, distinguishing it from the more limited rights retained from the JUUL relationship.",

        "Hop 2: [E-Vapor Products] \u2192 [NJOY]: NJOY is the company that manufactures and sells e-vapor products, and it holds the distinction of being the only e-vapor manufacturer with FDA market authorization for a pod-based product.",
        "Hop 3: [NJOY] \u2190 [MO](page_60): Altria completed the acquisition of NJOY, making it a wholly owned subsidiary, which contrasts with Altria\u2019s prior equity stake in JUUL that was transferred in 2023."

      "question": "How does the 1.9% revenue contribution from beverages in AMEA compare with the absolute beverage revenue figures reported for that region in 2019 and 2021, and what might this suggest about the category's relative performance and strategic importance in AMEA?",
      "answer": "In 2019, AMEA reported $546 million in beverage revenue, which represented 1.9% of its total net revenues. In 2021, beverage revenue in AMEA remained relatively flat at $550 million, yet this accounted for a smaller proportion (1.9%) of a larger overall revenue base. Despite the slight increase in absolute terms, the consistent percentage suggests beverages maintained a minor but stable role in AMEA's product portfolio. This may indicate limited growth potential or a niche positioning for beverages in that region.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between PMI's $2,316 million impairment charge for its Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. investment and the unresolved CAD 32.5 billion CCAA settlement allocation, and how does this uncertainty affect PMI's contingent liabilities under the Proposed Plan?",
      "answer": "PMI recorded a $2,316 million non-cash impairment charge for its investment in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) due to the uncertainty surrounding the allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion CCAA settlement among RBH, ITL, and JTIM. This unresolved allocation issue was a key factor in PMI\u2019s determination that the fair value of its investment had declined below its carrying value. The Proposed Plan under the CCAA proceedings would require RBH and other defendants to make aggregate payments toward the settlement, but since the allocation remains undetermined, PMI faces contingent liabilities tied to RBH\u2019s ultimate share of the settlement. As a result, PMI must account for potential future losses that could arise depending on how the court ultimately allocates the CAD 32.5 billion liability among the parties involved.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM(page_99) \u2192 CCAA: PMI\u2019s subsidiary RBH sought protection under the CCAA in 2019, leading to its deconsolidation and the subsequent impairment of PMI\u2019s investment due to the unresolved settlement allocation.",
        "Hop 2: CCAA \u2192 Rothmans,Benson & Hedges Inc.: The CCAA proceedings are directly tied to RBH, which is a party to the Proposed Plan involving a CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement for Canadian tobacco litigation.",
        "Hop 3: Rothmans,Benson & Hedges Inc. \u2190 PM(page_130): The unresolved allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion settlement among RBH, ITL, and JTIM creates contingent liabilities for PMI, as RBH remains a key entity in the CCAA proceedings and its financial obligations could impact PMI through guarantees and indemnifications."

PMI holds an approximate 25% economic interest in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Tabacs Alg\u00e9ro-Emiratie ('STAEM'), an Algerian joint venture that is  51% owned by EITA and 49% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et D\u00e9veloppement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI's brands (SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment).\n\nIn  April  2023,  PMI  acquired  an  approx imate  economic  interest  of 25%  in  United  Tobacco  Company  (\"UTC\").  UTC  is  an  entity  incorporated  in  Egypt  which manufactures products under license for PMI's Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of 14.7% in Eastern Company ('Eastern\"), Egypt's largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes. In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The max imum amount of these guarantee obligations is $385 million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.\n\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV , EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded  at  cost  and  are  included  in  equity  investments  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Transactions  between  these  equity  method  investees  and  PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below.\n\n## Equity securities:\n\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH') obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.\n\nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $3,280 million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global",
