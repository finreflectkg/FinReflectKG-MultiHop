      "question": "How does Microsoft's direct sales strategy for cloud services, as outlined in their distribution model, align with the integration of Nuance's cloud offerings into Azure's revenue growth metrics, given Nuance's role in the Intelligent Cloud segment's financial reporting?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's direct sales strategy includes selling cloud services through digital marketplaces and online stores, emphasizing direct engagement with customers. Following the acquisition of Nuance in Q3 2022, Nuance's cloud services were integrated into Azure and other cloud services revenue, contributing to the Server products and cloud services growth metric. As part of the Intelligent Cloud segment, Nuance\u2019s financials are now included in Microsoft\u2019s internal segmented profit and loss statements, which are used to assess the health of the commercial business. This alignment demonstrates how Microsoft's direct sales focus supports the growth of acquired cloud assets like Nuance within its broader cloud revenue strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm has $12.8 billion in total purchase obligations, primarily for integrated circuit product inventory, indicating a significant financial commitment to maintaining production capacity and supply chain relationships. However, Samsung, one of Qualcomm's largest customers, is also a competitor that develops its own integrated circuit products and has increasingly used them in its devices rather than Qualcomm's chips. This vertical integration by Samsung threatens Qualcomm's semiconductor revenue stream, despite Qualcomm's heavy investment in supplier commitments. The tension between Qualcomm's financial exposure to manufacturing and the strategic risk of losing Samsung as a customer highlights a misalignment between capital allocation and customer retention risk in the semiconductor business.",

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was nine years and eight years, respectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $184 million, $204 million and $207 million, respectively. At September 29, 2024, other assets included $719 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $708 million recorded in other liabilities. At September 24, 2023, other assets included $612 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $571 million recorded in other liabilities.\n\nAt September 29, 2024, future lease payments under our operating leases were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Mobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors' integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless networks, which may enable such competitors to better optimize their integrated circuit products for performance on those networks; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions.\n\nIn addition, certain of our largest customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers, such as Apple and Samsung, have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize or may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers; limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us; or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows, and/or enabling critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development, and commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nCompetition in any or all product areas or device tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees' products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n\n## Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are ex acerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices, including motor vehicles or motor vehicle systems. We routinely monitor for and assess security vulnerabilities in our products and offer remediation measures if appropriate. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or provide remediation measures for vulnerabilities (or our customers may fail to implement remediation measures) before they are exploited.\n\nOur products may be used in devices that interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content, which creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers' products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers' products or IT infrastructure.

      "answer": "Apple identifies Taiwan as a critical part of its supply chain and highlights it as a geopolitical risk due to its location within a region prone to trade disputes, public health crises, and other disruptions. Despite these concerns, the Greater China segment\u2014which includes Taiwan\u2014delivered strong financial results in 2022 with $74.2 billion in net sales and $31.153 billion in operating income, reflecting the region's importance to Apple's revenue and profitability.

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

This creates a risk of significant revenue reversals if the preliminary estimates materially differ from actual reported sales, especially in cases where licensees are already disputing or non-compliant with contractual obligations. Although the company applies judgment to constrain revenue recognition when significant reversal risks exist, the binding arbitration provisions in license agreements do not prevent revenue recognition delays, further amplifying the volatility and uncertainty in reported licensing revenues.",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nLicense agreements contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that ex ists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated.\n\nLicensees pay per-unit royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and, to a lesser ex tent, lump sum payments (license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). License fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licenseeby-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is ex ecuted and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement. If all such conditions are not met, revenues and any associated receivables are generally not recognized until such time that the required conditions are met. Cash collected from customers prior to a contract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting, underpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items, evaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees' conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other items, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are newly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues have been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and enforceable right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\n\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\n\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable, net (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied",

      "answer": "Accenture's strategy (page 6) emphasizes being a reinvention partner for clients through AI and digital transformation, with a focus on long-term value creation and client differentiation. However, the company acknowledges (page 22) that many of its contracts, particularly in consulting, are short-term and can be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, posing operational risks if clients delay or cancel engagements. This exposure is further detailed (page 43), where it is disclosed that only the non-cancelable portion of contracts is included in performance obligations, and a significant portion of contract bookings lacks binding commitment. The contradiction lies in the strategic intent to build long-term client partnerships while operating under contract terms that limit revenue predictability and expose the company to sudden client decisions to terminate engagements, which could undermine the financial stability needed to support ongoing innovation and client-specific investments.",

      "question": "How does Intel's divestiture of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, including the Dalian fabrication facility, align with its continued manufacturing and sale of NAND wafers using those same assets until the second closing?",
      "answer": "Intel signed an agreement with SK hynix in October 2020 to divest its NAND memory business, including the Dalian fabrication facility and related tangible assets (Fab Assets), as well as the NAND SSD Business, with the first closing completed on December 29, 2021. Despite selling the Fab Assets, Intel entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement with SK hynix, under which Intel continued to manufacture and sell NAND memory wafers using those very assets until the second closing. This indicates a transitional manufacturing arrangement that allows Intel to maintain short-term production continuity while gradually exiting the NAND memory manufacturing space.",

NSG is disrupting the memory and storage hierarchy with new tiers that balance capacity, performance, and cost. Our products are available in innovative form factors and densities to address the memory and storage challenges our customers face in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience. Put simply, in today's data-driven world, advances in both data center and client computing need to be matched by cutting-edge innovation in the memoryand-storage space.\"\n\n-Rob Crooke, NSG General Manager\n\n## 5-Year Trends",

The first closing was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. At first closing, we sold to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business. In connection with the first closing, we and certain affiliates of SK hynix also entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China until the second closing.\n\n## Products and Competitiveness\n\nWe compete against other providers of NAND products. We offer 96-layer and 64-layer TLC NAND high-capacity SSDs, and 144-layer QLC NAND highcapacity SSDs. We focus our efforts primarily on incorporating NAND into solution products.\n\nThe acceleration in data growth across our customer base requires significant innovation in storage technology. Our storage roadmap led the way in reimagining usages and architecting innovative solutions that have disrupted the industry with 96-layer and 144-layer 3D NAND TLC and QLC solutions.

The first closing was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. At first closing, we sold to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business. In connection with the first closing, we and certain affiliates of SK hynix also entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China until the second closing.\n\n## Products and Competitiveness\n\nWe compete against other providers of NAND products. We offer 96-layer and 64-layer TLC NAND high-capacity SSDs, and 144-layer QLC NAND highcapacity SSDs. We focus our efforts primarily on incorporating NAND into solution products.\n\nThe acceleration in data growth across our customer base requires significant innovation in storage technology. Our storage roadmap led the way in reimagining usages and architecting innovative solutions that have disrupted the industry with 96-layer and 144-layer 3D NAND TLC and QLC solutions. We launched four new products with multiple densities to keep up with the evolving business needs of our customers.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's risk exposure to Chinese OEMs, as emphasized in the risk factors section, relate to the company's strategic focus on integrated circuit product development and its financial dependence on these same products?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's risk factors section highlights its significant revenue dependence on Chinese OEMs, noting that these OEMs are increasing their device share both in China and globally. This dependence is compounded by the potential for these OEMs to develop their own integrated circuit products, driven by initiatives like China's Made in China 2025 campaign, which could reduce Qualcomm's revenue stream. Meanwhile, the company's integrated circuit products are central to its semiconductor business, as stated in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), where they are described as foundational to mobile and wireless technologies. The financial risk of losing these OEMs is therefore directly tied to Qualcomm's core product offerings, creating a strategic tension between reliance on these customers and the threat they pose through vertical integration. This interplay underscores a complex dependency where Qualcomm's financial health is tied to customers who may become competitors in the integrated circuit space.",

Risk Factors\n\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' References to 'and,' 'or' and 'and/or' should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies - Concentrations.'\n\nIn addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand, elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), or a shift in share away",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

      "question": "How does Intel's development of high-end discrete GPUs, as a competitive threat outlined in AMD's risk factors, contrast with AMD's strategic positioning of discrete GPUs as a core product line within its Gaming segment, and what implications does this have for AMD's revenue and profitability?",
      "answer": "Intel's development of high-end discrete GPUs, as detailed in AMD's risk factors, poses a direct competitive threat by potentially limiting AMD's market access and pricing power. This concern is amplified by Intel's financial strength and ability to bundle products or offer preferential access to proprietary interfaces. In contrast, AMD positions discrete GPUs as a core component of its Gaming segment, which is one of its four reportable segments and a key revenue driver. AMD's 2023 segment reporting shows that the Gaming segment includes discrete GPUs and semi-custom SoC products, indicating strategic emphasis on this product category. The juxtaposition of these two perspectives suggests that while AMD is doubling down on discrete GPUs as a strategic growth lever, the intensifying competition from Intel could compress margins and hinder revenue growth in this critical segment, particularly if Intel leverages its platform dominance and OEM relationships aggressively.",

      "question": "How does Broadcom's valuation methodology for developed technology related to SoC controller products differ from the valuation assumptions used for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) developed technology, and what does this reveal about the strategic importance of VCF in Broadcom's post-acquisition integration plan?",
      "answer": "Broadcom used the relief-from-royalty method to value the developed technology for SoC controller products, applying a royalty rate to forecasted revenue with an economic useful life determined by the technology cycle and forecast period. In contrast, for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) developed technology, Broadcom applied the multi-period excess earnings method, which considers projected cash flows adjusted for contributory asset charges and technology obsolescence rates. This more complex valuation for VCF reflects its strategic importance in Broadcom's integration plan, as VCF is highlighted as a core component of the VMware acquisition valued at $24,156 million, with a significant portion attributed to VCF. The differing methodologies indicate that VCF is not just a revenue-generating asset but a foundational technology requiring detailed cash flow modeling, suggesting deeper integration into Broadcom\u2019s long-term software strategy.",

      "answer": "AMD faces export restrictions under the EAR that limit shipments of certain Versal\u2122 FPGAs to China and customers with ultimate parents in D5 countries, requiring either a license or a 25-day NAC notification. These controls could result in shipment prohibitions or delays, directly impacting AMD\u2019s ability to meet demand from hyperscale data center customers, especially those incorporating FPGAs into AI workloads like generative AI models. Given that FPGAs are a core component in AMD\u2019s data center product portfolio and are sold to both OEMs and ODMs serving these hyperscale clients, any disruption in exportability could hinder their competitive positioning and revenue potential in this growing segment.",

Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

      "answer": "Apple's Greater China segment reported robust financial performance in 2022 with $74.2 billion in net sales and $31.153 billion in operating income, showing a growing market presence. However, the Greater China segment includes China Mainland, where Apple has significant manufacturing and supply chain operations. The company's risk factors on page 9 highlight that China Mainland is a focal point for geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and public health issues like the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors could disrupt Apple's supply chain, increase costs through tariffs, and reduce consumer demand due to economic uncertainty. Therefore, while the Greater China region contributes significantly to Apple's profitability, its dependence on China Mainland introduces strategic vulnerabilities that could undermine the segment's growth and financial performance if geopolitical or operational risks materialize.",

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's vertical integration risk related to Samsung's development of its own integrated circuit products contrast with the strategic importance of Samsung as a major revenue contributor, particularly in light of Qualcomm's semiconductor business diversification efforts beyond mobile handsets?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm identifies Samsung as a major customer, with revenues from Samsung comprising 10% or more of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2022, underscoring its strategic importance as a key client. However, the company also highlights a material risk in its semiconductor business stemming from Samsung's vertical integration, as Samsung develops its own integrated circuit products for use in its devices rather than relying on Qualcomm's offerings. This dual characterization reveals a tension between Samsung's current role as a revenue driver and the potential erosion of that position as Samsung increasingly competes with Qualcomm in the integrated circuit space. This dynamic complicates Qualcomm's diversification strategy beyond mobile handsets into areas like automotive and IoT, where maintaining strong OEM relationships is critical to scaling new product adoption.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including, but not limited to, 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business, our cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\n## Revenue Concentrations and Significant Customers\n\nA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2022, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies' and 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the use of 5G, the expansion into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in modem, radio-frequency integrated circuit, RFFE, multimedia (camera, video, display and computer vision), sensor perception and drive policy, advanced SoC, which includes specialized engines such as CPU and GPU to enable high performance and low-power computing and other optimization techniques, AI, packaging and a broad range of other technologies. We expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and technologies and to utilize that research and development in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of new modem and multimedia technologies and other technologies (such as ADAS/AD and XR), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world.\n\nWe continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhance existing products and services) for voice and data communications and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as ADAS/AD. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, voice and music devices, wearable devices and XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.\n\nWe develop innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.",

      "question": "How does AMD's strategic positioning of FPGAs in hyperscale data centers align with the export licensing constraints imposed by EAR regulations on Versal\u2122 FPGAs destined for China?",
      "answer": "AMD positions FPGAs as critical components in hyperscale data centers, particularly for AI workloads such as generative AI models, and highlights their integration into servers sold by OEMs and ODMs to large public cloud service providers. However, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) now restrict the export of certain AMD Versal\u2122 FPGAs to China or to customers outside the U.S. with ultimate parents in D5 countries, including China, without a license. These restrictions not only limit AMD\u2019s ability to sell these products in key markets but also introduce uncertainty through the NAC notification process, which could delay or block shipments. Given the strategic importance of FPGAs in driving revenue from AI and cloud infrastructure, these export controls could materially impact AMD\u2019s competitive positioning and financial performance, especially if alternative products are not accepted or future regulations expand.",

Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

      "answer": "AMD faces potential financial penalties under the Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. if it fails to meet its annual wafer purchase targets through 2025, as disclosed in the risk factors section. These penalties are tied directly to the binding obligations outlined in Amendment No. 7 (May 12, 2021) and its First Amendment (December 23, 2021), which mandate minimum annual capacity allocations from GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. and corresponding purchase commitments from AMD. The contractual framework, referenced on page 97, reinforces the enforceability and specificity of these commitments, creating a dual exposure: AMD must prepay certain amounts for wafers in 2022 and 2023, yet risks financial penalties if demand falls short.

We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "answer": "AMD's 7.50% Senior Notes impose specific redemption terms and financial covenants on the company, which reflect constraints on its financial flexibility. These notes rank equally with the 2.125% Notes, indicating a shared senior unsecured status. However, the 2.125% Notes are treated differently in that their fair value is directly influenced by AMD's stock price of $146.14 as of December 23, 2021, due to their convertibility feature.

The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes was $312 million.\n\nPrior to August 15, 2022, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a 'make whole' premium (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture). Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.50% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the 7.50% Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.50% Notes.\n\n## Debt Covenants and Seniority\n\nThe  7.50%  Notes  require  the  Company  to  comply  with  certain  financial  covenants  and  a  number  of  restrictive covenants. The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank equally with the Company's existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of the Company's future subordinated debt. The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank junior to all of the  Company's  future  senior  secured  debt  to  the  extent  of  the  collateral  securing  such  debt  and  are  structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes\n\nThe Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nThe Company is party to a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), including a $50 million swingline sub-facility and a $75 million sublimit for letters of credit pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in June 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the base rate at the Company's option (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. As of December 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had $14 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n## Future Payments on Total Debt\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, the Company's future debt payment obligations were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard on October 13, 2023, was excluded from the internal control assessment because it represented less than 1% of Microsoft\u2019s total assets as of June 30, 2024, and 2% of total revenues for the year. Despite this relatively small contribution to Microsoft\u2019s consolidated financials, Activision Blizzard had a significant pre-existing financial relationship with Wells Fargo Bank, as evidenced by multiple indentures and supplemental indentures for senior notes due between 2026 and 2050. Microsoft itself also maintains a broader partnership with Wells Fargo, as seen in its own debt arrangements, including the use of Wells Fargo as trustee for Activision Blizzard\u2019s outstanding notes. This suggests that while Activision Blizzard\u2019s financial impact on Microsoft is limited, its existing financial infrastructure\u2014particularly its relationship with Wells Fargo\u2014remains relevant in Microsoft\u2019s broader capital structure and financing strategy.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's repeated use of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company as trustee in multiple supplemental indentures for specific debt instruments relate to the foundational terms established in the Base Indenture from May 18, 2009, and what does this imply about Microsoft's long-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft has consistently used The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company (BNY Mellon) as the trustee across multiple supplemental indentures for various debt instruments, including the 1.625% Notes due 2018, 3.625% Notes due 2023, and 4.875% Notes due 2043 (dated December 6, 2013), as well as later issuances such as the 1.100% Notes due 2019 and 3.950% Notes due 2056 (dated August 8, 2016). These supplemental indentures all reference the Base Indenture dated May 18, 2009, which establishes the core legal framework governing Microsoft\u2019s debt obligations. The repeated use of the same trustee and the consistent referencing of the Base Indenture suggest that Microsoft has institutionalized a standardized and centralized debt management structure. This implies a strategic preference for continuity, legal consistency, and administrative efficiency in managing long-term debt instruments across multiple decades of issuance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_105) \u2192 [BNY Mellon]: Microsoft has used BNY Mellon as trustee in multiple supplemental indentures for specific debt instruments issued between 2013 and 2016, including notes with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2056.",
        "Hop 2: [BNY Mellon] \u2192 [Base Indenture]: BNY Mellon\u2019s role as trustee is defined under the Base Indenture dated May 18, 2009, which serves as the foundational legal document for all subsequent supplemental indentures.",
        "Hop 3: [Base Indenture] \u2190 [MSFT](page_103): The Base Indenture is explicitly listed in Microsoft\u2019s filings as a core exhibit, indicating its foundational role in structuring Microsoft\u2019s debt obligations over time."

      "question": "How does the indefinite delay of the final foreign tax credit regulations through Notice 2023-80 impact Microsoft's effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024, and how does this compare to the tax benefits derived from earnings in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions?",
      "answer": "The indefinite delay of the final foreign tax credit regulations through Notice 2023-80 resulted in a tax benefit that contributed to a 1 percentage point decrease in Microsoft's effective tax rate from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 18% in fiscal year 2024. This benefit was part of broader tax law changes that allowed Microsoft to continue benefiting from earnings in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions, particularly Ireland, which accounted for 83% of foreign income before tax in fiscal year 2024. While the foreign regional operating center strategy remained a consistent driver of lower effective tax rates across both years, the regulatory delay provided additional near-term tax relief that would have otherwise been constrained under the original regulation timeline.",

        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_82) \u2192 [Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations]: Microsoft discusses how the delay of these regulations contributed to a lower effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024, specifically mentioning Notice 2023-80 as a key factor in the tax benefit.",
        "Hop 2: [Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations] \u2192 [Notice 2023-80]: Notice 2023-80 directly delayed the implementation of the Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations indefinitely, altering Microsoft\u2019s tax planning and compliance obligations.",
        "Hop 3: [Notice 2023-80] \u2190 [MSFT](page_47): The effective tax rate section confirms that Notice 2023-80 was a material contributor to the decrease in the effective tax rate, alongside the geographic distribution of earnings."

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 83% and 81% of our foreign income before tax. In fiscal year 2022, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2024, includes tax benefits from tax law changes. In fiscal year 2024, tax benefits from tax law changes primarily relates to the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely. In fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were no indiv idually significant other reconciling items.\n\nThe decrease in our effectiv e tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the delay of the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations. The increase in our effectiv e tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## Effective Tax Rate\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectiv ely. The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's continued use of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company as a trustee for multiple debt issuances, including the 4.20% Notes due 2019 and later instruments like the 3.950% Notes due 2056, reflect a long-term strategic relationship despite evolving debt structures and maturities?",
      "answer": "Microsoft has maintained a consistent relationship with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company (BNY Mellon) as trustee since at least 2009, as evidenced by the repeated use of the Base Indenture dated May 18, 2009, for various debt instruments including the 4.20% Notes due 2019 (First Supplemental Indenture, 2009) and the 3.950% Notes due 2056 (Eleventh Supplemental Indenture, 2016). This ongoing partnership suggests a strategic trust arrangement that supports Microsoft\u2019s evolving capital structure, enabling the company to issue debt across a wide range of maturities (from 2018 to 2056) while maintaining consistent legal and administrative oversight. The use of the same base indenture framework with BNY Mellon indicates operational continuity and regulatory reliability, despite changes in interest rate environments and investor demand over time.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's issuance of the 2.95% Notes due 2014 under the Base Indenture with BNY Mellon in 2009 established a foundational framework for subsequent debt issuances. This relationship continued through 2016, as evidenced by the Eighth Supplemental Indenture on page 105, which included new notes with maturities extending to 2043. The consistent use of BNY Mellon as trustee across these indentures indicates a strategic, long-standing partnership that supports Microsoft\u2019s broader capital structure and debt financing strategy over time.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was reduced primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the delay of the final foreign tax credit regulations through Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80. These notices postponed the effective date of the regulations to fiscal year 2024 and then indefinitely. This delay allowed Microsoft to maintain a lower effective tax rate (18% in fiscal year 2024 compared to 19% in fiscal year 2023) by deferring potential tax liabilities associated with the foreign tax credit rules. If these regulations are ultimately implemented, Microsoft may face a higher effective tax rate in future periods as the tax benefits from the delay are reversed, potentially impacting profitability and cash flow.",

The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance.

      "question": "How does AMD's strategy of retiring the 7.50% Senior Notes compare with the financial implications of converting the 2.125% Notes, particularly in light of the $15 million excess if-converted value of the 2.125% Notes over their principal amount?",
      "answer": "AMD may retire the 7.50% Senior Notes through redemption or repurchase under favorable market conditions, as outlined in the Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes section. In contrast, the 2.125% Notes have already seen partial conversion in 2021, resulting in a $7 million loss and leaving only $1 million in outstanding principal. The if-converted value of the remaining 2.125% Notes exceeded their principal by $15 million as of December 23, 2021, indicating a potential equity dilution cost if further conversions occur. This highlights a strategic trade-off between managing near-term debt obligations (7.50% Notes maturing in 2022) and longer-term equity impacts from convertible debt (2.125% Notes).",

The 2.125% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The interest  is  payable  semi-annually  in  March  and  September  of  each  year,  commencing in March 2017. During 2021, holders of the 2.125% Notes converted $25 million principal amount of notes in exchange for approximately 3 million shares of the Company's common stock at the conversion price of $8.00 per share. The Company recorded a loss of $7 million from these conversions in Other income (expense), net on its consolidated statements of operations. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2.125% Notes was $1 million.\n\nThe Company's current intent is to deliver shares of its common stock upon conversion of the 2.125% Notes. As such, no sinking  fund  is  provided  for  the  2.125%  Notes  and  the  Company  continued  to  classify  the  carrying  value  of  the liability  component  of  the  2.125%  Notes  as  long-term  debt  and  the  equity  component  of  the  2.125%  Notes  as permanent equity on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2021. The determination of whether or not the 2.125% Notes are convertible is performed on a calendar-quarter basis.\n\nBased on the closing price of the Company's common stock of $146.14 on December 23, 2021, the last trading day of 2021, the if-converted value of the 2.125% Notes exceeded its principal amount by approximately $15 million.\n\nThe effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes is 8%. This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated conversion features.\n\nThe  following  table  sets  forth  total  interest  expense  recognized  related  to  the  2.125%  Notes  for  the  year  ended December 25, 2021:\n\n",

      "answer": "Microsoft's Server products and cloud services revenue grew from $79.97B in FY23 to $97.726B in FY24, representing a 22.2% year-over-year increase. This growth is directly tied to the strategic positioning of Windows Server as hybrid cloud infrastructure, as stated in the segment description where Server products are explicitly included in the Intelligent Cloud segment that powers modern business and developers. The technical capabilities of Windows Server as on-premises infrastructure that integrates with Azure cloud services (as described in the Server Products and Cloud Services section) enable enterprises to maintain hybrid environments.

      "question": "How does Microsoft's competitive positioning against Meta in the productivity software space align with its OEM distribution strategy for Office, particularly considering the inclusion of Office in pre-installed device software?",
      "answer": "Microsoft identifies Meta as a competitor in the productivity software space (specifically for Office), noting that it competes by offering 'powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools.' At the same time, Microsoft strategically distributes Office through OEMs who pre-install it on new devices, alongside Windows. This pre-installation ensures broad user exposure and adoption of Office, which is critical in maintaining its competitive edge against rivals like Meta. The OEM strategy reinforces Microsoft\u2019s ability to integrate Office into the user's initial device experience, creating a structural advantage in the productivity market despite Meta's competitive presence.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\n## Item 1\n\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of highquality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming  services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "answer": "The 33% year-over-year growth in Server products and cloud services\u2014from $67.35B in 2022 to $97.726B in 2024\u2014demonstrates strong momentum in Microsoft's cloud and infrastructure offerings. Within this segment, Visual Studio is explicitly listed alongside core cloud services like Azure and server software such as SQL Server and Windows Server. This inclusion indicates that Microsoft views developer tools like Visual Studio not just as standalone software products, but as integral components of its broader cloud and enterprise strategy. By grouping Visual Studio with cloud infrastructure and server platforms, Microsoft aligns its development ecosystem with its cloud growth engine, reinforcing a unified approach where developer productivity tools directly support cloud adoption and hybrid IT environments. This strategic bundling suggests that Visual Studio plays a pivotal role in enabling developers to build and deploy applications on Azure, thereby driving sustained usage and monetization of Microsoft\u2019s cloud infrastructure.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

      "answer": "The allowance for credit losses on loan receivables decreased from $103 million in fiscal year 2022 to $53 million in fiscal year 2023, a reduction of $50 million. This decrease suggests improved credit quality or a strategic reduction in risk exposure. Loan receivables are used to finance the sale of Cisco's services, including Advanced Services, which implies that the company may have become more selective or experienced better repayment performance in financing service offerings. This aligns with Cisco's use of financing tools to support the sale of services, indicating a potential strengthening of credit management in that segment.",

The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.

      "question": "How does Microsoft's treatment of Software Assurance (SA) in multi-year Enterprise Agreements affect the timing of revenue recognition for on-premises licenses compared to the invoicing terms outlined in the contracts?",
      "answer": "Microsoft includes Software Assurance (SA) in Enterprise Agreements, which are multi-year licensing programs designed for medium or large organizations. These agreements allow customers to purchase perpetual or subscription-based licenses over a three-year period. SA, which provides benefits like future software upgrades, is bundled with perpetual licenses in Enterprise Agreements. According to the accounting policy on page 64, revenue for multi-year on-premises licenses is recognized upfront even though invoicing occurs annually at the beginning of each coverage period. This creates a timing difference between when revenue is recognized and when cash is collected, resulting in recorded receivables. The upfront recognition reflects Microsoft's assessment of the standalone selling price (SSP) and the pattern of delivery of SA benefits across the customer portfolio. Thus, while invoicing is annual, revenue recognition is immediate, and SA plays a key role in structuring the customer relationship and determining the allocation of variable consideration.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

License fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licenseeby-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is ex ecuted and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement. If all such conditions are not met, revenues and any associated receivables are generally not recognized until such time that the required conditions are met. Cash collected from customers prior to a contract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting, underpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items, evaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees' conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other items, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are newly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues have been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and enforceable right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\n\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\n\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable, net (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied",

          "chunk_text": "agreements contain binding renewal provisions which provide that if the parties are unable to agree upon the terms and conditions of a new license agreement by a specified date, either party may initiate binding arbitration proceedings to establish such terms and conditions, which would become effective immediately after the expiration of the prior agreement. Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

          "chunk_text": "products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

      "answer": "Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from Greater China in 2022, a region that includes Taiwan. According to the segment reporting, Taiwan is a key component of Apple's operations in the region. However, in the risk factors section, Apple highlights that its supply chain, particularly in Asia, is vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, including those involving Taiwan. The company also notes that a significant portion of its manufacturing is outsourced to partners in Asia, including Taiwan, making it susceptible to disruptions from political instability, trade restrictions, and other international conflicts. Therefore, while Taiwan contributes to Apple's revenue performance within Greater China, it also represents a critical risk point due to its strategic location and the current geopolitical climate.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "question": "How does AMD's binding wafer purchase commitment with GLOBALFOUNDRIES under the 2021 Amendment affect its exposure to inventory risk, given the lack of long-term commitment contracts with other third-party manufacturers?",
      "answer": "AMD's binding wafer purchase commitments under the 2021 Amendment with GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. require AMD to meet annual purchase targets through 2025 or face financial penalties, and also obligate AMD to pre-pay certain amounts in 2022 and 2023. This creates a significant inventory risk if actual demand falls short of these targets. In contrast, AMD lacks long-term commitment contracts with other third-party manufacturers and instead relies on purchase orders, which means those suppliers are not obligated to meet AMD's capacity needs. This dual situation increases AMD's exposure to inventory risk with GLOBALFOUNDRIES while leaving it vulnerable to supply shortages from other manufacturers, creating a complex risk trade-off in supply chain management.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's reliance on Chinese OEMs for a significant portion of its licensing revenues reconcile with the risk that these same OEMs may develop their own integrated circuit products, potentially undermining Qualcomm's semiconductor business and revenue diversification strategy?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm reports that it derives a significant portion of its licensing revenues from Chinese OEMs, which are central to its financial performance. However, the company also acknowledges that these OEMs may develop their own integrated circuit products due to pressures such as China\u2019s Made in China 2025 campaign, trade tensions, or supply chain concerns. This vertical integration could reduce Qualcomm's semiconductor sales, particularly in a market where the company is already facing competition and customer diversification risks. The contradiction between depending on Chinese OEMs for licensing revenue while facing potential erosion of semiconductor sales from their self-developed products creates a strategic tension that could impact Qualcomm\u2019s ability to sustain its current revenue model and diversification efforts.",

Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to those described in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in 'Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and 2021. Discussions of fiscal 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2021.\n\n## Our Business and Operating Segments\n\nWe develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\nFurther information regarding our business and operating segments is provided in 'Part I, Item 1.

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.

Risk Factors\n\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' References to 'and,' 'or' and 'and/or' should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies - Concentrations.'\n\nIn addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand, elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), or a shift in share away",

      "question": "Given Microsoft's description of Enterprise Support Services as key enablers for deploying hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, how does the multi-year revenue trend of Enterprise and Partner Services in the Intelligent Cloud segment reflect their strategic importance relative to Azure's growth trajectory?",
      "answer": "Microsoft describes Enterprise Support Services as part of a broader suite of Enterprise and Partner Services that assist customers in deploying hybrid cloud solutions and AI capabilities, positioning them as critical to leveraging Microsoft's cloud infrastructure. However, while Azure and broader Intelligent Cloud revenue have grown significantly\u2014Azure revenue alone increased from $67.35 billion in 2022 to $97.726 billion in 2024\u2014Enterprise and Partner Services revenue declined slightly from $7,605 million in 2022 to $7,594 million in 2024. This divergence suggests that while Microsoft emphasizes the strategic importance of these services in enabling customer success with cloud and AI, the financial performance indicates they have not scaled at the same pace as the underlying cloud infrastructure, potentially signaling a need for realignment or investment to better capture value from this service offering.",

      "answer": "Cisco issued $13.5 billion in senior fixed-rate notes in February 2024, which ranks at par with the $10.9 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 27, 2024. These two debt instruments are part of Cisco\u2019s broader capital structure and financing strategy. The company also entered into an interest rate swap for $0.5 billion of the senior fixed-rate notes, converting fixed interest payments to floating rates based on SOFR, indicating an active approach to managing interest rate exposure. This hedging activity suggests that while the senior notes are fixed-rate in nature, Cisco is mitigating potential interest rate risk, which contrasts with the inherently short-term and flexible nature of the commercial paper notes.

This continuity in trustee relationships likely supports streamlined debt issuance, regulatory compliance, and investor confidence. The long-standing nature of this relationship, first established in the Base Indenture of May 18, 2009, and extended through multiple note issuances, suggests Microsoft prioritizes institutional familiarity and reliability in its capital markets activities.

      "answer": "Qualcomm sees on-device generative AI as a key growth driver, projecting that a growing percentage of smartphones will become generative AI-capable in the coming years. While these AI models are primarily developed for cloud deployment, Qualcomm emphasizes the benefits of running them on edge devices\u2014such as lower latency, improved privacy, and personalized experiences. This aligns with their broader strategy of distributing complex workloads between the cloud and edge devices. At the same time, Qualcomm is actively investing in cloud computing through its nonreportable cloud computing processing initiative, indicating a strategic effort to support both ends of the AI processing spectrum. By advancing both on-device AI capabilities and cloud infrastructure, Qualcomm is positioning itself to enable a coordinated ecosystem where edge devices can intelligently interact with cloud-based applications as needed, enhancing productivity and user experience.",

We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases.

      "answer": "Intel signed an agreement with SK hynix in October 2020 to divest its NAND memory business, including the Fab Assets in Dalian, China, and the NAND SSD Business. The first closing occurred on December 29, 2021, where these assets and the NAND SSD Business were transferred to SK hynix. Despite this divestiture, Intel entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, under which Intel continues to manufacture NAND memory wafers using the Dalian Fab Assets for SK hynix until the second closing. This ongoing manufacturing relationship supports SK hynix\u2019s use of the Fab Assets while Intel benefits from continued revenue through this agreement. In the NSG segment overview, it is noted that NAND profitability improved in 2021 due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant, and equipment held for sale. This profitability improvement aligns with the strategic divestiture, while Intel continues to leverage its NAND technology through product launches such as the Intel SSD D5-P5316, based on 144-layer QLC NAND. Thus, the divestiture of Fab Assets supports Intel\u2019s strategic refocus while maintaining a transitional revenue stream and supporting product innovation through its NAND technology roadmap.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's QSI segment is explicitly investing in XR as part of its broader strategy to expand opportunities for its technologies, including through non-marketable equity investments in early-stage companies (QSI Segment, page_13). The company positions XR as a key beneficiary of 5G's capabilities, noting that immersive applications like XR require 5G's 'multi-gigabit data rates' and 'low latency' to deliver 'ultra-high definition video streaming,' 'cloud gaming,' and 'immersive experiences' (page_7). However, the company also acknowledges in its risk factors that its growth depends on successfully extending technologies into new areas like XR, and that these initiatives may not generate the expected operating income (page_4). This creates a three-hop alignment: Qualcomm is investing in XR (QSI Segment), which is technologically dependent on 5G (XR \u2192 5G), but the company warns that new initiatives may not yield expected returns (5G risk). Therefore, the success of Qualcomm's XR investments is inherently tied to the uncertain adoption and commercialization of 5G, which the company itself identifies as a material risk to its business strategy.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "answer": "Intel's NAND wafer manufacturing agreement with SK hynix was a strategic component of the broader divestiture of its NAND memory business, allowing for continued production and revenue generation during the transition period. The agreement ensured manufacturing continuity using the Dalian fab assets until the second closing of the divestiture, which helped Intel maintain product availability and customer relationships while exiting the business. This arrangement likely supported the profitability improvements noted in 2021, which were attributed to the absence of depreciation expenses on NAND assets held for sale. By retaining manufacturing capabilities temporarily through the agreement, Intel could manage the transition more effectively, ensuring a smoother handover to SK hynix while still benefiting from the operational efficiencies and cost controls that contributed to improved financial performance.",

NSG is disrupting the memory and storage hierarchy with new tiers that balance capacity, performance, and cost. Our products are available in innovative form factors and densities to address the memory and storage challenges our customers face in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience. Put simply, in today's data-driven world, advances in both data center and client computing need to be matched by cutting-edge innovation in the memoryand-storage space.\"\n\n-Rob Crooke, NSG General Manager\n\n## 5-Year Trends",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's use of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as a trustee for Activision Blizzard's debt instruments relate to the exclusion of Activision Blizzard's internal controls from Microsoft's assessment of financial reporting effectiveness following the acquisition on October 13, 2023?",
      "answer": "Microsoft engaged Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as trustee for Activision Blizzard's debt instruments, including the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 and 2027, among others, prior to the acquisition. After acquiring Activision Blizzard on October 13, 2023, Microsoft excluded Activision Blizzard's internal controls from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, noting that Activision represented less than 1% of Microsoft\u2019s total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and 2% of total revenues as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024. This raises the question of how the prior reliance on Wells Fargo as a trustee for Activision\u2019s debt aligns with Microsoft\u2019s current control framework, especially given that Activision\u2019s internal controls were not integrated into Microsoft\u2019s evaluation despite its inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.",

        "Hop 2: [Wells Fargo Bank, National Association] \u2192 [Activision Blizzard, Inc.]: Wells Fargo served as trustee for Activision Blizzard\u2019s debt, suggesting a formal financial governance structure was in place for Activision prior to Microsoft\u2019s acquisition.",

      "question": "Given Apple's strong revenue contribution from Greater China in 2022, how does the company's operational exposure to China Mainland, particularly in the context of geopolitical and public health risks, affect its risk-adjusted profitability outlook?",
      "answer": "Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from Greater China in 2022, with $31.153 billion in operating income, underscoring the region's significant contribution to the company\u2019s financial performance. Greater China, which includes China Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, is a critical market for Apple. However, the company's operations are exposed to China Mainland in multiple ways, including manufacturing and supply chain dependencies. As noted in the risk factors section, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, including tariffs and trade restrictions, can increase production costs and reduce gross margins. Additionally, public health risks like the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can disrupt supply chains and reduce consumer demand. These risks, concentrated in China Mainland, heighten the vulnerability of Apple\u2019s profitability and operational efficiency, despite the region\u2019s current revenue contributions. Therefore, while Greater China remains a growth driver, the underlying risks tied to China Mainland present a material challenge to Apple\u2019s risk-adjusted profitability outlook.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's ongoing use of The Bank of New York Mellon as trustee across multiple supplemental indentures, including those governing the 4.20% Notes due 2019, reflect a consistent debt issuance strategy and trustee relationship management approach?",
      "answer": "Microsoft has maintained a consistent relationship with The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) as trustee across multiple debt issuances, as evidenced by the repeated use of BNY Mellon in indentures dating from 2009 through 2016. Specifically, the 4.20% Notes due 2019 are governed under the First Supplemental Indenture dated May 18, 2009, between Microsoft and BNY Mellon. This foundational relationship was extended through subsequent supplemental indentures (e.g., Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Supplemental Indentures) covering various note issuances, including those in 2013, 2015, and 2016. The consistent use of BNY Mellon as trustee across these different debt instruments and time periods suggests a strategic decision to maintain continuity, trust, and operational efficiency in Microsoft\u2019s debt governance and issuance framework.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's ongoing relationship with BNY Mellon as trustee for multiple note issuances, including the 5.20% Notes due 2039, reflect its broader capital structure management strategy across different debt instruments?",
      "answer": "Microsoft has consistently engaged BNY Mellon as trustee across multiple debt issuances, including the 5.20% Notes due 2039, as evidenced by the repeated appearance of BNY Mellon in various supplemental indentures dating back to 2009. This long-standing relationship, documented in filings related to notes with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2056, indicates a deliberate and consistent approach to debt governance. The inclusion of the 5.20% Notes due 2039 within this framework highlights Microsoft's use of long-dated instruments to support long-term capital commitments. The repeated use of the same base indenture and trustee across different interest rate environments and maturity profiles suggests a centralized, standardized approach to managing corporate debt obligations.",

      "answer": "Microsoft redeemed $985 million of Nuance's convertible senior notes prior to June 30, 2022, leaving only $1 million outstanding. This redemption reflects a significant financial step in Microsoft's post-acquisition management of Nuance's liabilities. The company attributes the goodwill assigned to the Intelligent Cloud segment to increased synergies expected from the integration of Nuance. This indicates that the redemption of the notes was part of a broader integration strategy aimed at aligning Nuance\u2019s financial structure with Microsoft\u2019s long-term operational goals, particularly within the Intelligent Cloud segment, where Nuance contributes through server products and cloud services as well as professional services.",

Our competitors continue to develop and deploy cloud-based serv ices for consumers and business customers, and pricing and deliv ery models are ev olv ing. We and our competitors are dev oting significant resources to dev elop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.\n- We are inv esting in artificial intelligence ('AI') across the entire company and infusing generativ e AI capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and serv ices to be a highly competitiv e and rapidly ev olv ing market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will bear significant dev elopment and operational costs to build and support the AI models, serv ices, platforms, and infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectiv ely we must also be responsiv e to technological change, new and potential regulatory dev elopments, and public scrutiny.\n- Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-serv ice business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software rev enue. We bear the costs of conv erting original ideas into software products through inv estments in research and dev elopment, offsetting these costs with the rev enue receiv ed from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also dev elop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n- Other competitors dev elop and offer free applications, online serv ices, and content, and make money by selling third-party adv ertising. Advertising rev enue funds dev elopment of products and serv ices these competitors prov ide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our rev enue-generating products.\n- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source AI models, and earning rev enue on adv ertising or integrated products and serv ices. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitiv e pressures described abov e may cause decreased sales v olumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and dev elopment, marketing, and sales incentiv es, which may adv ersely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing and AI serv ices. These costs will reduce the operating margins. Whether we succeed in cloud-based and AI serv ices depends on our execution in sev eral areas, including:\n\n- Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and AI experiences and products that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n- Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and AI serv ices on the growing array of computing dev ices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other dev ices.\n- Continuing to enhance the attractiv eness of our cloud platforms to third-party dev elopers.\n- Ensuring our cloud-based serv ices meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n- Making our suite of cloud-based serv ices platform-agnostic, av ailable on a wide range of dev ices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will continue to attract users or generate the rev enue required to succeed. If we are not effectiv e in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innov ation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and serv ices, we may not grow rev enue in line with the infrastructure and dev elopment inv estments described abov e.

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's strategic investment in XR, as disclosed in their QSI segment on page 13, reflects a forward-looking effort to expand opportunities for their technologies in immersive applications like augmented and virtual reality. These applications are heavily dependent on 5G's capabilities \u2014 such as multi-gigabit data rates, low latency, and high network capacity \u2014 which are essential for delivering seamless XR experiences. However, on page 5, Qualcomm outlines several risks tied to the adoption and commercialization of 5G, including regulatory hurdles, intense industry competition, and the cyclical nature of semiconductor demand. These risks imply that if 5G deployment lags or if market adoption of 5G-enabled devices slows, Qualcomm\u2019s investment in XR may not yield the anticipated returns. Therefore, while XR represents a growth vector enabled by 5G, it is also a point of exposure to the broader uncertainties Qualcomm faces in the 5G ecosystem.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's exclusion of Activision Blizzard's internal controls from its assessment relate to the integration of Activision's 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 into Microsoft's debt structure following the October 2023 acquisition?",
      "answer": "Microsoft excluded Activision Blizzard's internal controls from its assessment because the acquisition occurred on October 13, 2023, and Activision's financial statements represented less than 1% of Microsoft's total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and 2% of total revenues as of June 30, 2024. Despite this exclusion, Activision's 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 were integrated into Microsoft's broader debt structure, as evidenced by the November 6, 2023 filing of the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, which formally incorporated these notes under Microsoft\u2019s existing debt framework. This indicates that while Activision\u2019s internal controls were not assessed, its debt obligations were operationally and structurally assumed by Microsoft post-acquisition.",

        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_99) \u2192 [Activision Blizzard, Inc.]: Microsoft excluded Activision Blizzard from its internal control assessment due to the October 13, 2023 acquisition and its relatively small contribution (less than 1% of assets and 2% of revenues).",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total rev enues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiv eness of internal control ov er financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control ov er financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and ev aluating the design and operating effectiv eness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believ e that our audit prov ides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control ov er financial reporting is a process designed to prov ide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

      "answer": "Cisco provides technical support services as part of its financing arrangements, which include loan receivables that typically span one to three years (page 49 and 82). These loan receivables are subject to credit risk, which is reflected in the credit loss allowance disclosed in the financial statements. In fiscal 2023, the credit loss allowance for loan receivables decreased from $103 million to $53 million, indicating a reduction in the estimated risk associated with these financing activities (page 84). This suggests that the company's exposure to credit losses from financing technical support services through loans has declined year-over-year, potentially reflecting improved credit quality of customers or more conservative underwriting in loan origination.",

      "answer": "Microsoft issued the 5.20% Notes due 2039 under a First Supplemental Indenture dated May 18, 2009, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (BNY Mellon) as trustee. This is part of a broader capital structure strategy involving multiple long-term debt instruments, including notes due in 2018, 2023, 2035, 2045, and 2055, some of which are also administered by BNY Mellon and later by U.S. Bank National Association. The repeated use of these trustees across different maturities suggests Microsoft's structured approach to managing long-term liabilities through trusted financial institutions, balancing interest rate risk and maturity laddering to maintain financial flexibility.",

        "Hop 2: [5.20% Notes due 2039] \u2192 [BNY Mellon]: BNY Mellon serves as trustee for these notes, indicating its regulatory role in administering the debt issuance.",

      "question": "With Greater China contributing $74.2 billion in net sales in 2022, how exposed is Apple to operational risks in Taiwan, particularly regarding supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions?",
      "answer": "Apple's Greater China segment generated $74.2 billion in net sales and $31.153 billion in operating income in 2022, making it a significant contributor to the company's financial performance. Greater China includes Taiwan, which is a key location in Apple's supply chain and manufacturing operations. According to the risk factors outlined in the 10-K, Apple is exposed to various operational risks in Taiwan, including supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. These risks could materially impact Apple's ability to manufacture and deliver products efficiently, affecting both profitability and revenue. Given that Taiwan is part of the Greater China segment and plays a critical role in Apple's global supply chain, any disruptions in Taiwan could directly affect the region's financial contribution, especially since Apple relies on a concentrated set of manufacturing partners in Asia. Thus, despite the strong financial performance of Greater China in 2022, Apple remains significantly exposed to operational risks in Taiwan.",

Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

      "answer": "Broadcom applied different valuation methodologies to developed technology depending on its application context. For VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), Broadcom used the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, valuing it at $24,156 million, with a significant portion attributed to VCF. This method reflects the present value of projected cash flows less charges representing contributions of other assets. In contrast, for SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications, Broadcom used the relief-from-royalty method, which applies a royalty rate to forecasted revenue. This difference in approach reflects the distinct nature of the technologies\u2014software-based cloud infrastructure (VCF) versus hardware controller products\u2014and how each contributes to cash flows. The economic useful life for both was determined based on technology cycles and forecasted cash flows, but the underlying assumptions and modeling techniques differ significantly.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's OEM distribution strategy for Office relate to its competitive positioning against Meta in the productivity and collaboration software market, given Meta's presence in adjacent digital platforms that could encroach on enterprise productivity tools?",
      "answer": "Microsoft leverages its broad OEM distribution network, which includes major partners like Dell, HP, and Lenovo, to pre-install Office on new devices, ensuring widespread adoption and integration into enterprise workflows. This distribution model strengthens Office's entrenched position in the productivity software market, which directly competes with offerings from Meta and other tech companies. Meta is mentioned as a competitor to Office due to its growing presence in digital collaboration and communication platforms, particularly through social and messaging tools that could serve as informal productivity hubs. Meanwhile, Microsoft's broader product and service development strategy, led by the 'Experiences and Devices' engineering group, includes Office as a central component in its end-user experiences, reinforcing its differentiation against Meta. Thus, the OEM-driven reach of Office, combined with Microsoft's integrated product development approach, forms a key part of its competitive defense against Meta's expansion into adjacent productivity domains.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming  services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

This recurring use of BNY Mellon indicates a strategic preference for continuity and trust in managing its debt obligations. The 2.95% Notes due 2014, issued under the Base Indenture dated May 18, 2009, were part of a broader framework that allowed Microsoft to issue subsequent notes with varying terms, demonstrating a structured and scalable approach to debt financing.

      "answer": "Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment emphasizes System Center as a core component of its enterprise server and cloud infrastructure offerings, positioning it as a key enabler for IT productivity and system efficiency. This strategic positioning aligns with the 35% year-over-year revenue growth in Server products and cloud services (from $67.35B in 2022 to $79.97B in 2023 and $97.73B in 2024), suggesting strong demand for enterprise-grade management tools. The financial reporting on page 42 explicitly includes System Center in the Server products and cloud services revenue definition, reinforcing its integration into the broader cloud services narrative. This indicates that Microsoft views System Center not just as a standalone product, but as a critical part of its hybrid cloud strategy that supports both on-premises and cloud-based enterprise environments.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's exclusion of Activision Blizzard's internal controls from its financial reporting assessment relate to Activision's debt obligations under indentures administered by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association?",
      "answer": "Microsoft excluded Activision Blizzard's internal controls from its financial reporting assessment because Activision was acquired on October 13, 2023, and its financial statements represent less than 1% of Microsoft's total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles) and 2% of total revenues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Meanwhile, Activision has multiple debt obligations, including 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 and 2027, 1.350% Senior Notes due 2030, and 4.500% and 2.500% Senior Notes due in 2047 and 2050, respectively, all under indentures administered by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. This raises questions about how Microsoft's limited integration of Activision's financial controls aligns with its broader financial obligations and governance over entities that remain under third-party trustee oversight.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total rev enues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiv eness of internal control ov er financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control ov er financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control ov er financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and ev aluating the design and operating effectiv eness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believ e that our audit prov ides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control ov er financial reporting is a process designed to prov ide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control ov er financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) prov ide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) prov ide reasonable assurance regarding prev ention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could hav e a material effect on the financial statements.",

      "answer": "The credit loss allowance for loan receivables decreased from $103 million in fiscal year 2022 to $53 million in fiscal year 2023, indicating a reduction in expected credit losses. This trend suggests either improved credit quality of borrowers or more effective risk management practices. Since loan receivables are tied to the sale of hardware, software, and services\u2014including technical support services\u2014with average terms of one to three years, the decline in allowances may reflect increased confidence in the repayment capacity of customers purchasing these services. However, the inherent risk in financing technical support services\u2014often recurring and dependent on customer retention\u2014may not be fully captured by the allowance, highlighting a potential gap between quantitative provisioning and qualitative risk exposure.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's generative AI strategy for edge devices align with its cloud computing processing initiative, based on the company's segment reporting and resource allocation approach?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's generative AI strategy focuses on enabling complex large generative AI algorithms to run on edge devices like smartphones and PCs, with the expectation that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024. This aligns with their vision of distributing complex workloads between the edge and the cloud to optimize performance, privacy, and personalization. While generative AI models are primarily developed for use in the cloud, Qualcomm emphasizes the importance of on-device execution for immediacy and efficiency. This edge-focused AI strategy complements their cloud computing processing initiative, which is listed as a nonreportable segment under their organizational structure. Given that Qualcomm's Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates performance and allocates resources based on revenues and earnings before income taxes (EBT), and considering that both initiatives fall under the broader umbrella of advanced computing and connectivity technologies, it appears Qualcomm is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the interplay between edge AI and cloud computing. This coordinated approach suggests that Qualcomm views both areas as complementary components of its long-term growth strategy in high-performance, low-power computing technologies.",

Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices.

To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

      "answer": "Intel's decision to divest its NAND SSD Business and Fab Assets to SK hynix while retaining the ability to manufacture NAND memory wafers for them until the second closing reflects a strategic pivot. Despite this divestiture, Intel continued to innovate in NAND SSDs by launching the Intel SSD D5-P5316, a 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for data centers with up to 30.72TB capacity in multiple form factors. This indicates that Intel aimed to remain technologically competitive in NAND SSD development even as it transitioned the business to SK hynix.

However, Samsung is also developing its own integrated circuit products, which it increasingly uses in its devices instead of Qualcomm's offerings, potentially threatening Qualcomm's revenue stream. This risk is compounded by Qualcomm's significant financial commitments to integrated circuit production, including $12.8 billion in total inventory obligations as of September 29, 2024, with $9.6 billion expected to be paid within the next 12 months. These commitments include multi-year capacity purchase agreements that are difficult to cancel without financial penalties, making Qualcomm particularly vulnerable to shifts in customer behavior such as Samsung's vertical integration.

          "chunk_text": "products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was nine years and eight years, respectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $184 million, $204 million and $207 million, respectively. At September 29, 2024, other assets included $719 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $708 million recorded in other liabilities. At September 24, 2023, other assets included $612 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $571 million recorded in other liabilities.\n\nAt September 29, 2024, future lease payments under our operating leases were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Microsoft's long-standing relationship with BNY Mellon, dating back to the Base Indenture in 2009 and extended through multiple Supplemental Indentures including the one governing the 3.00% Notes due 2020, demonstrates a consistent and strategic approach to debt management. The repeated use of BNY Mellon across multiple note issuances\u2014such as the 3.00% Notes due 2020 (governed under the Second Supplemental Indenture dated 2010) and later issuances like the 3.625% Notes due 2023 and 4.875% Notes due 2043 (under the Eighth Supplemental Indenture in 2013)\u2014shows a preference for institutional continuity and trust. This pattern suggests Microsoft prioritizes stability, legal consistency, and trusted custodianship in managing its debt structure, which may reduce operational and legal risk while streamlining compliance and investor relations.",

        "Hop 2: [3.00% Notes due 2020] \u2192 [BNY Mellon]: BNY Mellon acts as trustee for these notes, regulating their terms and compliance under the indenture framework.",

      "answer": "Apple relies heavily on manufacturing partners in Taiwan, which is part of the Greater China segment, and faces risks such as tariffs and trade disputes that could increase product costs and reduce gross margins. Despite these risks, the Greater China segment reported $74.2 billion in net sales and $31.153 billion in operating income in 2022, indicating strong financial performance. This suggests that while Taiwan-based operations are exposed to geopolitical and trade-related risks, they remain a significant contributor to the company's profitability in the region.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does Cisco's lower gross margin from Advanced Services relate to the credit loss allowance reductions observed in their loan receivables portfolio?",
      "answer": "Cisco's Advanced Services are noted to carry a lower gross margin compared to technical support services, which impacts the company's overall profitability from services. These services are also explicitly tied to financing arrangements, including loan receivables, which are used to support customer purchases of Cisco products and services. On the other hand, the credit loss allowance for loan receivables decreased from $103 million in fiscal year 2022 to $53 million in fiscal year 2023, indicating improved credit quality or reduced risk in the loan portfolio. This reduction in credit loss allowances could imply stronger collections or lower defaults in the financing of Advanced Services, which may help offset some of the margin pressures seen in that service line. Therefore, while Advanced Services contribute less to gross margin, the improved credit performance of loan receivables tied to these services may positively impact Cisco\u2019s financial position.",

      "answer": "Cisco discloses that its senior fixed-rate notes, totaling $20.3 billion in principal, have a fair value sensitivity of $0.7 billion for a 50 BPS interest rate movement. These notes are ranked equally with the commercial paper notes issued under Cisco's $15.0 billion short-term debt program. While the senior notes are primarily fixed-rate, the commercial paper notes expose Cisco to variable interest costs, meaning a rise in rates could increase interest expense on new issuances.

NSG is disrupting the memory and storage hierarchy with new tiers that balance capacity, performance, and cost. Our products are available in innovative form factors and densities to address the memory and storage challenges our customers face in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience.

      "answer": "The allowance for credit losses on loan receivables decreased from $103 million in fiscal year 2022 to $53 million in fiscal year 2023, reflecting a net reduction of $50 million. This significant drop suggests an improvement in the expected credit quality of the loan receivables portfolio, which is directly tied to Cisco's financing arrangements for hardware sales. Given that loan receivables typically have terms of one to three years, this change may indicate either tighter credit controls or improved customer payment behavior. Additionally, since lease receivables are typically collateralized by the underlying hardware, the lower allowance may also reflect increased confidence in recoverability through asset repossession. This shift could signal a more aggressive or confident financing strategy for hardware sales in the near term.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's inclusion of Software Assurance (SA) in Enterprise Agreements relate to the revenue recognition challenges described in the contract balances section, particularly regarding unearned revenue from volume licensing programs?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's Enterprise Agreements include Software Assurance (SA), which is a key component of their volume licensing programs aimed at medium and large organizations over a three-year period. SA is bundled with perpetual licenses or subscriptions under these agreements, contributing to unearned revenue that is invoiced annually and recognized ratably over the coverage period. However, the company notes that due to the nature and benefits of the SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of benefits across the customer portfolio. This complicates revenue recognition, as SA is not sold separately, and its standalone selling price (SSP) must be estimated using available market and customer data. The unearned revenue from SA and cloud services under volume licensing programs is therefore subject to variability based on customer behavior and contract terms, making it a significant consideration in Microsoft's financial reporting.",

        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_19) \u2192 [Enterprise Agreement]: Microsoft introduces the Enterprise Agreement as a volume licensing program for large organizations, under which Software Assurance (SA) is included.",

We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

      "question": "How does Cisco's issuance of $0.6 billion in commercial paper notes relate to its $9.0 billion in senior fixed-rate notes, particularly in light of the interest rate sensitivity of the fixed-rate debt and the company's broader debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "Cisco's short-term commercial paper program, with $0.6 billion outstanding as of July 30, 2022, serves as a flexible source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. This short-term debt sits alongside $9.0 billion in senior fixed-rate notes, which carry a carrying value of $8.9 billion and a fair value of $9.7 billion as of the same date. The company has also entered into interest rate swaps on $1.5 billion of these fixed-rate notes to convert them to floating rates, mitigating interest rate exposure. A 50 BPS change in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the unhedged fixed-rate debt by approximately $0.3 billion. This suggests Cisco is managing a mix of short-term liquidity via commercial paper and longer-term fixed-rate debt, with active hedging to manage interest rate risk across its capital structure.",

We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 30, 2022.\n\nCommercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $0.6 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 30, 2022, and no commercial paper outstanding as of July 31, 2021.\n\nCredit Facility On May 13, 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0  billion  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility  that  is  scheduled  to  expire  on  May  13,  2026. As  of  July  30,  2022,  we  were  in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement.  Any  advances  under  the  5-year  credit  agreement  will  accrue  interest  at  rates  that  are  equal  to,  based  on  certain conditions, either (a) with respect to loans in U.S. dollars, (i) LIBOR or (ii) the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) a daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%), (b) with respect to loans in Euros, EURIBOR, (c) with respect to loans in Yen, TIBOR and (d) with respect to loans in Pounds Sterling, SONIA plus a credit spread adjustment, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Moody's Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the interest rate be less than 0.0%. We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.",

The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. For additional information, see Note 13.\n\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes that may be issued in the future pursuant to our short-term debt financing program, as discussed above under '(a) Short-Term Debt.' As of July 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\n\nAs of July 30, 2022, future principal payments for long-term debt, including the current portion, are summarized as follows (in millions):\n\n",

The carrying amount of the  senior  notes  was  $8.9  billion,  and  the  related  fair  value  based  on  market  prices  was  $9.7  billion.

As of July 30, 2022, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held investments was $1.9 billion, compared with $1.5 billion at July 31, 2021. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of privately held investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.",

      "answer": "The U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan allocated $251 million, or 64% of its total assets, to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents in 2021. This reflects a conservative risk management strategy, prioritizing capital preservation and stable returns to better match the plan\u2019s long-term liability profile.

This offering is explicitly tied to the company's broader Payment Security portfolio, which is described as being powered by 3-D Secure technology (page 11). The inclusion of 'Arcot payment authentication network powered by 3-D Secure' under the Payment Security category indicates that the Payment Security Suite is built on this foundational authentication framework. This alignment suggests that Broadcom is leveraging its established 3-D Secure infrastructure to deliver modern, cloud-delivered payment authentication solutions that address evolving fraud risks in digital commerce.

Our Symantec endpoint security solutions prevent, detect and respond to emerging threats across all devices and operating systems including laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile phones, servers and cloud workloads through an intelligent AI driven security console and single agent.\n\nNetwork Security: Email and web access are the lifeblood and essential communication means for every modern organization. We have a full array of network security solutions, as well as a shared set of advanced threat protection technologies to stop inbound and outbound threats targeting end users, information and key infrastructure.\n\nInformation Security: Information protection and compliance is critical to managing risk. We offer integrated information security solutions, based on an efficient, single-policy that can be applied across the entire environment, to help organizations identify and protect risky users, applications and their most sensitive data everywhere across endpoints, on-premises networks, cloud services and private applications.\n\nIdentity Security: User identities are under attack by cyber criminals hoping to exploit their access and privileges and do harm. We mitigate these attacks by positively identifying legitimate users, enforcing granular access control policies, and streamlining access governance to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data.\n\nFibre Channel Switch Products: Our Brocade Fibre Channel switch products provide interconnection, bandwidth and high-speed switching between servers and storage devices which are in a FC SAN. FC SANs are networks dedicated to mission critical storage traffic, and enable simultaneous high speed and secure connections among multiple host computers and multiple storage arrays.\n\nPayment Security Suite: This is a software as a service ('SaaS')-based payment authentication service to help banks and merchants protect against fraud and ensure a hassle-free online shopping experience for their customers.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nWe are committed to continuous investment in product development and enhancement, with a focus on rapidly introducing new, proprietary products and releases. Many of our products have grown out of our own research and development efforts, and have given us competitive advantages in certain target markets due to performance differentiation. However, we opportunistically seek to enhance our capabilities through the acquisition of engineers with complementary research and development skills and complementary technologies and businesses. We focus our research and development efforts on the development of mission critical, innovative, sustainable and higher value product platforms and those that improve the quality and stability in our broadly deployed products. We leverage our design capabilities in markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins by developing high value-add products.\n\nWe plan to continue investing in product development, both organically and through acquisitions, to drive growth in our business. We also invest in process development and improvements to product features and functions, as well as fabrication capabilities to optimize processes for devices that are manufactured internally. Our field application engineers, design engineers, and product and software development engineers are located in many places around the world, and in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the case of our semiconductor customers, enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products for them that leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position, and to ensure a continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.\n\n## Customers, Sales and Distribution\n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 56% and 53% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMany of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers. We have established",

      "answer": "Microsoft includes Software Assurance (SA) in Open Value agreements, which are designed for small and medium organizations licensing over a three-year period. Since SA is included by default, this affects the revenue recognition pattern because SA benefits are delivered over time, requiring judgment in estimating standalone selling prices (SSP) and recognizing revenue ratably over the coverage period. This contrasts with other licensing models where SA may be optional or not bundled, allowing for more upfront revenue recognition. The unearned revenue related to such programs, including SA and cloud services, is generally invoiced annually and recognized over the contract term, as noted in the financial reporting section on unearned revenue.",

We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

      "answer": "Microsoft positions Industry Solutions as part of a broader Enterprise and Partner Services portfolio designed to help customers deploy Microsoft and Nuance technologies effectively. However, this segment faces intense competition from both multinational consulting firms and specialized niche providers, as noted in the filing. Despite this strategic positioning, the segment experienced a revenue decline of 4% year-over-year\u2014from $7,900 million in 2023 to $7,594 million in 2024. This decline suggests potential challenges in maintaining growth amid competitive pressures, especially given the broad range of competitors\u2014from large firms with diversified service portfolios to agile niche players focused on specific technologies.

      "answer": "Cisco disclosed that a 50 BPS change in interest rates would impact the fair value of its senior fixed-rate debt (excluding $1.5 billion of hedged debt) by $0.3 billion. This sensitivity analysis applies to the $9.0 billion in senior fixed-rate notes, which are partially hedged through $1.5 billion in interest rate swaps that convert fixed rates to floating rates tied to LIBOR. These hedged senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes Cisco issues under its $10.0 billion short-term financing program. While the long-term fixed-rate notes are exposed to fair value changes from rate movements, the commercial paper notes, being short-term instruments, are inherently less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Thus, Cisco manages interest rate exposure through a combination of hedging and balancing fixed and floating rate debt instruments across its capital structure.",

These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.

      "answer": "Cisco's financing receivables include loan receivables that are directly tied to the sale of technical support and advanced services, with average terms ranging from one to three years. On page 82, the company explains that these loan receivables often cover not just the services themselves but also associated costs like network installation and integration. By page 84, the credit loss allowance for loan receivables is shown to have declined from $103 million in fiscal year 2022 to $53 million in 2023, despite provisions and net recoveries. This reduction in allowance suggests an improving credit risk profile, even though the multi-year duration of these financing arrangements for technical support services could expose Cisco to longer-term credit uncertainties. The interplay between the extended financing terms and the shrinking allowance implies a strategic tightening of credit risk exposure or improved collection performance on these service-linked receivables.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "question": "How does Apple's characterization of China Mainland as a supply chain risk factor relate to the financial performance of the Greater China segment, given that the segment includes China Mainland and reported $74.2 billion in net sales for 2022?",
      "answer": "Apple identifies China Mainland as a key part of its supply chain and highlights the risks associated with geopolitical tensions, including tariffs and trade restrictions, which could increase costs and disrupt operations. Despite these risks, the Greater China segment, which includes China Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, reported $74.2 billion in net sales for 2022, reflecting continued strong demand in the region. This suggests that while Apple is exposed to significant operational and political risks in China Mainland, the broader Greater China market remains a critical revenue driver, indicating a complex interplay between risk exposure and market opportunity.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's inclusion of Activision Blizzard's financials in the consolidated statements, despite excluding their internal controls from evaluation, relate to the assumption of Activision's 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 as part of the acquisition financing structure?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's consolidated financial statements include Activision Blizzard's financial results post-acquisition on October 13, 2023, but explicitly excluded Activision\u2019s internal controls from the evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, citing that Activision represented less than 1% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles) and 2% of total revenues. Meanwhile, the assumption of Activision\u2019s 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, as evidenced by the supplemental indenture filed on October 27, 2023, reflects Microsoft\u2019s direct financial liability assumption as part of the acquisition financing. This creates a tension between the limited operational control visibility and the full financial liability exposure Microsoft has taken on through the acquisition, particularly in terms of debt instruments like the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's long-term debt issuance strategy demonstrates a consistent reliance on the foundational Base Indenture established with BNY Mellon in 2009, as evidenced by the repeated use of supplemental indentures through 2016. The 2009 Base Indenture was used for a range of note issuances, including the 2.95% Notes due 2014, 4.20% Notes due 2019, and 5.20% Notes due 2039 (page 103), and continued to serve as the structural basis for new issuances such as the 1.625% Notes due 2018, 3.625% Notes due 2023, and 4.875% Notes due 2043 (page 105). This pattern reveals a deliberate and standardized approach to debt structuring, leveraging a stable trustee relationship to efficiently issue debt across varying maturities and interest rates over a seven-year period.",

      "answer": "Microsoft issued the 4.50% Notes due 2040 under a Second Supplemental Indenture dated September 27, 2010, with BNY Mellon serving as Trustee. This issuance is part of a broader pattern of long-term debt instruments, including notes due in 2043, 2045, and 2055, many of which were also administered by BNY Mellon or successor trustees like U.S. Bank. The repeated use of similar indenture structures and trusted counterparties suggests a deliberate capital structure strategy focused on long-term financing stability and access to global capital markets.",

      "question": "How does the change in the allowance for credit loss on loan receivables between fiscal years 2022 and 2023 reflect the risk profile of Cisco's financing activities tied to technical support services?",
      "answer": "The allowance for credit loss on loan receivables decreased from $103 million in fiscal 2022 to $53 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a reduction in perceived credit risk. Loan receivables are directly tied to the sale of Cisco's products and services, including technical support. Despite this decline in allowance, Cisco continues to offer financing for technical support as part of its broader financing receivables, which decreased by 2% year-over-year. This suggests that while the company reduced its credit loss provisioning for loan receivables, it still actively finances customer purchases of services like technical support, potentially signaling improved credit quality or tighter underwriting standards in financing arrangements.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's issuance of debt instruments like the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 relate to its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc., and what implications does this have for the company's internal control over financial reporting given Activision Blizzard's exclusion from the assessment?",
      "answer": "Microsoft introduced the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 as part of its broader debt structure on page 106, which was originally issued by Activision Blizzard, Inc. prior to its acquisition. According to page 107, Activision Blizzard, Inc. issued these notes under a base indenture with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, indicating that the debt was a pre-existing obligation of Activision Blizzard before Microsoft's acquisition. On page 99, Microsoft discloses that Activision Blizzard was excluded from the internal control over financial reporting assessment due to its acquisition on October 13, 2023, with its financials representing less than 1% of total assets and 2% of total revenues. This implies that while Microsoft has assumed responsibility for the debt obligations of Activision Blizzard, such as the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, the company has not yet fully integrated Activision Blizzard\u2019s internal controls into its overall financial reporting framework. This creates a risk that liabilities like these notes may not be fully aligned with Microsoft\u2019s consolidated internal control mechanisms, potentially affecting transparency and financial assurance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_106) \u2192 [3.400% Senior Notes due 2026]: Microsoft references the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 as part of its exhibit list, indicating its awareness and incorporation of this debt instrument into its financial structure.",
        "Hop 2: [3.400% Senior Notes due 2026] \u2192 [Activision Blizzard, Inc.]: The notes were originally issued by Activision Blizzard under a base indenture with Wells Fargo Bank, as detailed in the exhibit list on page 107, showing the direct link between the debt and the acquired company.",
        "Hop 3: [Activision Blizzard, Inc.] \u2190 [MSFT](page_99): Microsoft excluded Activision Blizzard from its internal control over financial reporting assessment, citing its acquisition date and relatively small contribution to total assets and revenues (less than 1% and 2%, respectively)."

      "answer": "Microsoft received a tax benefit from Notice 2023-55, which delayed the effective date of the Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations to fiscal year 2024. This delay allowed Microsoft to defer compliance with these regulations, which in turn contributed to a lower effective tax rate of 18% in fiscal year 2024 compared to 19% in fiscal year 2023. The deferral of these regulations, further extended indefinitely by Notice 2023-80, provided Microsoft with continued flexibility in managing its foreign tax credits, thereby supporting a more favorable tax position during a period of increasing global tax scrutiny.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## Effective Tax Rate\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectiv ely. The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

This judgment is necessary due to the various benefits bundled within SA, such as upgrade rights and support, which affect the pattern of delivery and customer benefit recognition. Open Value agreements, which are designed for small and medium organizations and include SA, represent a structured way in which these bundled offerings are delivered over a three-year period.

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

      "question": "How does ACN's exposure to short-notice client contract terminations affect its ability to realize value from its $6.6 billion in strategic acquisitions and $1.2 billion R&D investment in AI and digital platforms?",
      "answer": "ACN faces significant exposure to client contract terminations with as little as 30 days' notice, particularly for consulting contracts, which creates revenue instability. This risk is amplified by the fact that many contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, or reduce spending without substantial penalties, making it difficult to predict revenue streams needed to support the $6.6 billion invested in strategic acquisitions and $1.2 billion in R&D during fiscal 2024. At the same time, ACN's growth strategy hinges on leveraging these investments\u2014especially in AI platforms like AI Navigator for Enterprise\u2014to deliver transformational services and drive long-term client partnerships. However, if clients terminate or delay engagements due to economic pressures, strategic shifts, or adoption of competing technologies, ACN may struggle to deploy these capabilities effectively or achieve expected returns on its investments. This dynamic highlights a tension between ACN's capital-intensive growth strategy and the inherent volatility in client spending patterns, which could delay revenue recovery or diminish the strategic value of these investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ACN(page_43) \u2192 Contract Terms: Discloses that many contracts are terminable with short notice (e.g., 30 days) and with little or no penalties, affecting revenue predictability.",
        "Hop 2: Contract Terms \u2192 Clients: Discusses how client decisions to terminate, delay, or reduce spending can disproportionately impact ACN\u2019s revenue and operational results, especially in concentrated client relationships.",
        "Hop 3: Clients \u2190 ACN(page_6): Highlights ACN\u2019s $6.6 billion in strategic acquisitions and $1.2 billion R&D investment in AI and digital platforms aimed at deepening client partnerships and driving transformation."

      "question": "How does the indefinite delay of the final foreign tax credit regulations, as extended by Notice 2023-80, affect Microsoft's effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior year, and what does this imply about the company's tax planning strategy around foreign income?",
      "answer": "The indefinite delay of the final foreign tax credit regulations, extended by Notice 2023-80, contributed to a decrease in Microsoft's effective tax rate from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 18% in fiscal year 2024. This delay allowed Microsoft to continue benefiting from lower foreign tax rates, particularly through its regional operating center in Ireland, which generated 83% of foreign income before tax in fiscal year 2024. The tax benefits from this regulatory delay, along with continued earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions, reflect a strategic advantage in Microsoft's international tax planning, enabling the company to maintain a lower effective tax rate despite global tax environment changes such as the OECD's Pillar Two initiative.",

        "Hop 2: [Notice 2023-80] \u2192 [Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations]: Notice 2023-80 directly delays the implementation of the final foreign tax credit regulations, allowing Microsoft to avoid immediate compliance and continue benefiting from existing tax structures.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## Effective Tax Rate\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectiv ely. The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

          "chunk_text": "Endpoint Security: Endpoints are the critical last line of defense against cyber attackers. Our Symantec endpoint security solutions prevent, detect and respond to emerging threats across all devices and operating systems including laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile phones, servers and cloud workloads through an intelligent AI driven security console and single agent.\n\nNetwork Security: Email and web access are the lifeblood and essential communication means for every modern organization. We have a full array of network security solutions, as well as a shared set of advanced threat protection technologies to stop inbound and outbound threats targeting end users, information and key infrastructure.\n\nInformation Security: Information protection and compliance is critical to managing risk. We offer integrated information security solutions, based on an efficient, single-policy that can be applied across the entire environment, to help organizations identify and protect risky users, applications and their most sensitive data everywhere across endpoints, on-premises networks, cloud services and private applications.\n\nIdentity Security: User identities are under attack by cyber criminals hoping to exploit their access and privileges and do harm. We mitigate these attacks by positively identifying legitimate users, enforcing granular access control policies, and streamlining access governance to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data.\n\nFibre Channel Switch Products: Our Brocade Fibre Channel switch products provide interconnection, bandwidth and high-speed switching between servers and storage devices which are in a FC SAN. FC SANs are networks dedicated to mission critical storage traffic, and enable simultaneous high speed and secure connections among multiple host computers and multiple storage arrays.\n\nPayment Security Suite: This is a software as a service ('SaaS')-based payment authentication service to help banks and merchants protect against fraud and ensure a hassle-free online shopping experience for their customers.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nWe are committed to continuous investment in product development and enhancement, with a focus on rapidly introducing new, proprietary products and releases. Many of our products have grown out of our own research and development efforts, and have given us competitive advantages in certain target markets due to performance differentiation. However, we opportunistically seek to enhance our capabilities through the acquisition of engineers with complementary research and development skills and complementary technologies and businesses. We focus our research and development efforts on the development of mission critical, innovative, sustainable and higher value product platforms and those that improve the quality and stability in our broadly deployed products. We leverage our design capabilities in markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins by developing high value-add products.\n\nWe plan to continue investing in product development, both organically and through acquisitions, to drive growth in our business. We also invest in process development and improvements to product features and functions, as well as fabrication capabilities to optimize processes for devices that are manufactured internally. Our field application engineers, design engineers, and product and software development engineers are located in many places around the world, and in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the case of our semiconductor customers, enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products for them that leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position, and to ensure a continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.\n\n## Customers, Sales and Distribution\n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 56% and 53% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMany of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers. We have established",

      "answer": "The consistent 70% allocation of fixed income securities and cash equivalents to the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan in both 2020 and 2021 suggests that Texas Instruments maintains a relatively stable, conservative investment strategy for this pension fund, prioritizing capital preservation and predictable returns. When cross-referenced with the actual asset values from 2020, where $743 million of the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan's $1,061 million in total assets were held in fixed income securities and cash equivalents, this allocation reflects a deliberate emphasis on low-risk instruments. This alignment between the percentage allocation and the dollar-based asset breakdown indicates a consistent risk-averse posture in managing defined benefit liabilities, likely aimed at ensuring stable funding and minimizing volatility in meeting long-term pension obligations.",

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Examples of our significant accounting estimates and policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others include: the estimation of sales-based royalty revenues; the impairment of non-marketable equity investments; the valuation of inventories; the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the recognition, measurement and disclosure of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings; and the calculation of our income tax provision, including the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nFiscal Year. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\n\nCash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and notes and certain bank time deposits, U.S. Treasury securities and governmentrelated securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\n\nMarketable Securities. Marketable securities include marketable equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities and, from time-to-time, certain time deposits. We classify marketable securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nIf a debt security has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security. For the remaining debt securities, if an unrealized loss ex ists, we separate the impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factors and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factors. Unrealized gains or unrealized losses that are not related to credit factors on available-forsale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities and subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment and other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and economy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\n\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with equity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in net earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are generally recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. We monitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee's financial condition and business forecasts and lower",

Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases.

      "question": "How does Apple's reliance on third-party content providers for maintaining the attractiveness of its hardware ecosystem relate to its financial commitments for content licensing and distribution rights, especially considering the uncertainty in renewing these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms?",
      "answer": "Apple's ability to attract customers to its hardware ecosystem depends significantly on the availability of third-party software and digital content (page 13). However, the Company faces risks as third-party content providers may limit access or increase licensing costs, and there is no guarantee these arrangements will be renewed on favorable terms. Meanwhile, Apple reports substantial unconditional purchase obligations related to content licensing and distribution rights (page 48), indicating significant financial commitments. This creates a tension: while Apple depends on third-party content to drive hardware sales, it must manage fixed-cost obligations for content that may not be renewed or may become less compelling over time. This dynamic suggests a strategic challenge in balancing ecosystem appeal with financial exposure to content providers whose priorities may shift.",

      "question": "Given Apple's $19.4 billion in unrecognized RSU compensation tied to long-term talent retention, how does this investment align with the risk that third-party content providers may limit access to digital content due to short-term licensing arrangements?",
      "answer": "Apple faces a strategic tension between its long-term financial commitment to talent through $19.4 billion in outstanding RSUs and the uncertainty surrounding its ability to maintain access to third-party digital content. While the RSUs represent a multi-year investment to secure internal talent and innovation capabilities, the company explicitly acknowledges the risk that third-party content providers may choose to limit access to digital content or increase licensing costs, which could undermine Apple's ability to offer a compelling content ecosystem. This ecosystem is critical for driving customer demand for Apple's hardware products, yet the licensing arrangements for this content are often short-term and non-renewable on commercially reasonable terms, directly challenging the long-term value of the RSU-driven talent strategy.",

If  third-party  software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relativ e benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and X box for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the A pp Store.

From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future.

The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the A pp Store and Safari in the European Union ('EU') as it seeks to comply with the Digital M arkets A ct (the 'DM A '), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced A pp Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. \u00ae\n\n## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.

      "answer": "The 2021 allocation of 79% to fixed income securities and cash equivalents for the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan suggests a risk-averse strategy, yet this contrasts with the plan's disclosed expected return of -$81 million. This discrepancy implies that despite the conservative asset mix, the plan underperformed significantly, potentially due to low yields on fixed-income instruments in the prevailing economic environment or other external market pressures affecting returns. The conservative allocation typically aims to stabilize returns, yet the negative figure indicates that this strategy did not meet expectations in 2021.",
