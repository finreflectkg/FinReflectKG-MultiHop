      "question": "What is the full financial exposure and operational risk profile for NEE related to its participation in the secondary financial protection system, considering its nuclear liability insurance limits, retrospective assessment caps, and the potential impact of a nuclear incident on its business and financial condition?",
      "answer": "NEE faces a maximum retrospective assessment of up to $1,161 million ($664 million for FPL) per incident under the secondary financial protection system, payable at a rate not exceeding $173 million ($99 million for FPL) per year. This system, mandated by the Price-Anderson Act, provides up to $15.8 billion of liability insurance per incident for nuclear reactors in the U.S. However, a nuclear incident\u2014whether at a NEE/FPL facility or elsewhere\u2014could trigger retrospective assessments and/or insurance premiums, which could materially affect NEE's business, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, NEE's nuclear operations are subject to regulatory scrutiny from the NRC, which could impose fines, require shutdowns, or mandate costly safety upgrades, further increasing financial exposure. If NEE cannot recover these costs through insurance or regulatory mechanisms, or if incidents lead to reputational damage and operational disruptions, the company could face significant financial strain and reduced operational flexibility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLiability  for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-A nderson A ct, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this A ct, NEE maintains the maximum amount of private liability  insurance obtainable, and participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides liability insurance coverage for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums, plus any applicable taxes, for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident. Such assessments, if levied, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NEE  and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities, the addition of capacity at existing nuclear generation facilities and the construction of new nuclear generation facilities, and these requirements are subject to change. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down a nuclear generation facility , depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. A ny of the foregoing events could require NEE and FPL to incur increased costs and capital expenditures, and could reduce revenues.\n\nAny serious nuclear incident occurring at a NEE or FPL plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses. A  major incident at a nuclear facility  any where in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear generation facility . A n incident at a nuclear facility  any where in the world also could cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or other requirements on the industry , or on certain types of nuclear generation units, which could increase costs, reduce revenues and result in additional capital expenditures for NEE and FPL.\n\nThe inability to operate any of NE E 's or F PL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation facilities are not operated for any reason through the life of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions, NEE or FPL may be required to increase depreciation rates, incur impairment charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures, any of which could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, and for other purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE 's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including, but not limited to, inspections, repairs and certain other modifications as well as to replace equipment. In the event that a scheduled outage lasts longer than anticipated or in the event of an unplanned outage due to, for example, equipment failure, such outages could materially adversely affect NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks\n\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets, among other factors, may negatively affect NE E 's and F PL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and could also materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, liquidity , results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE and FPL rely on access to capital and credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements, refinancing activities to support existing debt maturities and other requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets related to, among others, inflation, rising or sustained higher interest rates and political, regulatory and geopolitical events, could increase NEE's and FPL's cost of capital and affect their ability  to fund their liquidity  and capital needs, to refinance ex isting indebtedness and to meet their growth objectives. If NEE or FPL is unable to access regularly the capital and credit markets on terms that are reasonable, it may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to maintain and grow its business, could contribute to lower earnings and reduced financial flex ibility , and could hav e a material adv erse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity , results of operations and prospects.\n\nAlthough certain NEE subsidiaries have used non-recourse or limited-recourse, project-specific or other financing in the past, market conditions, changes to regulatory capital requirements and other factors could adversely affect the future availability  of such financing. The inability of NEE's subsidiaries, including, without limitation, NEECH and its subsidiaries, to access the capital",

A dverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials, internal investigations or in legal claims. Responding to the negative publicity and any resulting investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from NEE's and FPL's business.\n\nAddressing any adverse publicity , governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of NEE and FPL, on the morale and performance of their employees and  on  their  relationships  with  regulators.  It  may   also  hav e  a  negativ e  impact  on  their  ability   to  take  timely   adv antage  of  v arious  business  and  market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity , and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected if F PL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in F lorida.\n\nFPL may negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida to provide electric services within such municipalities and counties, and electricity   sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a very substantial portion of FPL's revenues. If FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate such franchise agreements on acceptable terms, it could contribute to lower earnings and FPL may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures, which could adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.\n\nEmployee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers.  Personnel costs may also increase due to inflationary  or  competitiv e  pressures  on  payroll  and  benefits  costs  and  revised  terms  of  collectiv e  bargaining  agreements  with  union  employees.  These consequences could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's ability to successfully identify , complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry.\n\nNEE is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the energy industry . In addition, NEE may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner.\n\n## Nuclear Generation Risks\n\nThe operation and maintenance of NEE 's and F PL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including, but not limited to, those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities. NEE and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks; however, the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in NEE's and FPL's decommissioning funds, and the exposure to liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If NEE or FPL is unable to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or, in the case of FPL, through regulatory mechanisms, their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U .S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in E urope, NE E  and F PL could be assessed significant  retrospective  assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.",

See Note 9 - Other.\n\nInsurance - Liability  for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-A nderson A ct, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this A ct, NEE maintains $500 million of private liability  insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, except at Duane A rnold which obtained an exemption from the NRC and maintains a $100 million private liability  insurance limit. Each site, ex cept Duane A rnold, participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $15.8 billion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $1,161 million ($664 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed $173 million ($99 million for FPL) per incident per year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $20 million and $25 million, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.\n\nNEE  participates  in  a  nuclear  insurance  mutual  company ,  Nuclear  Electric  Insurance  Limited  (NEIL),  which  provides  property  damage,  nuclear  accident decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each plant for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear facilities, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. A dditionally , NEIL prov ides accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear plant. Pursuant to regulations of the NRC, each company's property damage insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied first to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident, and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning, plant repair or restoration.\n\nNEE and FPL nuclear facilities each have accident property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits of $1.5 billion, except for Duane A rnold which has a limit of $50 million due to being in a deferred decommissioning. A ll the nuclear facilities, except for Duane A rnold, also share an additional $1.25 billion nuclear accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. A ll coverages are subject to sublimits and deductibles.\n\nNEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to $167 million ($104 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane A rnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $3 million, $2 million and $4 million, plus any applicable taxes, respectively.\n\nDue to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's storm restoration costs exceed the storm reserve, such storm restoration costs may be recovered, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 1 - Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\n\nIn the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of Special Use Funds in NextEra Energy's consolidated balance sheet compare with the fair value disclosures and segment-specific reporting, and what does this reveal about the composition and valuation of these funds across different business units?",
      "answer": "The consolidated balance sheet on page 64 shows that Special Use Funds totaled $9,800 million in 2024. However, the fair value disclosures on page 56 indicate that NEE's Special Use Funds had a carrying amount of $2,294 million and FPL's were $1,741 million in 2024, summing to $4,035 million. Additionally, page 91 reports NEE's Special Use Funds at $1,342 million and FPL's at $915 million, totaling $2,257 million. This discrepancy suggests that the consolidated amount includes other entities beyond NEE and FPL, and that the fair value and segment-specific amounts differ from both the total carrying value and each other, highlighting complexity in how these funds are structured and valued across the organization.",

      "question": "How does NEE's ownership stake in XPLR OpCo, as detailed in its financial disclosures, align with its risk exposure and liquidity concerns related to the entity's ability to access capital and deliver expected cash distributions?",
      "answer": "NEE holds a noncontrolling interest in XPLR OpCo, with an investment valued at $3,315 million as of December 31, 2024. Despite not consolidating XPLR OpCo due to lack of control, NEE remains exposed to risks stemming from XPLR\u2019s potential inability to access capital on favorable terms, which could impair XPLR\u2019s ability to fund acquisitions or growth initiatives and, in turn, reduce cash distributions to NEE as a limited partner. Additionally, NEE\u2019s liquidity and ability to meet its own financial obligations are partially dependent on upstream distributions from subsidiaries and entities like XPLR OpCo, which could be constrained if XPLR struggles to raise capital or faces adverse market conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE (page_3) \u2192 XPLR OpCo: XPLR OpCo is defined in the glossary as a limited partnership in which NEE holds a limited partner interest, formerly known as NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP.",
        "Hop 2: NEE (page_98) \u2192 XPLR OpCo: NEE has a noncontrolling interest in XPLR OpCo, with an investment totaling $3,315 million as of December 31, 2024, and is not the primary beneficiary of the entity, which is treated as a VIE.",
        "Hop 3: NEE (page_34) \u2192 XPLR OpCo: NEE highlights that XPLR\u2019s inability to access capital on favorable terms could materially impact its ability to consummate acquisitions and deliver cash distributions to NEE as a limited partner, which in turn affects NEE\u2019s liquidity and financial performance."

A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these V IEs consisted primarily of property , plant and equipment and accounts payable.\n\nOther - A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $5,848 million ($4,506 million at FPL) and $4,962 million ($3,899 million at FPL), respectively , which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not inv olv ed in the initial design of these entities and do not hav e a controlling financial interest in these entities.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in X PLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered V IEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE's investment in these entities totaled approximately $3,315 million and $3,913 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . A t December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $175 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 - Commitments and - Contracts, respectively.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to three land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to 34 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $372 million and $387 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $396 million and $412 million. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases totaled approximately $826 million and $840 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $440 million and $444 million. NEE's lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.83% and 3.96%, respectively , for operating leases and 4.92% and 4.32%, respectively , for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 44 years and 44 years, respectively , for operating leases and 33 years and 32 years, respectively , for finance leases. A t December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $2.6 billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. A t December 31, 2024, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2026 to 2044 and NEE expects to receive approximately $3.9 billion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the  power  sales  agreements  with  no  one  year  being  material.  Operating  and  sales-type  lease-related  amounts  were  not  material  to  NEE's  consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n\n## 11. Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset  retirement  costs  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  method  the  regulator  allows  for  recovery  in  rates.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Certain of NEE 's assets and investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, which may materially adversely affect NEE 's liquidity , financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNEE holds certain assets and investments where changes in the fair value affect NEE's financial results. In some cases there may be no observable market values for these assets and investments, requiring fair value estimates to be based on other valuation techniques. This type of analysis requires significant judgment and the actual values realized in a sale of these assets and investments could differ materially from those estimated. A  sale of an asset or investment below previously estimated value, or other decline in the fair value of an asset or investment, could result in losses or the write-off of such asset or investment, and may have a material adverse effect on NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNEE has invested in various joint ventures and equity method investments where it does not have full control over operations, management or decision-making. In many cases, NEE shares control rights with its partners, but may lack influence or be dependent on their business priorities. This situation can lead to decisions that differ from NEE's preferences, potentially impacting the profitability and value of these investments. Furthermore, if a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations, NEE may be responsible for meeting certain obligations of the joint ventures as stipulated in its governing documents or applicable law. NEE's reliance on the joint venture partners, who may not always share NEE's business priorities, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NEE.\n\nNEE is a holding company and, as such, has no material operations of its own. Substantially all of NEE's consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries. NEE's ability  to meet its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, its guarantees, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on its subsidiaries' net income and cash flows, which are subject to the risks of their respective businesses, and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE.\n\nNEE's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no independent obligation to provide NEE with funds for its payment obligations. The subsidiaries have financial obligations, including, but not limited to, payment of debt service, which they must satisfy before they can provide NEE with funds. In addition, in the event of a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization, NEE's right to participate in a distribution of assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.\n\nThe dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements and which may be included in future financing agreements. The future enactment of laws or regulations also may prohibit or restrict the ability of NEE's subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds.\n\n## NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if NEE  is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.\n\nNEE guarantees many of the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries, other than FPL, through guarantee agreements with NEECH. These guarantees may require NEE to provide substantial funds to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when NEE is in need of liquidity to meet its own financial obligations. Funding such guarantees may materially adversely affect NEE's ability to meet its financial obligations or to pay dividends.\n\nXPLR may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NEE's limited partner interest in XPLR OpCo.\n\nThrough an indirect wholly owned subsidiary , NEE owns a limited partner interest in X PLR OpCo. X PLR's inability to access capital on commercially reasonable terms when acquisitions, other growth opportunities or capital needs arise could have a material adverse effect on X PLR's ability to deliver its cash distributions to its common unitholders in the future, including NEE, and on the value of NEE's limited partnership interest in X PLR OpCo. In addition, X PLR's issuance of additional common units or other securities in connection with acquisitions or the conversion of outstanding securities convertible into X PLR common units could cause significant common unitholder dilution and reduce future cash distributions, if any, to its common unitholders, including NEE.\n\n## Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may exert downward pressure on the market price of NE E 's common stock.\n\nThe market price and trading volume of NEE's common stock are subject to fluctuations as a result of, among other factors, general credit and capital market conditions and changes in market sentiment regarding the operations, business and financing strategies of NEE, its subsidiaries and its affiliates. A s a result, disruptions, uncertainty or volatility  in the credit and capital markets may, for ex ample, have a material adverse effect on the market price of NEE's common stock.",

      "answer": "NextEra Energy's investment in X PLR is marked by significant impairment charges, including a $0.8 billion impairment in 2024 and a prior $1.2 billion charge in 2023, indicating declining asset valuations and financial stress in the partnership. Despite these charges, NEE continues to derive value through renewable energy tax credits, with NEER's tax credit growth increasing by $477 million in 2024, partly attributable to X PLR's contracted renewable assets. NEE accounts for X PLR as an equity method investment, maintaining a 52.6% noncontrolling interest through XPLR OpCo, and receives fee income while also managing operational and credit support obligations, including $1.3 billion in guarantees and a $58 million recorded liability under the CSCS agreement. This mix of impairment risk, tax benefit capture, and ongoing operational involvement reflects a complex balance of strategic alignment and financial exposure.",

PTCs from wind and solar projects and ITCs from solar, battery storage and certain wind projects are included in NEER's earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. During the year ended December 31, 2024, renewable energy tax credits increased by approximately $477 million reflecting growth in NEER's business. See Note 1 - Income Taxes for a discussion of renewable energy tax credits, Note 5 and Note 16.\n\n## Corporate and Other: Results of Operations\n\nCorporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries.\n\nCorporate and Other's results increased $904 million during 2024 primarily due to favorable after-tax impacts of approximately $934 million, as compared to the prior year, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments used to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings (see Note 3).\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital (see Note 1 - Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery), capital expenditures (see Note 15 - Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 6), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 13 and Note 3) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt (see Note 13) and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors, sales of renewable energy tax credits (see Note 1 - Income T axes) and sales of ownership interests in assets/businesses (see Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets), consistent with NEE's and FPL's objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.\n\nIn October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests in X PLR. Under the program, purchases may be made in amounts, at prices and at such times as NEE or its subsidiaries deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. A ny purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated by NEE at any time. The purpose of the program is not to cause X PLR's common units to be delisted from the New Y ork Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. A s of December 31, 2024, the dollar value of units that may yet be purchased by NEE under this program was $114 million. A t December 31, 2024, NEE had an approximately 52.6% noncontrolling interest in XPLR, primarily through its limited partner interest in X PLR OpCo.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n52.6% noncontrolling interest in X PLR, primarily through its limited partner interest in X PLR OpCo, and accounts for its ownership interest in X PLR as an equity method investment. NextEra Energy Resources operates essentially all of the energy projects owned by XPLR and provides services to XPLR under various related party operations and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a cash sweep and credit support (CSCS) agreement with a subsidiary of XPLR. A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cash sweep amounts (due to XPLR and its subsidiaries) held in accounts belonging to NextEra Energy Resources or its subsidiaries were approximately $127 million and $1,511 million, respectively , and are included in accounts payable. Fee income related to the CSCS agreement and the service agreements totaled approximately $18 million, $59 million and $174 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively , and is included in operating revenues in NEE's consolidated statements of income. A mounts due from XPLR of approximately $159 million and $84 million are included in other receivables and $128 million and $114 million are included in noncurrent other assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . NEECH or NextEra Energy Resources guaranteed or provided indemnifications, letters of credit or surety bonds totaling approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 primarily related to obligations on behalf of X PLR's subsidiaries with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2059, including certain project performance obligations and obligations under financing and interconnection agreements. Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. A t December 31, 2024, approximately $58 million related to the fair value of the credit support provided under the CSCS agreement is recorded as noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\n\nDuring  2024,  2023  and  2022,  certain  services,  primarily  engineering,  construction,  transportation,  storage  and  maintenance  services,  were  provided  to subsidiaries of NEE by related parties that NEE accounts for under the equity method of accounting. Charges for these services amounted to approximately $749 million, $656 million and $579 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## 9. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\n\nNEER - A t December 31, 2024, NEE consolidates a number of VIEs within the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since they control the most significant activities of these V IEs, including operations and maintenance, and they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these V IEs.\n\nEight indirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have an ownership interest ranging from approximately 50% to 67% in entities which own and operate solar generation facilities with generating capacity of approximately 765 M W. Each of the subsidiaries is considered a V IE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates ranging from 2035 through 2052. These entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of  these  V IEs  were  approximately  $1,708  million  and  $520  million,  respectively ,  at  December  31,  2024.  There  were eight  of  these  consolidated  V IEs  at December 31, 2023 and the assets and liabilities of those V IEs at such date totaled approximately $1,796 million and $1,085 million, respectively . A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these V IEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.\n\nNextEra Energy Resources consolidates a VIE which has a 10% direct ownership interest in wind and solar generation facilities which have the capability of producing approximately 400 M W and 599 M W, respectively . These entities sell their electric output under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2025 through 2040. These entities are also considered a V IE because the holders of differential membership interests in these entities do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. The assets and liabilities of the V IE were approximately $1,346 million and $76 million, respectively , at December 31, 2024, and $1,434 million and $79 million, respectively , at December 31, 2023. A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets of this VIE consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment.\n\nNextEra Energy Resources consolidates 30 VIEs that primarily relate to certain subsidiaries which have sold differential membership interests in entities which own and operate wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities with generating/storage capacity of approximately 10,446  M W, 3,485 M W and 1,719 MW, respectively , and own wind generation and battery storage facilities that, upon completion of construction, which is anticipated in 2025, are expected to have generating/storage capacity of approximately 412 M W and 200 M W, respectively . These entities sell, or will sell, their electric output either under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2025 through 2054 or in the spot market. These entities are considered V IEs because the holders of differential  membership  interests  do  not  have  substantive  rights  over  the  significant  activities  of  these  entities.  Nex tEra  Energy   Resources  has  financing obligations with respect to these entities, including third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the other assets of these entities or by pledges of NextEra Energy Resources' ownership interest in these entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these V IEs totaled approximately $23,902 million and $1,546 million, respectively , at December  31,  2024.  There  were 33  of  these  consolidated  V IEs  at  December  31,  2023  and  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  those  V IEs  at  such  date  totaled approximately $24,250 million and $3,148",

      "answer": "The decline in NEER's 2024 net income by $1,259 million is partially attributable to its exposure to oil production assets, which are subject to significant market price volatility. On page 28, the filing notes that prolonged periods of low oil prices can reduce revenue, delay or cancel projects, and lead to asset impairments. This aligns with the drop in NEER's profitability. Additionally, on page 74, it is explained that these oil production assets are accounted for under the successful efforts method, with depletion expenses based on unit of production, meaning lower production or lower prices directly impact operating costs and earnings. Thus, the financial performance decline is closely tied to both the risk profile and accounting treatment of NEER\u2019s oil production investments.",

Such events or actions may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe ability of NE E  and F PL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NE E 's and F PL's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses.\n\nInsurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be available at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to NEE and FPL. The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, including impacts of actual or perceived climate-related events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. If NEE or FPL cannot or does not obtain insurance coverage, NEE or FPL may be required to pay costs associated with adverse future events. A dditionally , if certain unconsolidated subsidiaries of NEE do not obtain third-party insurance coverage, NEE may be required to pay costs associated with losses or adverse future events involving these entities.\n\nNEE and FPL generally are not fully insured against all significant losses. For example, NEE, including FPL, does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of its transmission and distribution property and natural gas pipeline assets. A  loss for which NEE or FPL is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE invests in natural gas and oil production assets which are exposed to fluctuating market prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and other energy commodities. A prolonged period of low natural gas and oil prices, disrupted production or unsuccessful drilling efforts could impact NEER's natural gas and oil production operations and cause NEER to delay or cancel certain natural gas and oil production projects and could result in certain assets becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNatural gas and oil prices are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally . Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural  disasters,  weather,  political  instability ,  conflicts,  new  discov eries,  technological  adv ances,  economic  conditions  and  actions  by   major  oil-producing countries. There can be significant volatility in market prices for natural gas and oil, and price fluctuations could have a material effect on the financial performance of natural gas and oil producing assets. For example, in a low natural gas and oil price environment, NEER would generate less revenue from its investments in natural gas and oil production properties, and as a result certain investments might become less profitable or incur losses. A dditionally , production could be disrupted due to weather or operational issues, among other causes, or drilling efforts could be unsuccessful. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices or low production, including from unsuccessful drilling efforts, could also result in the delay or cancellation of natural gas and oil production projects, could cause projects to experience lower returns, and could result in certain assets becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf cost recovery arrangements for increased supply costs necessary to provide NEER's full energy and capacity requirements services are not favorable, operating costs could increase and materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEER provides full energy and capacity requirements services  primarily  to  distribution  utilities,  which  include  load-following  serv ices  and  v arious  ancillary services, to satisfy all or a portion of such utilities' power supply obligations to their customers. The supply costs for these transactions may be affected by a number  of  factors,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  ev ents  that  may   occur  after  such  utilities  hav e  committed  to  supply   power,  such  as  weather  conditions, transmission constraints, fluctuating prices for, and locational disconnects in, energy and ancillary services, and the ability of the distribution utilities' customers to elect to receive service from competing suppliers. If any of these factors materialize, NEER may not be able to recover all of its increased supply costs, which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nDue to the potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and environmental and other energy-related commodities, NE E 's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risks within its portfolio could materially adversely affect NE E 's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThere can be significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and environmental and other energy-related commodities, both in general and across geographies. NEE's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively its assets or positions against changes in commodity prices, volumes, interest rates, counterparty credit risk or other risk measures, based on factors that are either within, or wholly or partially outside of, NEE's control, may materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",

In general, the net impact of these income statement line items is adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization or its reversal to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. See Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 above.\n\nNEER's electric plant in service and other property less salvage value, if any , are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful liv es. NEER reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. NEER's natural gas and oil production assets are accounted for under the successful efforts method. Depletion expenses for the acquisition of reserve rights and development costs are recognized using the unit of production method. Depreciation of  NEER's rate-regulated transmission assets are provided on a straight-line basis, primarily over their average remaining useful life.  NEER includes  in  depreciation  expense  a  provision  for  dismantlement,  interim  asset  removal  costs  and  accretion  related  to  asset  retirement  obligations.  For substantially all of NEER's rate-regulated transmission assets, depreciation studies are performed periodically and filed with FERC which result in updated depreciation rates.\n\nNuclear Fuel - FPL and NEER have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel. See Note 15 Contracts. FPL's and NEER's nuclear fuel costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production method.\n\nConstruction Activity - A llowance for funds used during construction (A FUDC) is a noncash item which represents the allowed cost of capital, including an ROE, used to finance construction projects. FPL records the portion of A FUDC attributable to borrowed funds as a reduction of interest expense and the remainder as other income. FPSC rules limit the recording of A FUDC to projects that have an estimated cost in excess of 0.4% of a utility's plant in service balance and require more than one year to complete. FPSC rules allow construction projects below the applicable threshold as a component of rate base.\n\nFPL's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, engineering costs, AFUDC and other costs directly associated with the construction of various projects. Upon completion of the projects, these costs are transferred to electric utility plant in service and other property. Capitalized costs associated with construction activities are charged to O&amp;M  expenses when recoverability is no longer probable.\n\nNEER capitalizes project development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of the related asset or sale of development rights. A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, NEER's capitalized development costs totaled approximately $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively , which are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. These costs include land rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a new project. Upon commencement of construction, these costs either are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets, depending upon the nature of the cost. Capitalized development costs are charged to O&amp;M  expenses when it is probable that these costs will not be realiz ed.\n\nNEER's  construction  work  in  progress  includes  construction  materials,  progress  payments  on  major  equipment  contracts,  third-party  engineering  costs, capitalized interest and other costs directly associated with the construction and development of various projects. Interest expense allocated from NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) to NextEra Energy Resources is based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. Upon commencement of project operation, costs associated with construction work in progress are transferred to electric plant in serv ice and other property.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations - NEE and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively , A ROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an A RO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. NEE's A ROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. See Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 11.\n\nFor NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the asset retirement cost is allocated to a regulatory liability or regulatory asset using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the A RO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the ARO and a decrease in the regulatory liability or regulatory asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the A RO and asset retirement cost, or regulatory liability when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n\nFor NEE's non-rate regulated operations, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the A RO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income.

A significant com petitive factor is price. G U &amp;I 's prim ary product com petition is with electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively im pact com petitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consum er. In the case of industrial custom ers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse econom ic or m arket conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these custom ers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs.\n\nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources m ay allow com petition from  alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging som e custom ers to m ove away from  natural gas-fired equipm ent to equipm ent fueled by other energy sources. C om petition between natural gas and other form s of energy is also based on efficiency, perform ance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. T echnological im provem ents in other energy sources and events that im pair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode G U &amp;I's com petitive advantage. T hese factors in turn could decrease the dem and for natural gas, im pair G U &amp;I's ability to attract new custom ers and cause existing custom ers to switch to other form s of energy or to bypass G U &amp;I's system s in favor of alternative com petitive sources. T his could result in slow or no custom er growth for G U &amp;I and could cause custom ers to reduce or cease using natural gas, thereby reducing G U &amp;I's ability to m ake capital expenditures and otherwise grow its business, adversely affecting its earnings.\n\n## Natural Gas Investments\n\nDuke E nergy, through its G U &amp;I segm ent, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal T rail. Sabal T rail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal T rail N atural G as P ipeline, which is regulated by FE R C  and traverses Alabam a, G eorgia, and F lorida to transport natural gas to F lorida. D uke E nergy, also through its G U &amp;I segm ent, has a 47% equity ownership interest in AC P  and investm ents in various renewable natural gas joint ventures. D uke E nergy determ ined that it would no longer invest in AC P , and the construction of the AC P  pipeline, in 2020.\n\nGU&amp;I has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in C ardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in N orth C arolina regulated by the N C U C , a 45% equity ownership in P ine N eedle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in N orth C arolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in H ardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and H am pshire counties in W est Virginia. P ine N eedle and H ardy Storage are regulated by F E R C .\n\nGU&amp;I sold all of KO  T ransm ission's pipeline facilities and related real property to C olum bia G as T ransm ission, LLC  in F ebruary 2023 for approxim ately book value.\n\nSee Notes 4, 13 and 18 to the C onsolidated Financial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters,\" \"Investm ents in U nconsolidated Affiliates\" and \"Variable Interest E ntities,\" respectively, for further inform ation on D uke E nergy's and G U &amp;I's natural gas investm ents.\n\n## Inventory\n\nGU&amp;I m ust m aintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to custom ers. As of D ecem ber 31, 2024, the inventory balance for G U &amp;I was $95 m illion. F or more inform ation on inventory, see N ote 1 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"Sum m ary of Significant Accounting P olicies.\"\n\n## Regulation\n\n## State\n\nThe state utility com m issions approve rates for D uke E nergy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. T he state utility com m issions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of G U &amp;I's natural gas distribution facilities. C P C N s issued by the state utility com m issions or other governm ent agencies, as applicable, authorize GU&amp;I to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale custom ers. P rior approval from  the relevant state utility com m ission is required for G U &amp;I to issue securities. T he underlying concept of utility ratem aking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\n\nI n addition to am ounts collected from  custom ers through approved base rates, each of the state utility com m issions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective com m ission determ ines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\n\nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by G U &amp;I. D ue to the associated regulatory treatm ent and the m ethod allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from  year to year have no m aterial im pact on operating results of G U &amp;I, unless a com m ission finds a portion of such costs to have been im prudent. H owever, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from  custom ers can adversely im pact the tim ing of cash flows of G U &amp;I. G U &amp;I also has various regulatory m echanism s in place to track and recover certain costs associated with capital investm ents including the IM R  in N orth C arolina, AR M  in T ennessee, and C E P  R ider in O hio.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's repayment and termination of DERF in early 2025 reflect on its broader debt management strategy, especially considering DERF's role as a consolidated VIE and its classification under the parent company's debt structure?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy's repayment and termination of DERF in January 2025, involving $500 million in borrowings, reflects a strategic move to reduce reliance on special-purpose financing vehicles and consolidate financial control. DERF, as a consolidated VIE, was used to finance receivables, with its debt previously reflected on Duke Energy Carolinas' balance sheet as 'Current maturities of long-term debt.' This action aligns with Duke Energy's broader debt management approach, as seen in the repayment of similar VIEs like DEFR and DEF R in 2024, and suggests a trend toward streamlining financial obligations and managing liquidity by internalizing receivables previously held off-balance sheet.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [DUK](page_203) \u2192 [DERF]: DERF is a consolidated VIE used for receivables financing, with $500 million in borrowings repaid in January 2025, and its restricted receivables of $1,081 million transferred back to Duke Energy Carolinas.",
        "Hop 2: [DUK](page_7) \u2192 [DERF]: DERF is explicitly defined as Duke Energy Receivables Finance Company, LLC, indicating its structural role within the Duke Energy Registrants' financial framework.",
        "Hop 3: [DUK](page_61) \u2192 [DERF]: DERF's repayment is part of a broader pattern of VIE terminations, including CRC and DEF R, signaling a strategic shift in Duke Energy\u2019s debt and liquidity management."

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n\nA VIE  is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using m ore than a sim ple analysis of voting control. T he analysis to determ ine whether an entity is a VIE  considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, the adequacy of the equity investm ent of an entity and the relationship of voting power to the am ount of equity invested in an entity. T his analysis is perform ed either upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of an event requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entity's assets or activities. A qualitative analysis of control determ ines the party that consolidates a VIE . T his assessm ent is based on (i) what party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE  that m ost significantly im pact its econom ic perform ance and (ii) what party has rights to receive benefits or is obligated to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE . T he analysis of the party that consolidates a VIE  is a continual reassessm ent.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED VIE s\n\nThe obligations of the consolidated VIE s discussed in the following paragraphs are nonrecourse to the D uke E nergy R egistrants. T he registrants have no requirem ent to provide liquidity to, purchase assets of or guarantee perform ance of these VIE s unless noted in the following paragraphs.\n\nNo financial support was provided to any of the consolidated VIE s during the years ended D ecem ber 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, or is expected to be provided in the future, that was not previously contractually required.\n\n## Receivables Financing - D E R F/D E PR /D E F R\n\nDERF, D E P R  and D E F R  are bankruptcy rem ote, special purpose subsidiaries of D uke E nergy C arolinas, D uke E nergy P rogress and D uke E nergy F lorida, respectively.

O n a revolving basis, D E R F , D E P R  and D E F R  buy certain accounts receivable arising from  the sale of electricity and related services from  their parent com panies.\n\nDERF, D E P R  and D E F R  borrow am ounts under credit facilities to buy these receivables. Borrowing availability from  the credit facilities is lim ited to the am ount of qualified receivables purchased, which generally exclude receivables past due m ore than a predeterm ined num ber of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligations is cash collections from  the receivables. Am ounts borrowed under the D E R F , D E P R , and D E F R  credit facilities are reflected on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets as C urrent m aturities of long-term  debt.\n\nThe m ost significant activity that im pacts the econom ic perform ance of D E R F , D E P R  and D E F R  are the decisions m ade to m anage delinquent receivables. D uke E nergy C arolinas, D uke Energy P rogress and D uke E nergy Florida are considered the prim ary beneficiaries and consolidate D E R F , D E P R  and D E F R , respectively, as they m ake those decisions.\n\nI n April 2024, D uke E nergy F lorida repaid all outstanding D E F R  borrowings totaling $325 m illion and term inated the related D E F R  credit facility.

      "question": "How does Southern Company's exposure to domestic equity investments evolve across its nuclear decommissioning trusts, gas segment deferred compensation plans, and consolidated trust investments, and what does this reveal about the company's overall asset allocation strategy?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's exposure to domestic equity investments varies significantly across its nuclear decommissioning trusts, gas segment deferred compensation plans, and consolidated trust investments. In the nuclear decommissioning trusts, domestic equity investments totaled $684 million for Alabama Power and $324 million for Georgia Power as of December 31, 2021, with a significant portion categorized under Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets). In the gas segment, Southern Company Gas held $9 million in domestic equity through non-qualified deferred compensation trusts as of December 31, 2020. Meanwhile, consolidated trust investments across the entire company showed a much larger holding of $1,013 million in domestic equity as of December 31, 2020, with a split between Level 1 and Level 2 valuation methods. This variation suggests a tiered asset allocation strategy where different segments maintain distinct risk profiles, with the consolidated trusts showing broader market exposure while nuclear trusts emphasize more liquid equity investments.",

      "question": "How does Southern Power justify the $40 million loss recognized on the Garland Battery Energy Storage Facility while maintaining a 95% investment coverage ratio through 2026, given the remaining $230-270 million construction commitment for the facility?",
      "answer": "Southern Power recognized a $40 million loss upon commencement of the PPAs related to the Garland Battery Energy Storage Facility, driven by the ITCs retained and expected to be realized by Southern Power and its partners. Despite this near-term loss and the additional $230-270 million in expected construction costs, Southern Power maintains a 95% investment coverage ratio through 2026, indicating strong contractual support for its existing and under-construction assets. This suggests that the company is strategically balancing upfront losses from new renewable investments like Garland against long-term contracted revenue streams that bolster its overall investment coverage metrics.",

The 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Mississippi Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (103 MWs each) in December 2023, 2025, and 2026, respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life in the most recent approved depreciation studies. In addition, the schedule reflects the early retirement of Mississippi Power's 50% undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs) by the end of 2027.\n\nIn accordance with an accounting order issued by the Mississippi PSC on October 14, 2021, Mississippi Power reclassified $49 million of retail costs associated with Hurricanes Zeta and Ida to a regulatory asset to be recovered through PEP over a period to be determined in Mississippi Power's 2022 PEP proceeding. In addition, on December 7, 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which requested an increase in retail revenues of approximately $9 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of March 2022 to restore the property damage reserve.\n\nOn January 18, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's retail fuel cost recovery filing, which requested an increase in revenues of approximately $43 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of February 2022.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power\" for additional information.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nDuring 2021, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 118-MW Glass Sands wind facility, 73 MWs of the 88-MW Garland battery energy storage facility, and 32 MWs of the 72-MW Tranquillity battery energy storage facility. Southern Power continues construction of the remainder of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities. On March 26, 2021, Southern Power purchased a controlling membership interest in the 300-MW Deuel Harvest wind facility located in Deuel County, South Dakota from Invenergy Renewables LLC.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected inservice value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2021 was 95% through 2026 and 92% through 2031, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 13 years.\n\nSee Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for additional information.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nOn April 28, 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP) with the Georgia PSC, which includes a series of ongoing and proposed pipeline safety, reliability, and growth programs for the next 10 years, as well as the required capital investments and related costs to implement the programs. On November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an October 14, 2021 joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC, under which, for the years 2022 through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its combined GRAM and System Reinforcement Rider request by 10% through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM mechanism, or $5 million for 2022. The stipulation agreement also provides for $1.7 billion of total capital investment for the years 2022 through 2024.\n\nAlso on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $43 million effective January 1, 2022.",

In 2021, net income decreased $80 million, or 80.8%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges totaling $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for information regarding the September 2021 cancellation of the PennEast Pipeline project.\n\n## Wholesale Gas Services\n\nPrior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services was involved in asset management and optimization, storage, transportation, producer and peaking services, natural gas supply, natural gas services, and wholesale gas marketing. Southern Company Gas positioned the business to generate positive economic earnings on an annual basis even under low volatility market conditions that can result from a number of factors. When market price volatility increased, wholesale gas services was positioned to capture significant value and generate stronger results. Operating expenses primarily reflected employee compensation and benefits. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nIn 2021, net income increased $93 million compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $114 million increase in operating revenues due to higher commercial activity driven by natural gas price volatility that was generated by cold weather, partially offset by unfavorable storage and transportation derivatives due to widening transportation spreads, as well as a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, partially offset by a $14 million increase in other operating expenses primarily related to an increase in variable compensation, a $101 million decrease in other income and (expense) related to higher charitable contributions, and a $29 million increase in income tax expense due to higher pre-tax earnings.\n\n## Gas Marketing Services\n\nGas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.\n\nIn 2021, net income decreased $1 million, or 1.1%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses primarily related to a $73 million increase in the cost of gas in 2021 resulting from higher natural gas prices, largely offset by a $67 million increase in operating revenues due to higher natural gas prices and increased retail price spreads.\n\n## All Other\n\nAll other includes natural gas storage businesses, including Jefferson Island through its sale on December 1, 2020, fuels operations through the sale of Southern Company Gas' interest in Pivotal LNG on March 24, 2020, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements.\n\nIn 2021, net loss increased $85 million compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to additional tax expense due to changes in state apportionment rates as a result of the sale of Sequent. See Note 10 to the financial statements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL\n\n## General\n\nPrices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distributed by the natural gas distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed through various regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities for the foreseeable future. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Utility Regulation\" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to pooled funds - fixed income change between 2020 and 2021, and how does this shift reflect in the fair value disclosures across different reporting segments?",
      "answer": "In 2020, Southern Company Gas reported $17 million in pooled funds - fixed income under fair value measurements (Level 2 inputs) as disclosed on page_315. Additionally, on page_313, the broader company's investments in trusts also included $17 million in pooled funds - fixed income for the same year. By 2021, this value decreased to $13 million as reported on page_310. The consistent use of Level 2 inputs across both years indicates the company relied on observable market data to value these investments, but the reduction in fair value from $17 million to $13 million suggests a strategic adjustment in fixed income allocations over the period.",

      "question": "What was the change in Southern Company's holdings of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities from 2020 to 2021 in its general investment trusts versus its nuclear decommissioning trusts?",
      "answer": "In 2020, Southern Company held $284 million in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities within its general investment trusts, as disclosed on page_313. By 2021, this amount increased slightly to $314 million, as shown on page_310. In contrast, the nuclear decommissioning trusts held $21 million in such securities in 2021 for Alabama Power and $293 million for Georgia Power, as detailed on page_311. This indicates a significant shift toward U.S. Treasury and government agency securities within nuclear decommissioning funds, while the general investment trusts showed a modest increase year-over-year.",

      "question": "How does NextEra Energy's financial treatment and strategic outlook for its investment in the Mountain Valley Pipeline reconcile across its equity method disclosures, impairment analysis, and fair value estimation processes?",
      "answer": "NextEra Energy's investment in the Mountain Valley Pipeline is initially disclosed as part of its equity method investments totaling $6,159 million as of December 31, 2021 (page 96). However, due to ongoing legal and regulatory setbacks, including the 4th Circuit's vacatur of the Biological Opinion and right-of-way grant, the company re-evaluated the investment's fair value and determined a very low probability of completion (page 92). This led to a $0.8 billion impairment charge in early 2022, effectively writing off the entire carrying value of the investment and recognizing a $0.2 billion liability for future ARO costs (page 37). The progression from a reported equity stake in a construction project to a fully impaired asset with contingent liabilities illustrates a significant shift in both financial treatment and strategic expectations regarding the Mountain Valley Pipeline.",

The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized.\n\n(b) See Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests for a discussion of the sale of two solar generation facilities in Spain (Spain projects).\n\n(c) For 2019, approximately $44 million, $20 million and $6 million of costs are included in Corporate and Other's, Gulf Power's and NEER's net income, respectively.\n\n(d) See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the impairment charge in 2020 related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Mountain Valley Pipeline).\n\nNEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected  or  has  been  discontinued.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  those  transactions  are  marked  to  market  and  reported  in  the  consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the  non-qualifying  hedge  category  for  certain  energy  derivatives  is  offset  by  decreases  (increases)  in  the  fair  value  of  related  physical  asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category, referred to as trading activities,  which  is  included  in  adjusted  earnings,  represents  the  net  unrealized  effect  of  actively  traded  positions  entered  into  to  take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\n## 2021 Summary\n\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2021 was higher than 2020 by $654 million, or $0.33 per share, assuming dilution, due to higher results at the FPL segment, Corporate and Other, NEER and Gulf Power.\n\nFPL's net income increased by $316 million in 2021 primarily reflecting higher results at the FPL segment and at Gulf Power. The FPL segment's increase in net income for 2021 was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property. Gulf Power's increase in net income in 2021 was primarily driven by reductions in O&amp;M expenses.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nearnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe fair value estimate was based on a probability-weighted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple valuation  technique  using  a  market  participant  view  of  the  potential  different  outcomes  for  the  investment. As  part  of  the  valuation,  NextEra Energy  Resources  used  observable  inputs  where  available,  including  the  EBITDA  multiples  of  recent  pipeline  transactions.  Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), including the probabilities assigned to the different potential outcomes, the forecasts of operating revenues and costs, and the projected capital expenditures to complete the project, were also used in the estimation of fair value. An increase in the revenue forecasts,  a  decrease  in  the  projected  operating  or  capital  expenditures  or  an  increase  in  the  probability  assigned  to  the  full  pipeline  being completed  would  result  in  an  increased  fair  market  value.  Changes  in  the  opposite  direction  of  those  unobservable  inputs  would  result  in  a decreased fair market value.\n\nOn  February  2,  2022,  the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Fourth  Circuit  (the  4th  Circuit)  vacated  and  remanded  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline's Biological Opinion issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While NextEra Energy Resources continues to evaluate options and next steps with its joint venture partners, this event along with the 4th Circuit vacatur and remand of the U.S. Forest Service right-of-way grant on January 25,  2022  caused  NextEra  Energy  Resources  to  re-evaluate  its  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline  for  further  other-than-temporary impairment, which evaluation coincided with the preparation of NEE's December 31, 2021 financial statements. As a result of this evaluation, it was determined that the continued legal and regulatory challenges have resulted in a very low probability of pipeline completion. Accordingly, NextEra Energy Resources updated its fair value estimate using the same probability-weighted EBITDA multiple valuation technique using a market participant view of the potential different outcomes for the investment as discussed above. Based on this fair value analysis, NextEra Energy Resources recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2022 of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax). This impairment charge resulted in the complete write off of NextEra Energy Resources' equity method investment carrying amount of approximately $0.6 billion, as well as the recording of a liability of approximately $0.2 billion which reflects NextEra Energy Resources' share of estimated future ARO costs.\n\n## 5.

The difference for both years is net of an approximately $1.5 billion impairment charge  in  2020  related  to  NextEra  Energy  Resources'  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2022,  NextEra  Energy  Resources  recorded  an  additional impairment  charge  to  completely  write  off  its  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline.  See  Note  4  -  Nonrecurring  Fair  Value  Measurements  for  a  discussion  of  the  impairment charges.\n\nNextEra  Energy  Resources  provides  operational,  management  and  administrative  services  as  well  as  transportation  and  fuel  management services to NEP and its subsidiaries under various agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a cash sweep and credit support (CSCS) agreement with a subsidiary of NEP. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash sweep amounts (due to NEP and its subsidiaries)  held  in  accounts  belonging  to  NextEra  Energy  Resources  or  its  subsidiaries  were  approximately  $57  million  and  $10  million, respectively,  and  are  included  in  accounts  payable.  Fee  income  related  to  the  CSCS  agreement  and  the  service  agreements  totaled approximately $148 million, $120 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in operating revenues in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Amounts due from NEP of approximately $113 million and $68 million are included  in  other  receivables  and  $40  million  and  $32  million  are  included  in  noncurrent  other  assets  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.  See  also  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests  for  amounts  due  to  NEP  for reimbursement of construction-related costs. NEECH or NextEra Energy Resources guaranteed or provided indemnifications, letters of credit or surety bonds totaling approximately $3,778 million at December 31, 2021 primarily related to obligations on behalf of NEP's subsidiaries with maturity  dates  ranging  from  2022  to  2059,  including  certain  project  performance  obligations,  obligations  under  financing  and  interconnection agreements and obligations, primarily incurred and future construction payables, associated with the December 2021 sale of projects to NEP (see Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests). Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. At December 31, 2021, approximately $41 million related to the fair value of the credit support provided under the CSCS agreement is recorded as noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## 9. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\n\nNEER - At  December 31, 2021, NEE consolidates a number of VIEs within the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered  the  primary  beneficiary  of  these  VIEs  since  they  control  the  most  significant  activities  of  these  VIEs,  including  operations  and maintenance, and they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.\n\nEight indirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have an ownership interest ranging from approximately 50% to 67% in entities which own and operate solar facilities with the capability of producing a total of approximately 772 MW. Each of the subsidiaries is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates ranging from 2035 through 2052. These entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $1,851 million and $1,258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. There were three of these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2020, and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $751 million and $607 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.\n\nNEE consolidates a NEET VIE that is constructing an approximately 280-mile electricity transmission line. A  NEET subsidiary is  the  primary beneficiary  and  controls  the  most  significant  activities  during  the  construction  period,  including  controlling  the  construction  budget.  NEET  is entitled to receive 50% of the profits and losses of the entity. The assets and liabilities of the VIE totaled approximately $614 million and $64 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $423 million and $68 million,",

These entities sell their electric output under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2025 through 2040. These entities are also considered a VIE because the holders of differential membership interests in these entities do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. The assets and liabilities of the VIE were approximately $1,518 million and $79 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $1,572 million and $393 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020.

These entities sell, or will sell, their electric output either under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2024 through 2053 or in the spot market. These entities are considered VIEs because the holders of differential membership interests do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. NextEra Energy Resources has financing obligations with respect to these entities, including third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the other  assets  of  these  entities  or  by  pledges  of  NextEra  Energy  Resources'  ownership  interest  in  these  entities.  The  debt  holders  have  no recourse to the general credit of NEER for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs totaled approximately $17,419 million and  $1,480  million,  respectively,  at  December  31,  2021,  and  $16,180  million  and  $1,741  million,  respectively  at  December  31,  2020.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and accounts payable. At December 31, 2021, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of two of these consolidated VIEs.\n\nOther - At December 31, 2021 and 2020, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $4,559 million ($3,799 million at FPL) and  $3,704  million  ($3,124  million  at  FPL),  respectively,  which  are  included  in  special  use  funds  and  noncurrent  other  assets  on  NEE's consolidated  balance  sheets  and  in  special  use  funds  on  FPL's  consolidated  balance  sheets.  These  investments  represented  primarily commingled funds and mortgage-backed securities.  NEE  subsidiaries,  including  FPL,  are  not  the  primary  beneficiaries  and  therefore  do  not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not involved in the initial design of these entities and do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities.\n\nCertain  subsidiaries  of  NEE  have  noncontrolling  interests  in  entities  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method,  including  NEE's  noncontrolling interest  in  NEP  OpCo  (see  Note  8).  These  entities  are  limited  partnerships  or  similar  entity  structures  in  which  the  limited  partners  or  nonmanaging members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered VIEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE's investment in these entities totaled approximately $4,214 million and $3,932 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $110 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 - Commitments and - Contracts, respectively.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to purchased power agreements, land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to three land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to 20 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. At December 31, 2021, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $547 million and $555 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2020 were $535 million and $541 million. At December 31, 2021, NEE's  ROU  assets  and  lease  liabilities  for  finance  leases  totaled  approximately  $205  million  and  $200  million,  respectively;  the  respective amounts at December 31, 2020 were $128 million and $124 million. NEE's lease liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.57% and 3.81%, respectively, for operating leases and 3.52% and 3.50%, respectively, for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 39 years and 33 years, respectively, for operating leases and 31 years and 25 years, respectively, for finance leases. At December 31, 2021, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $1.4 billion with no one year being material. NEE's operating lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled approximately $92 million, $95 million and $91 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,",

      "question": "How does NextEra Energy's (NEE) financial treatment of its stake in NextEra Energy Partners (NEP), including convertible notes and equity dilution risks, align with its operational strategy of selling generating assets to NEP and third parties, and how is the relationship between NEE and NEP formally defined in the company's organizational structure?",
      "answer": "NEE holds a stake in NEP and faces potential equity dilution through NEP's senior unsecured convertible notes, which were issued in amounts of $500 million in June 2021 and $600 million in December 2020. These notes can be converted into NEP common units, which could dilute NEE's ownership stake. Operationally, NEE has sold approximately 468 MW of generating assets to NEP and third parties in 2021, indicating a strategic movement of assets into NEP. This relationship is formally recognized in NEE\u2019s organizational structure, where NEP is explicitly defined as 'NextEra Energy Partners, LP' in the glossary, underscoring its role as a key partner in NEE's broader asset management and capital strategy.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Southern Company's audit treatment of regulatory rate changes across its Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama subsidiaries reveals a consistent framework for evaluating regulatory exposure, but with jurisdiction-specific nuances. In all three cases, management assessed the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed or under-construction plant, and (3) potential refunds to customers. However, the audit procedures emphasized different regulatory orders and precedents in each state, indicating that the likelihood assessments were influenced by regional regulatory precedents. For example, Mississippi Power's disclosures focused on the subjectivity in assessing future regulatory orders' impact on incurred costs, Georgia Power emphasized the completeness and accuracy of regulatory assets/liabilities recorded during the year, and Alabama Power highlighted management's representations regarding refund likelihood and future rate reductions. This suggests that while the core assumptions are consistent, the application and risk profile vary by jurisdiction based on historical regulatory behavior.",

      "answer": "Southern Company defines Southern Nuclear in the glossary (page 7) as a wholly-owned subsidiary responsible for operating nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. In the financial statements (page 164), Southern Nuclear is listed among key subsidiaries, with its services tied directly to nuclear plant operations and cost allocations. The affiliate transactions section (page 165) reveals that Southern Nuclear provides nuclear-related services to Alabama Power and Georgia Power at cost, with 2024 expenses totaling $260 million and $835 million respectively. This structured cost recovery model aligns with Southern Company's broader regulated utility framework, where costs are passed through to operating companies without profit markup. Together, these perspectives indicate that Southern Nuclear functions as a centralized, cost-based service provider for nuclear operations, reinforcing the company's integrated approach to managing capital-intensive assets across the system.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

          "chunk_text": "\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power also have agreements with Southern Nuclear under which Southern Nuclear renders the following nuclear-related services at cost: general executive and advisory services; general operations, management, and technical services; administrative services including procurement, accounting, employee relations, systems, and procedures services; strategic planning and budgeting services; and other services with respect to business and operations. These costs are primarily included in other operations and maintenance expenses or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment. Costs for these services in 2024, 2023, and 2022 amounted to $260 million, $251 million, and $267 million, respectively, for Alabama Power and $835 million, $899 million, and $895 million, respectively, for Georgia Power.\n\nCost allocation methodologies used by SCS and Southern Nuclear prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, were approved by the SEC. Subsequently, additional cost allocation methodologies have been reported to the FERC and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be rendered at cost by system service companies.\n\nAlabama Power's and Georgia Power's power purchases from affiliates through the Southern Company power pool are included in purchased power, affiliates on their respective statements of income. Mississippi Power's and Southern Power's power purchases from affiliates through the Southern Company power pool are included in purchased power on their respective statements of income and were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's issuance and conversion terms of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes relate to their equity dilution impact and forward sale contracts, particularly in light of the settlement mechanics and conversion thresholds?",
      "answer": "Southern Company issued $1.5 billion of Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes in May 2024 with an initial conversion rate of 10.8166 shares per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to $92.45 per share), which could result in equity dilution if converted above the principal amount. However, in 2024, there was no dilution from these notes due to the conversion settlement structure, which allows Southern Company to pay cash up to the principal amount and deliver shares, cash, or a combination for the excess. Additionally, Southern Company entered into forward sale contracts in late 2024 for over 2.5 million shares at prices ranging from $83.33 to $87.97 per share, which may be used to hedge or offset potential dilution from conversions. The conversion is also conditional, requiring the stock price to exceed 130% of the conversion price in specific trading windows, limiting the likelihood of conversion unless the stock appreciates significantly.",

Compliance costs incurred were $300 million and $265 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively, and are ex pected to be $330 million in 2025. The CCR ARO costs are expected to be revised for actual ex penditures and updated estimates through future annual compliance filings.\n\nFurther, under the 2022 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.50% and its equity ratio is set at 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of 9.50% to 11.90%. Any retail earnings above 11.90% will be shared, with 40% being applied to reduce regulatory assets, 40% directly refunded to customers, and the remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below 9.50% on an actual basis. However, if at any time during the term of the 2022 ARP, Georgia Power projects that its retail earnings will be below 9.50% for any calendar year, it may petition the Georgia PSC for implementation of the Interim Cost Recovery (ICR) tariff to adjust Georgia Power's retail rates to achieve a 9.50% ROE. The Georgia PSC would have 90 days to rule on Georgia Power's request. The ICR tariff would expire at the earlier of January 1, 2026 or the end of the calendar year in which the ICR tariff becomes effective. In lieu of requesting implementation of an ICR tariff, or if the G eorgia PSC chooses not to implement the ICR tariff, G eorgia Power may file a full rate case. In 2023 and 2024, G eorgia Power's retail ROE was within the allowed retail ROE range.\n\nGeorgia Power is required to file a general base rate case by July 1, 2025, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2022 ARP should be continued, modified, or discontinued.\n\n## 2019 ARP\n\nGeorgia Power's retail ROE under the 2019 ARP was set at 10.50% and earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range of 9.50% to 12.00%. Any retail earnings above 12.00% were shared, with 40% applied to reduce regulatory assets, 40% directly refunded to customers, and the remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. In 2022, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by $117 million and refunded $117 million to customers through bill credits in the first quarter 2023.\n\n## Integrated Resource Plans\n\n## 2022 IRP\n\nIn 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC.\n\nIn the 2022 IRP decision, the Georgia PSC approved, among other things, the certification of six PPAs (including five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power that are subject to approval by the FERC) with capacities of 1,567 MWs beginning in 2024, 380 MWs beginning in 2025, and 228 MWs beginning in 2028, procured through a capacity request for proposals (RFP) authorized in the 2019 IRP. On June 27, 2024, the FERC approved the five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power. See Note 9 for additional information.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction of a 265-MW battery energy storage facility, which is projected to be placed in service in 2026, as authorized in the 2022 IRP. G eorgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports with the G eorgia PSC through commercial operation. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\nAs included in the 2022 IRP final order, Georgia Power initiated an RFP of up to 8,500 MWs of capacity from a variety of resources with expected CODs or delivery commencement dates between 2028 and 2030. The RFP included Georgia Power-owned proposals. In conjunction with those proposals, Georgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction through January 2025. Winning participants are expected to be notified in June 2025, and the Georgia PSC is anticipated to render a decision related to the certification of the winning submissions in the fourth quarter 2025. Depending on the outcomes of the RFP and certification processes, Georgia Power could spend up to $14 billion, excluding AFUDC, on approved Georgia Power-owned proposals and related transmission investments through 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2023 IRP Update\n\nOn April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors (2023 IRP Update), which set forth a plan to support the recent increase in",

In addition, Southern Power continued construction of the 200-MW first phase and began construction of the 180-MW second phase and the 132-MW third phase of the Millers Branch solar facility with commercial operation projected to occur in the fourth quarter 2025, the second quarter 2026, and the fourth quarter 2026, respectively. Upon completion, the Millers Branch solar project will have a total generating capacity of 512 MWs, substantially all of which is contracted under multiple PPAs ranging from 15 years to 20 years.\n\nIn November 2024, Southern Power committed to a development project to repower 200 MWs of the 299-MW Kay Wind facility. The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years.\n\nSee Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for additional information.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn June 2023, the Illinois Commission concluded its review of the Qualifying Infrastructure Plant (QIP) capital investments by Nicor Gas for calendar year 2019 under the QIP rider, also referred to as Investing in Illinois program. The Illinois Commission disallowed $32 million of the $415 million of capital investments commissioned in 2019, together with the related return on investment. Nicor Gas recorded a pre-tax charge to income in the second quarter 2023 of $38 million ($28 million after tax ) associated with the disallowance of capital investments placed in service in 2019. The disallowance is reflected on the statement of income as an $8 million reduction to revenues and $30 million in estimated loss on regulatory disallowance. On August 3, 2023, the Illinois Commission denied a rehearing request filed by Nicor Gas. On August 24, 2023, Nicor Gas filed a notice of appeal with the Illinois Appellate Court. On November 25, 2024, the Illinois Appellate Court agreed with the Illinois Commission's review of the QIP capital investments by Nicor Gas for calendar year 2019 under the QIP rider apart from one immaterial item. On December 24, 2024, Nicor Gas filed a petition for leave to appeal $14 million of the 2019 QIP disallowance with the Illinois Supreme Court. Nicor Gas defends these investments in infrastructure as prudently incurred.\n\nIn connection with Nicor Gas' 2023 general base rate case proceeding, the Illinois Commission disallowed $126.8 million of capital investments that have been completed or were planned to be completed through December 31, 2024. This includes $31 million for capital investments placed in service in 2022 and 2023 under the Investing in Illinois program and $95.9 million for other transmission and distribution capital investments. Nicor Gas recorded a pre-tax  charge to income in the fourth quarter 2023 of $58 million ($44 million after tax ) associated with the disallowances, with the remaining $69 million related to prospective projects that will be postponed and/or reevaluated. The disallowance is reflected on the statement of income in estimated loss on regulatory disallowance. On January 3, 2024, the Illinois Commission denied a request by Nicor Gas for rehearing on the base rate case disallowances associated with capital investment, as well as on other issues determined in the Illinois Commission's November 2023 base rate case decision. On February 6, 2024, Nicor Gas filed a notice of appeal with the Illinois Appellate Court related to the Illinois Commission's rate case ruling.\n\nAny further cost disallowances by the Illinois Commission in the pending cases and the 2020 through 2023 annual review proceedings could be material to the financial statements of Southern Company Gas. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects - Nicor Gas\" for additional information.\n\nOn January 3, 2025, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $309 million increase in annual base rate revenues. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2026, an ROE of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54.6%. The Illinois Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.",

During the second quarter 2024, following Unit 4's inservice date, Southern Nuclear evaluated the remaining expected site demobilization costs and other contractor obligations and reduced the remaining estimate to complete forecast by approximately $21 million, including the impact of joint owner cost-sharing. Accordingly, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax credit to income of approximately $21 million ($16 million after tax ), including the joint owner agreement impacts, in the second quarter 2024 to recognize forecasted capital costs previously charged to income. Georgia Power's share of the remaining project capital cost forecast, including completion of site demobilization and remaining contractor obligations, is $69 million. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\" for additional information.\n\n## Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Regulatory Matters\n\nIn December 2023, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's application to adjust rates to include reasonable and prudent Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 costs as modified by the related stipulation (Prudency Stipulation) among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors.\n\nGeorgia Power included in retail rate base $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as $647 million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues increased approximately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately 5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.\n\nFurther, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024. Effective May 1, 2024, following commercial operation for Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters\" for additional information.\n\n## Rate Plans\n\nOn December 17, 2024, in accordance with the terms of the 2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved tariff adjustments effective January 1, 2025 that resulted in a net increase in rates of $306 million. G eorgia Power is required to file its nex t general base rate case by July 1, 2025. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"G eorgia Power - Rate Plans - 2022 ARP\" for additional information.\n\n## Integrated Resource Plans\n\nAs included in the 2022 IRP final order, Georgia Power initiated a request for proposals (RFP) of up to 8,500 MWs of capacity from a variety of resources with expected CODs or delivery commencement dates between 2028 and 2030.

The 2023 IRP Update includes the authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs.

      "question": "How has NextEra Energy's allocation to U.S. Government and municipal bonds evolved across its fair value hierarchy and special use funds, and what does this indicate about its liquidity strategy and risk management approach?",
      "answer": "In the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023, NextEra Energy held $101 million in U.S. Government and municipal bonds, with $96 million categorized under Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets) and $5 million under Level 2 (significant other observable inputs), as disclosed on page 100. This compares to $90 million in 2022, with $85 million in Level 1 and $5 million in Level 2, showing a modest increase in exposure to these fixed-income instruments. On page 87, the special use funds breakdown reveals a more significant allocation: NEE held $700 million in Level 1 and $57 million in Level 2 U.S. Government and municipal bonds, totaling $757 million. This indicates that while the broader fair value portfolio maintains a conservative position in these assets, the special use funds reflect a more substantial, strategic allocation. The concentration in Level 1 within special use funds suggests a focus on high-liquidity instruments to support operational flexibility, while the minimal Level 2 exposure in the overall fair value hierarchy reflects a cautious approach to valuation risk.",

      "question": "How has the composition and valuation of NEE's Special Use Funds changed between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of equity securities and debt instruments, and what does this shift suggest about NEE's investment strategy or risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's Special Use Funds included $4,437 million in equity securities, $704 million in U.S. Government and municipal bonds, $722 million in corporate debt securities, $615 million in asset-backed securities, and $20 million in other debt securities. By 2023, the equity securities increased to $5,290 million, U.S. Government and municipal bonds rose to $757 million, corporate debt securities decreased slightly to $623 million, asset-backed securities increased to $822 million, and other debt securities were $20 million. This indicates a significant increase in equity and asset-backed securities, suggesting a strategic shift toward higher-risk, higher-return assets, while maintaining a stable position in government-backed instruments. The increase in Level 1 and Level 2 valuations also implies improved market transparency or repositioning of the portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE (page_86) \u2192 Special Use Funds: Discloses that Special Use Funds include debt and equity securities, valued using market approaches and pricing validations, with a focus on fair value measurement techniques.",

        "Hop 3: NEE (page_88) \u2192 Special Use Funds: Offers 2022 comparative data, revealing the baseline composition and allowing for trend analysis of NEE's investment positioning over time."

      "question": "How does NextEra Energy's strategy of investing in new solar generation facilities align with its pattern of selling existing solar assets, and what does this reveal about its revenue recognition and capital deployment priorities?",
      "answer": "NextEra Energy demonstrates a dual strategy of actively investing in new solar generation facilities, as evidenced by the $390 million in new investment revenues reported on page_40, while simultaneously divesting existing solar assets, such as the 2023 sale of three solar facilities totaling 688 MW (page_78) and the 2021 sale of six solar facilities with 2,520 MW of capacity (page_79). These disposals generated $566 million and $1.7 billion in proceeds, respectively, and resulted in gains of $301 million (after tax: $230 million) and $53 million (after tax: $33 million). This pattern suggests that NEE strategically monetizes mature solar assets to redeploy capital into new projects, maintaining growth in clean energy while managing its balance sheet. The revenue recognition practices show that new investments contribute directly to operating revenues, while asset sales generate gains and contract liabilities that are later reversed upon commercial operation, aligning with a capital recycling model that supports both short-term financial performance and long-term clean energy expansion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NEE](page_40) \u2192 [Solar Generation Facilities]: Reports $390 million in new investment revenues from solar generation facilities, indicating active investment and operational growth in this segment.",

      "question": "How does NextEra Energy's financial performance and strategic positioning around wind generation facilities reflect both growth and divestiture activities across different reporting periods, particularly considering new investments, revenue impacts, and asset sales?",
      "answer": "NextEra Energy's financial performance and strategic positioning around wind generation facilities reflects a dual approach of growth through new investments and revenue contributions, while also selectively divesting assets to optimize capital allocation. In 2023, NEER reported increased earnings driven by new wind and solar generation facilities that entered service post-2022, contributing $390 million in new investment revenues. However, existing clean energy assets saw a $371 million decline in revenues, primarily due to lower wind resource availability. Meanwhile, the company executed multiple asset sales in 2023 and 2022, including a $566 million sale of five wind facilities in June 2023 and a $805 million sale of wind and solar facilities in December 2022. These transactions generated gains of $301 million and $94 million respectively, indicating a strategic reallocation of capital while maintaining operational control post-sale. This dynamic shows a balanced strategy of expanding wind generation capacity through development while monetizing mature assets to drive overall portfolio efficiency.",

        "Hop 1: [NEE](page_40) \u2192 Wind Generation Facilities: New wind and solar facilities entering service post-2022 contributed $390 million in new investment revenues in 2023, while existing wind assets saw a $371 million revenue decline due to lower wind resource.",
        "Hop 2: [NEE](page_79) \u2192 Wind Generation Facilities: In 2021, NEE sold a portfolio of seven wind and six solar facilities totaling 2,520 MW, recognizing a $53 million loss, and also sold additional wind and solar facilities in the West and Midwest for $563 million, recording a $94 million gain.",
        "Hop 3: [NEE](page_78) \u2192 Wind Generation Facilities: In 2023, NEE sold five wind and three solar facilities for $566 million, and in December 2022, sold three wind and one solar facility for $805 million, recognizing gains of $301 million and $230 million after tax, respectively."

      "question": "What does NEE's use of guaranteed, remarketable subordinated debt instruments like the Series L Debentures reveal about their capital structure strategy, particularly in terms of liquidity management and shareholder equity optimization?",
      "answer": "NEE's use of guaranteed, remarketable subordinated debt instruments like the Series L Debentures reveals a deliberate capital structure strategy aimed at balancing liquidity management with shareholder equity optimization. On page 118, we see that the Series L Debentures were created in September 2020 with a maturity date of September 1, 2025, indicating a medium-term debt instrument that can be remarketed to adjust interest rates based on prevailing market conditions. On page 104, we learn that NEE fully and unconditionally guarantees these debentures, which enhances their creditworthiness and likely lowers borrowing costs. The August 2023 remarketing of $2.0 billion of Series L Debentures reset the interest rate to 5.749%, aligning the cost of capital with current market rates. This remarketing mechanism gives NEE flexibility to manage interest expenses over time. Furthermore, the settlement of the September 2020 equity units involved the issuance of 27.3 million shares of NEE common stock in exchange for $2.0 billion, demonstrating how NEE structures its debt instruments to ultimately convert them into equity, thereby strengthening its balance sheet by reducing leverage over time. On page 120, the Series L Junior Subordinated Debentures due September 29, 2057, filed as Exhibit 4(ccc), show that NEE also uses long-dated subordinated instruments to further optimize capital structure, likely for regulatory capital treatment and long-term financing needs. Together, these elements reveal a layered capital strategy that uses guaranteed, remarketable instruments to manage near-to-medium-term liquidity while strategically converting debt into equity and maintaining long-dated subordinated instruments for regulatory and structural flexibility.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's treatment of the Series 2023A Convertible Senior Notes in the diluted EPS calculation reconcile with the conversion terms and the shares reserved for issuance related to these notes?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's diluted EPS calculation for 2023 shows no dilution from the Series 2023A Convertible Senior Notes, despite the notes being convertible at a rate of 11.8818 shares per $1,000 principal amount. This aligns with the fact that no conversions occurred during the year, as noted in the financial statements. However, the company has reserved 131 million shares for issuance, including those related to the Series 2023A Notes, indicating potential future dilution if conversions take place. Thus, while there is no current dilution impact for 2023, the reserved shares and conversion mechanics suggest that dilution could occur in future periods depending on market conditions and holder decisions.",

In the detailed regulatory asset table (page_149), the ARO for coal ash is valued at $1,389 million in 2021, with a note indicating it 'Earns/Pays a Return'\u2014suggesting it is part of a rate-regulated mechanism. However, in the second regulatory table (page_154), a separate coal ash ARO of $33 million is disclosed for 2021, also marked as 'Earns/Pays a Return', but significantly smaller\u2014indicating a regional or subsidiary-level distinction. This implies that coal ash obligations are being managed differently across jurisdictions or entities, with varying recovery treatments and financial impacts, adding complexity to Duke's regulatory and financial planning.",

      "question": "How does the $41 million regulatory asset classification for Customer Connect in 2021 relate to Duke Energy's customer satisfaction strategy and the changes in internal control over financial reporting following its SAP-based implementation?",
      "answer": "The $41 million regulatory asset for Customer Connect in 2021 reflects Duke Energy's strategic investment in modernizing customer systems, as noted in the financial disclosures. This aligns with the company's broader customer satisfaction strategy outlined in the MD&A section, where Customer Connect was highlighted as a key initiative to consolidate legacy billing systems and improve the customer experience across jurisdictions. The implementation of Customer Connect also triggered modifications to internal controls, as detailed in the Controls and Procedures section, where Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida implemented the SAP-based system in Q4 2021, requiring adjustments to internal controls to ensure accurate financial reporting. Together, these perspectives show that Customer Connect was not only a financial asset but also a strategic and operational transformation that required governance adjustments to support both customer experience and financial integrity.",

          "chunk_text": "## MD&amp;A\n\nRecognizing the continued importance of natural gas to our plans, we continue to work toward a net-zero methane emission goal by 2030 related to our natural gas distribution business. In August 2021, we announced a partnership with Accenture and Microsoft to develop a novel technology platform with the intent of measuring baseline methane emissions from natural gas distribution systems with a high level of accuracy in near real time. Once deployed, we expect the use of satellite technology and the new platform will increase the speed of a field response team's ability to identify and repair methane leaks along distribution lines and systems.\n\nConstructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes . One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in our jurisdictions. Modernized constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. As highlighted above, House Bill 951 provides the framework for many of these benefits in North Carolina under the direction of the NCUC. Also, in October 2021, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) received clearance from the FERC. The new SEEM platform will facilitate sub-hourly, bilateral trading, allowing participants to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. Southeastern electricity customers are expected to see cost, reliability and environmental benefits.\n\nIn 2021, we received constructive rate case orders related to our 2019 North Carolina rate cases for both Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and also reached constructive settlement agreements in our natural gas businesses in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee. In October 2021, Duke Energy Ohio filed a request to review the company's electric distribution rates. We have a multiyear rate plan in Florida and in January 2021, we reached a constructive settlement agreement with key consumer groups to bring additional certainty to rates through 2024. In addition, grid investment riders in the Midwest and Florida enable more timely cost recovery and earnings growth.\n\nCustomer Satisfaction . Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are the most important to the customer experience. We successfully implemented the first three jurisdictional releases of Customer Connect, a new system that consolidates four legacy billing systems into one customer-service platform, allowing us to deliver the universal experience customers expect. Our work has been recognized by our customers and we have maintained our above-target performance throughout the year, despite the resumption of standard billing and payment practices in most jurisdictions.\n\nOperational Excellence, Safety and Reliability . The reliable and safe operation of our power plants, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities is foundational to our customers, our financial results and our credibility with stakeholders. Our regulated generation fleet and nuclear sites had strong performance throughout the year and our electric distribution system performed well. The safety of our workforce is a core value. Our employees delivered strong safety results in 2021, and we are at or near the top of our industry.\n\nStorm activity was limited in our regulated service territories in 2021, but we supported Entergy Louisiana, sending approximately 500 workers to aid in restoring power after Hurricane Ida. The February winter storm in Texas adversely impacted Duke Energy Renewables' operations. In addition to operating at reduced capacity, we were required to purchase power at scarcity pricing levels to meet fixed volume commitments. Enterprisewide lessons learned were formed immediately following the Texas weather event to identify opportunities to ensure readiness for extreme weather. Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2021 storm response efforts, including navigating ongoing COVID-19 protocols, is a testament to our team's extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and to on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts. Duke Energy has received over 20 Emergency Response Awards since EEI began recognizing storm response in 1998 (including eight for assisting other utilities, and eight in our service territories over the last decade).\n\nLeading Through COVID-19 . COVID-19 continued to impact all that we accomplished in 2021 and demonstrated our resiliency and agility:\n\n- In addition to achieving financial results in the upper half of our original guidance, we have continued our cost-management journey - focused on driving productivity, increasing flexibility and prioritizing spend based on risk and strategic value to our customers and investors. In 2021, we maintained approximately $200 million of O&amp;M savings identified during the earliest days of the pandemic. We also have successfully navigated supply chain challenges and the impacts of inflation. Our procurement teams have created action plans to enhance planning, augment supply, amend operations and leverage our scale to mitigate these risks to the extent possible.\n- Duke Energy kept electricity and natural gas flowing while continuing to voluntarily make significant accommodations for our customers. To continue to support our customers, we extended the COVID-19 payment flexibility policies we developed in 2020 without compromising our financial performance. We extended payment arrangements for new arrearages, modified reconnection policies and increased the time customers had to restructure agreements. We analyzed each state's regulatory environment to identify additional state-specific solutions. To better connect customers to federal and state assistance dollars: a dedicated Agency team was created to help local customer assistance agencies in making pledges for Duke Energy customers; a small team was established to work directly with state and federal agencies; and a team of 'payment navigators' was piloted to work directly with customers to connect them with available assistance dollars in their local communities.\n- We implemented safety procedures designed to provide physical safety for our workers and provided support for our employees. Throughout the year, we aligned with local, state, and federal policies on COVID-19 protocols.\n- In May, we announced that the Duke Energy Plaza, a 40-floor office tower currently under construction in Uptown Charlotte, will become the company's new corporate headquarters, allowing us to reduce occupied space in the Charlotte area by approximately 60% to optimize our real estate footprint. We've rolled out our new hybrid workplace model (WorkSmart) with about 85% of our office-based workforce working in the WorkSmart model. The WorkSmart team has prepared our buildings to ensure employees return to work safely and have put in place the tools and technologies needed to ensure the most effective transition.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2021, and, based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida implemented Customer Connect, an SAP based customer engagement and billing solution. Customer Connect was previously implemented at Duke Energy Carolinas during the second quarter of 2021. As a result of this implementation, we modified certain existing internal controls and implemented new controls and procedures related to Customer Connect. We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of these internal controls and do not believe this implementation had an adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and other than with respect to the Customer Connect SAP implementation, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Duke Energy Registrants' internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with GAAP. Due to inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' management, including their Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the framework in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2021.\n\nDeloitte &amp; Touche LLP, Duke Energy's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke Energy's internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. This report is not applicable to the Subsidiary Registrants as these companies are not accelerated or large accelerated filers.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy's 50% equity ownership in Hardy Storage, a FERC-regulated interstate natural gas storage facility in West Virginia, reflects a strategic focus on securing reliable, regulated infrastructure to support its broader gas distribution and procurement strategy. This aligns with Piedmont\u2019s operational role as the entity directly contracting for long-term storage and transportation services, as seen in its inclusion of Hardy Storage-related expenses in 'Cost of natural gas' on its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Financially, Duke Energy received $50 million in equity investment distributions in 2023, which suggests active capital management and return generation from such regulated assets. Hardy Storage's FERC oversight ensures a stable regulatory framework, consistent with Duke\u2019s investments in other FERC-regulated facilities like Pine Needle, and supports its goal of assured supply and capacity release flexibility under regulatory mechanisms.

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's use of trend analyses for regulatory asset balances relate to their audit approach for asset retirement obligations and deferred costs?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy utilizes trend analyses as part of their audit procedures to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances, as seen in all three sections. Specifically, auditors independently compared recorded regulatory asset balances to expectations derived from trend analyses to assess recoverability. For asset retirement obligations, such as those related to coal ash costs, auditors performed additional procedures including obtaining internal legal counsel letters and management analyses to evaluate the probability of recovery for costs not yet addressed in regulatory orders. Similarly, for deferred costs like fuel and storm costs, substantive analytical procedures were applied to assess their recoverability. This consistent use of trend analyses across different asset categories supports the broader audit framework for assessing regulatory asset recoverability and enhances the credibility of management's assertions about these balances in financial reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(page_102) \u2192 Trend Analyses: Auditors used trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances and compared recorded balances to independently developed expectations.",
