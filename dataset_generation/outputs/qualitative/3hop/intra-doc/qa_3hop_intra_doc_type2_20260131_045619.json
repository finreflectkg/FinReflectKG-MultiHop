      "answer": "Union Pacific emphasizes non-GAAP measures such as adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA (3.8% incremental borrowing rate on operating leases at year-end), cash flow conversion, and free cash flow ($2.8 billion in 2024) as key tools for assessing financial health and operational efficiency. These metrics are framed as important to both management and investors, with adjusted debt to EBITDA used by rating agencies for credit evaluation, cash flow conversion reflecting operational strength tied to union labor agreements, and free cash flow underscoring the company\u2019s ability to fund dividends and manage growth without external financing. Together, they present a strategy centered on strong cash generation, disciplined capital allocation, and transparency in investor communication, while acknowledging the non-standardized nature of these measures under SEC Regulation G.",

        "Hop 2: [UNP](page_32) \u2192 [SEC Regulation G]: Cash flow conversion is also labeled a non-GAAP measure under Regulation G, with the 2024 increase attributed to higher net income and the resolution of 2023 labor-related payments.",

In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when rev iewing the Company's  credit  rating. Adjusted  debt  to  adjusted  EBITDA  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  rather  than  as  a  substitute  for,  other  information prov ided in accordance with GAAP.

It is not unusual for us to hav e a working capital deficit,  and  we  believ e  it  is  not  an  indication  of  a  lack  of  liquidity.

Additionally, Union Pacific has $609 million in future minimum lease payments for freight cars and other assets through variable interest entities (VIEs), which are not consolidated on the balance sheet.

Under  our  shelf  registration,  we  may  issue,  from  time  to  time,  any  combination  of  debt  securities,  preferred  stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. The Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to $9.0 billion of debt securities, replacing the prior Board authorization in February 2022, which had $5.6 billion of authority remaining.\n\nDuring the year ended  December 31, 2024, we did not issue any debt securities under this registration statement. At  December 31, 2024, we had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to issue up to $9.0 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration.\n\nReceivables Securitization Facility - As  of  both  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  we  recorded  $0  of  borrowings  under  our  Receiv ables  Facility,  as secured debt.

As such, we hav e no control ov er activ ities that could materially impact the fair v alue of the leased assets. We do not hold the power to direct the activ ities of the VIEs and, therefore, do not control the ongoing activ ities that hav e a significant impact on the economic performance of the VIEs. Additionally,  we  do  not  hav e  the  obligation  to  absorb  losses  of  the  VIEs  or  the  right  to  receiv e  benefits  of  the  VIEs  that  could  potentially  be significant to the VIEs.\n\nWe are not considered to be the primary beneficiary  and  do  not  consolidate  these  VIEs  because  our  actions  and  decisions  do  not  hav e  the  most significant effect on the VIE's performance and our fixed-price purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the VIEs.

      "answer": "Union Pacific highlights adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA as a key metric for evaluating its ability to manage debt levels, including leases and pension obligations, with cash generated from operations. This measure is used by rating agencies and is critical to assessing creditworthiness. In the operating activities section, the company emphasizes cash flow conversion, which reflects how efficiently operating income translates into cash after capital investments\u2014showing improvement due to higher net income and lower labor-related outflows. Finally, free cash flow, discussed in the financial results section, shows the company's ability to generate $2.8 billion in cash after reinvestments and dividends, driven by a $384 million benefit from prior-year union wage settlements. Together, these metrics paint a picture of a company managing leverage prudently, improving operational efficiency, and maintaining strong cash generation to support both reinvestment and shareholder returns.",

Non-GAAP adjusted cost per piece is calculated as non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in a period divided by total volume for that period. Because non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses exclude costs or charges that we do not consider a part of underlying business performance when monitoring and evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards, we believe this is the appropriate metric on which to base reviews and evaluations of the efficiency of our operational performance.\n\n## Expense Allocations\n\nCertain operating expenses are allocated between our operating segments using activity-based costing methods. These activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment.

      "question": "How does the divestiture of Coyote impact UPS's financial performance across its Supply Chain Solutions segment, particularly in terms of revenue trends, transportation cost structure, and the resulting capital gain, and what does this suggest about the strategic realignment of the business?",
      "answer": "The divestiture of Coyote significantly influenced UPS's financials in 2024. First, Coyote's exit contributed to a decline in Supply Chain Solutions revenue, with its revenue decreasing by $976 million due to lower volumes and soft market rates, as noted in the segment performance. Second, the divestiture led to a $788 million reduction in purchased transportation costs, a major component of the $51 million overall decrease in third-party transportation expense. Finally, the transaction generated a pretax gain of $156 million ($152 million after tax), which was recognized in Other expenses on the income statement. Together, these effects suggest that UPS strategically exited Coyote to reduce exposure to volatile freight markets and redirect capital toward higher-growth areas like healthcare logistics and digital solutions.",

These reductions were partially offset by growth in Logistics and certain of our other businesses.\n\nWithin our Logistics businesses revenue increased $510 million. The acquisition of MNX Global Logistics in the fourth quarter of 2023 contributed $303 million of the increase, including revenue related to healthcare customers. Revenue in mail services increased $206 million driven by new customer volume and rate increases in the second half of the year. We expect continued growth within our Logistics businesses in 2025, driven by expected growth from our healthcare customers.\n\nWithin our Forwarding businesses, revenue decreased $806 million. Revenue from Coyote decreased $976 million due to lower volumes, continued softness in market rates, and the completion of the divestiture. International airfreight revenue increased $52 million, primarily due to increases in market rates. V olume also grew during the year, particularly on the Asia ex port lanes, driven by growth from e-commerce customers. We expect revenue growth to continue during 2025, driven by improving customer mix. Ocean freight forwarding revenue also increased, driven by an increase in market rates resulting from improved market dynamics as the year progressed, which more than offset lower volumes during the year. We expect revenue growth to continue into 2025 driven by these higher rates.\n\nRevenue from our other businesses within Supply Chain Solutions increased.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n- Other employee benefits expense decreased $174 million due to higher separation costs incurred in 2023. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, other employee benefits expense remained relatively flat.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating expenses exclude the impact of costs incurred under certain of our transformation strategy programs, Fit to Serve and Transformation 2.0, as well as expense related to a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, and primarily impacted other employee benefits expense and related payroll tax  ex pense as discussed above. Compensation and benefit expenses for these items for 2024 were $232 million. These costs decreased by $105 million as compared to 2023. During 2023, non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses excluded costs incurred under certain of our transformation strategy programs, and a onetime compensation payment. See Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability for additional discussion.\n\n## Repairs and Maintenance\n\nRepairs and maintenance expense increased, primarily attributable to a $59 million increase in routine repairs to buildings and facilities. Ex pense also increased for aircraft maintenance, due to the timing of required engine maintenance, and for ground equipment maintenance as a result of increased driving miles.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation expense increased $243 million as a result of facility automation and expansion projects aligned with our strategic objectives. Amortization expense for capitalized software investments increased as a result of further technology investments, and we recorded additional amortization expense for intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns in 2023.\n\n## Purchased Transportation\n\nThird-party transportation expense charged to us by air, ocean and ground carriers decreased by $51 million. The decreases were primarily driven a decrease of $788 million from the disposition of Coyote in September 2024, which also experienced volume declines and lower market rates prior to divestiture.\n\nThis decrease was partly offset by the impact of an increase in delivery costs related to volume growth in our SurePost product ($213 million), the acquisition of MNX Global Logistics ($174 million), volume growth in our mail services business ($146 million) and increases in our healthcare subsidiaries ($106 million) attributable to both volume and rates. The remaining movement within purchased transportation related to increases in expense attributable to market rates in our freight forwarding business ($99 million).\n\n## Fuel\n\nThe decrease in fuel expense was mainly attributable to lower prices for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline, which more than offset ex pense increases driven by volume growth. Market prices and the manner in which we purchase fuel influence our costs. The majority of our fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. While many of the indices are correlated, each index  may respond differently to changes in underlying prices, which in turn can drive variability in our costs.\n\n## Other Occupancy\n\nOther occupancy expense increased, primarily due to increases in property rents. A reduction in certain rebates and increases to temporary structural costs also contributed to the increase.",

      "answer": "UPS achieved $1.0 billion in savings in 2024 through the Fit to Serve initiative by reducing the workforce by approximately 14,000 positions, primarily in management. However, this occurred alongside a $1.4 billion increase in compensation and benefits expense, driven by wage and benefit rate increases for the union workforce under the new IBT contract effective August 1, 2023. This suggests that while UPS is strategically reducing headcount in managerial roles, it is simultaneously increasing compensation for union workers, likely to maintain labor stability and retain critical operational staff. The broader human capital strategy, as outlined in the workforce composition and union agreements, indicates a shift toward a leaner management structure while maintaining strong labor relations with unionized hourly workers, aligning with UPS's long-term operational efficiency goals.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nFit to Serve: In 2023, a number of factors, including macroeconomic headwinds and volume diversion resulting from our labor negotiations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, contributed to volume declines in our U.S. Domestic Package business. In addition, our International Package and Supply Chain Solutions businesses were also negatively impacted by a number of challenging macroeconomic conditions during 2023. In response to these factors, we began to undertake our Fit to Serve initiative with the intent to right-size our business to create a more efficient operating model that was more responsive to market dynamics through a workforce reduction of approximately 14,000 positions, primarily within management, throughout 2024. We have incurred total costs of $416 million under Fit to Serve, which primarily consist of benefit costs related to reductions in our workforce. We expect to complete this initiative during 2025 with ex pected remaining costs of approximately $45 million. We achieved savings of approximately $1.0 billion in 2024 through reductions in our compensation and benefit expense.\n\nNetwork Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined : On January 30, 2025, in connection with our agreement in principle with our largest customer, we announced a network reconfiguration which is expected to lead to consolidations of our facilities and workforce as well as end-to-end process redesign from 2025 through 2027. Our network reconfiguration is expected to result in exit activities that could result in the closure of up to 10% of our buildings in 2025, a reduction in the size of our vehicle and aircraft fleets, and a decrease in the size of our workforce. The costs directly associated with these ex it activities are in addition to operational costs that we may incur. We are not yet able to determine the specific assets or extent of our workforce that will be impacted by our network redesign, the timing of those future changes or the associated charges we will incur and therefore are not currently able to provide an estimate of the total cost or the cost by period. We expect that impacted assets will remain in use during some or all of the periods of our network reconfiguration.\n\nWe expect to partially offset costs to complete our network reconfiguration through end-to-end process redesign carried out during our network reconfiguration through our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives. These initiatives are being undertaken to align our organizational processes to the operational changes expected to occur in our network reconfiguration and drive organizational efficiency. These initiatives are expected to yield approximately $1.0 billion in annualized savings beginning in 2025. We incurred related costs of $35 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect to incur related costs of approximately $300 to $400 million during 2025, and incremental costs in 2026 and 2027, to complete the program which will primarily consist of outside professional services and severance costs. Upon the completion of our network reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined initiatives, we ex pect to realize further benefits in subsequent periods from lower expense, including depreciation, compensation and benefits, as well as lower capital requirements.\n\nWe do not consider the related costs to be ordinary because each program involves separate and distinct activities that may span multiple periods and are not expected to drive incremental revenue, and because the scope of the programs exceeds that of routine, ongoing efforts to enhance profitability. These initiatives are in addition to ordinary, ongoing efforts to enhance our business performance.\n\nFor more information regarding transformation strategy activities, see note 18 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Gain on Divestiture of Coyote\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we completed the previously announced divestiture of Coyote. In connection therewith, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $156 million ($152 million after tax ) during the year ended December 31, 2024. The gain was recognized within Other expenses in the statements of consolidated income. We supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of this gain as it is not a component of our ongoing operations and is not expected to recur. For more information regarding the gain on divestiture of Coyote, see note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## One-Time Payment for International Regulatory Matter\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we made a payment of $94 million of previously restricted cash to settle a previously-disclosed challenge by Italian tax authorities to the deductibility of V alue Added Tax payments by UPS to certain third-party service providers. We supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, interest ex pense, total other income and (ex pense), income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of this payment. We do not believe this is a component of our ongoing operations and we do not expect this or similar payments to recur.",

Our global workforce includes approximately 78,000 management employees (38% of whom are part-time) and 412,000 hourly employees (50% of whom are part-time). More than 75% of our U.S. employees are represented by unions, primarily those employees handling or transporting packages. Many of these employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"Teamsters\"). Our national master agreement with the Teamsters expires on July 31, 2028. In addition, approximately 3,300 of our pilots are represented by the Independent Pilots Association (\"IPA\"). Our agreement with the IPA becomes amendable September 1, 2025. We have approximately 1,900 airline mechanics who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727 which becomes amendable November 1, 2026. In addition, approximately 3,000 of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not represented by the IBT are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\"IAM\"). In July 2024, the IAM ratified a new collective bargaining agreement that will expire on July 31, 2029.\n\nDuring 2024, we executed under our \"Fit to Serve\" initiative, intended to right-size our business and create a more efficient operating model to enhance responsiveness to changing market dynamics. During 2024, we reduced our workforce by approximately 14,000 positions, primarily within management. Fit to Serve is expected to conclude in 2025.\n\nIn January 2025, we announced a reconfiguration of our U.S. network and Efficiency Reimagined initiatives.

Pickup and delivery costs increased $1.1 billion and package sortation costs increased $291 million, slightly offset by a $173 million decrease in the costs of operating our integrated air and ground network, a decrease in other operating costs of $53 million and the impact from one less operating day in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nThe cost increases were primarily due to an increase of $1.4 billion in compensation and benefits expense which was driven by the impact of wage and benefit rate increases for our union workforce under our contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"IBT\"), which became effective August 1, 2023. Thirdparty delivery costs for our SurePost product increased $213 million due to higher SurePost volume.\n\nThe cost decreases were primarily due to a reduction in fuel expense, driven by decreases in the cost of jet and ground fuel, a decrease in worker's compensation expense and the impact of reductions in our workforce under our Fit to Serve initiative.\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, U.S. air cargo operating ex pense is presented within our U.S. Domestic Package segment and prior periods have been recast.\n\nOur non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in this segment exclude the impact of total transformation strategy costs of $147 million, a pre-tax charge to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan of $19 million and asset impairment charges of $5 million. Total transformation strategy costs within the segment during 2024 were related to our Fit to Serve, Transformation 2.0 and Efficiency Reimagined programs. Within these programs, we incurred compensation and benefits costs related to workforce reductions as we right-size our business. Additionally, within Transformation 2.0 and Efficiency Reimagined , we incurred costs related to outside professional service providers. For additional information on these enterprise programs, our expected benefits and the related costs, see 'Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability'.\n\nCost per piece increased 0.6% for the year and non-GAAP adjusted cost per piece increased 0.8%, as expense increases, driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, outpaced growth in average daily volume.

      "question": "What is the full financial and operational impact of UPS's agreement with its largest customer, considering the potential asset impairments, expected network reconfiguration costs, and the anticipated $1.0 billion in annualized savings from Efficiency Reimagined initiatives?",
      "answer": "UPS's agreement with its largest customer is expected to significantly reduce delivery volumes, leading to a reconfiguration of the U.S. network that may result in asset impairments and early retirement charges (as noted on page 85). This reconfiguration is expected to include facility closures, fleet reductions, and workforce decreases, with associated costs estimated between $300 to $400 million in 2025 and additional costs in 2026 and 2027 (from page 24). However, UPS anticipates partially offsetting these costs through its Efficiency Reimagined initiatives, which are projected to yield $1.0 billion in annualized savings starting in 2025 (also from page 24).

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are executing our Customer First, People Led and Innovation Driven strategy to grow in the most attractive parts of the market including healthcare, small and medium-sized businesses ('SMBs') and International.\n\nDuring 2024, we took several steps in furtherance of our strategy. We continued to focus on providing excellent service to our customers, delivering industryleading on-time performance during 2024. Our Digital Access Program grew year over year, contributing to our consolidated volume growth and continued expansion within the United States (\"U.S.\") SMB market. Also in 2024, we executed on our Network of the Future initiatives, which are intended to enhance the efficiency of our network through automation and operational sort consolidation. For example, we are moving from a scanning to a sensing network through our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID initiative, which is helping us reduce manual scans and enhance package visibility for our customers. Additionally, we completed the onboarding of air cargo volumes from the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"). Under our agreement with the USPS, UPS is the primary air cargo provider for the USPS within the United States. Within our international and healthcare operations, we expect to grow both organically and inorganically, having previously announced that we entered into agreements to acquire Estafeta, a leading domestic small package provider in Mexico, and Frigo-Trans, an industry-leading, complex healthcare logistics provider based in Germany. The acquisitions of Frigo-Trans and related entities were completed during January 2025, and the acquisition of Estafeta is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to customary regulatory reviews and approvals. In September 2024, we finalized the previously announced divestiture of our truckload brokerage business (\"Coyote\").\n\nEffective January 1, 2025, we insourced the delivery of all SurePost volume, which we expect to result in additional deliveries within our network. We made this change in order to have greater operational control and maintain the service quality of this product. Also in January 2025, we implemented a 9.9% average rate increase on this product.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, as previously disclosed, we entered into an agreement in principle with our largest customer to significantly reduce the volume we deliver for them. We expect volume from this customer to decline to approximately 50% of year-end 2024 levels by mid-2026. We are making a deliberate shift in our business to increase our focus on growing higher yielding volume. We expect that these actions will result in a reduction in revenue within our U.S. Domestic Package segment, as described below, during 2025 relative to 2024.\n\nIn conjunction therewith, as disclosed on January 30, 2025, we are beginning a network reconfiguration within the U.S. which is expected to lead to consolidations of our facilities and workforce as well as an end-to-end process redesign through 2027. This network reconfiguration, which is an expansion of our Network of the Future program, is expected to result in ex it activities that could result in the closure of up to 10% of our buildings in 2025, a reduction in the size of our vehicle and aircraft fleets, and a decrease in the size of our workforce, which we ex pect will lead to additional ex pense. We are not yet able to determine the specific assets or ex tent of our workforce that will be impacted by this network reconfiguration, the timing of those changes or any associated charges and expenses and therefore are not currently able to provide an estimate of the total cost or the cost by period. We ex pect that impacted assets will remain in use during some or all of the periods of our network reconfiguration.\n\nWe expect to partially offset the anticipated costs associated with this network reconfiguration through our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives. Efficiency Reimagined initiatives are an end-to-end process redesign being undertaken to align our organizational processes to the network reconfiguration. These initiatives are expected to yield approximately $1.0 billion in annualized savings, which we expect to begin realizing during 2025. We incurred related costs of $35 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024. We expect to incur related costs of approximately $300 to $400 million during 2025 and incremental costs in 2026 and 2027 to complete Efficiency Reimagined , primarily relating to outside professional service fees and severance costs.\n\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. As of the fourth quarter of 2024 based on a change in our management reporting structure, U.S. Air Cargo is presented within our U.S. Domestic Package segment and prior periods have been recast. This recast did not have any impact on previously reported consolidated results.\n\nWe experienced volume and revenue growth in our global small package operations during the year, primarily the result of a strong second half of 2024. Within our U.S. Domestic Package operations, we captured growth through additional e-",

For additional information on the expected operational and financial impacts of this agreement, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.\n\n## Competitive Strengths\n\nOur competitive strengths include:\n\nGlobal Smart Logistics Network . We believe that our integrated global air and ground network is the most extensive in the industry. We provide all types of package services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through a single pickup and delivery network that can be configured to meet customers' needs. Our sophisticated systems, including our RFID-enabled Smart Package Smart Facility technology, enable us to optimize network efficiency, asset utilization and enhance end-to-end visibility.\n\nGlobal Presence . We serve more than 200 countries and territories. We have a significant presence in all of the world's major economies, allowing us to effectively and efficiently operate around the world.\n\nCutting-Edge Technologies . We are a global leader in developing technologies that help customers enhance their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency. We offer a variety of digital tools and capabilities that enable customers to integrate UPS functionality into their distribution channels, intended to deepen customer relationships. These tools allow customers to send, manage and track their shipments, and also provide their customers with value-added data about their shipments.\n\nBroad Portfolio of Services . Our service portfolio allows customers of all sizes to choose their most appropriate option. Increasingly, our customers benefit from UPS capabilities and solutions that integrate our services beyond package delivery. We continue to invest in specialized capabilities like our cold chain and thermal monitoring technologies, which we believe allow us to better serve our healthcare customers.\n\nCustomer Relationships . We focus on building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. We believe value-added services beyond package delivery and connecting our small package, supply chain, digital and on-demand services across our customer base, are important to customer retention and growth.\n\nBrand Equity . We have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for service quality, reliability and innovation. Our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.\n\nDistinctive Culture . We believe that the dedication of our employees comes in large part from our strong, purpose-driven culture that fosters trust, partnership and empowerment. We encourage our people to bring their unique perspectives, background, talents and skills to work every day.\n\nFinancial Strength . Our financial strength allows us to continue to pursue strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth. This includes investing in digital technology, acquisitions, transportation equipment, facilities and employee development to generate value for shareholders. We seek to maintain a strong credit rating to give us additional flex ibility in running the business.\n\n## Products and Services; Reporting Segments\n\nWe have two reporting segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. U.S. Domestic Package and International Package are together referred to as our global small package operations.\n\n## Global Small Package\n\nOur global small package operations provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. These services are supported by numerous shipping, visibility and billing technologies including our Digital Access Program, which embeds our shipping solutions directly into leading e-commerce platforms, enabling us to reach SMBs and e-commerce markets more broadly.\n\nWe combine all packages within our single, global network, unless dictated by specific service commitments. This enables efficiently scheduled pick ups for any service level. Our network provides unique operational and capital efficiencies that also have a smaller environmental impact than single service network designs.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n- Other employee benefits expense decreased $174 million due to higher separation costs incurred in 2023. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, other employee benefits expense remained relatively flat.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating expenses exclude the impact of costs incurred under certain of our transformation strategy programs, Fit to Serve and Transformation 2.0, as well as expense related to a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, and primarily impacted other employee benefits expense and related payroll tax  ex pense as discussed above. Compensation and benefit expenses for these items for 2024 were $232 million. These costs decreased by $105 million as compared to 2023. During 2023, non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses excluded costs incurred under certain of our transformation strategy programs, and a onetime compensation payment. See Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability for additional discussion.\n\n## Repairs and Maintenance\n\nRepairs and maintenance expense increased, primarily attributable to a $59 million increase in routine repairs to buildings and facilities. Ex pense also increased for aircraft maintenance, due to the timing of required engine maintenance, and for ground equipment maintenance as a result of increased driving miles.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation expense increased $243 million as a result of facility automation and expansion projects aligned with our strategic objectives. Amortization expense for capitalized software investments increased as a result of further technology investments, and we recorded additional amortization expense for intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns in 2023.\n\n## Purchased Transportation\n\nThird-party transportation expense charged to us by air, ocean and ground carriers decreased by $51 million. The decreases were primarily driven a decrease of $788 million from the disposition of Coyote in September 2024, which also experienced volume declines and lower market rates prior to divestiture.\n\nThis decrease was partly offset by the impact of an increase in delivery costs related to volume growth in our SurePost product ($213 million), the acquisition of MNX Global Logistics ($174 million), volume growth in our mail services business ($146 million) and increases in our healthcare subsidiaries ($106 million) attributable to both volume and rates. The remaining movement within purchased transportation related to increases in expense attributable to market rates in our freight forwarding business ($99 million).\n\n## Fuel\n\nThe decrease in fuel expense was mainly attributable to lower prices for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline, which more than offset ex pense increases driven by volume growth. Market prices and the manner in which we purchase fuel influence our costs. The majority of our fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. While many of the indices are correlated, each index  may respond differently to changes in underlying prices, which in turn can drive variability in our costs.\n\n## Other Occupancy\n\nOther occupancy expense increased, primarily due to increases in property rents. A reduction in certain rebates and increases to temporary structural costs also contributed to the increase.",

The  increase  was  primarily attributable to higher product costs of approximately $560 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $435 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts; $345 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, LRASM and JASSM programs; partially offset by lower product costs of approximately $65 million at Space due to the renationalization of AWE, partially offset by higher volume on hypersonic development, Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) programs.\n\n## Service Costs\n\nService  costs  increased  approximately  $92  million,  or  1%,  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  service  costs  was primarily  due  to  higher  service  costs  of  approximately  $85  million  at Aeronautics  due  to  higher  sustainment  volume  on  F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\n\n## Severance and Restructuring Charges\n\nDuring  2021,  we  recorded  severance  and  restructuring  charges  of  $36  million  ($28  million,  or  $0.10  per  share,  after-tax) associated  with  plans  to  close  and  consolidate  certain  facilities  and  reduce  total  workforce  within  our  RMS  business  segment. During 2020, we recorded severance charges totaling $27 million ($21 million, or $0.08 per share, after-tax) related to the planned elimination of certain positions primarily at our corporate functions.\n\n## Other Unallocated, Net\n\nOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment (which represents the difference between CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations and the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income), stock-based compensation expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.8 billion in 2021,  compared  to  $1.7  billion  in  2020.  Other  unallocated,  net  during  2021  was  higher  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  our FAS/CAS operating adjustment and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.

      "answer": "The Sikorsky helicopter programs contributed $540 million to RMS' net sales increase in 2021 due to higher production volume on programs like Black Hawk, CH-53K, and CRH. This production increase led to a $140 million rise in RMS operating profit, driven by higher risk retirements and lower charges on certain programs. The increased production volume also contributed approximately $560 million to higher product costs within RMS, reflecting the direct relationship between volume and cost of goods sold. Additionally, Lockheed Martin had ongoing capital expenditure projects at RMS specifically to support these Sikorsky programs, indicating strategic investment in infrastructure to sustain and scale production. Together, these factors show that Sikorsky programs were a key growth driver for RMS, positively impacting profitability despite increasing product costs, and were supported by targeted capital investments.",

The  increase  was  primarily attributable to higher product costs of approximately $560 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $435 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts; $345 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, LRASM and JASSM programs; partially offset by lower product costs of approximately $65 million at Space due to the renationalization of AWE, partially offset by higher volume on hypersonic development, Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) programs.\n\n## Service Costs\n\nService  costs  increased  approximately  $92  million,  or  1%,  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  service  costs  was primarily  due  to  higher  service  costs  of  approximately  $85  million  at Aeronautics  due  to  higher  sustainment  volume  on  F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\n\n## Severance and Restructuring Charges\n\nDuring  2021,  we  recorded  severance  and  restructuring  charges  of  $36  million  ($28  million,  or  $0.10  per  share,  after-tax) associated  with  plans  to  close  and  consolidate  certain  facilities  and  reduce  total  workforce  within  our  RMS  business  segment.

Other  unallocated,  net  during  2021  was  higher  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  our FAS/CAS operating adjustment and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.

For  additional information about obligations and our future minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see 'Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit  Plans'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Amounts  related  to  other  liabilities  represent  the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2021. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.\n\nPurchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase  obligations  for  operating  activities  in  the  preceding  table  include  approximately  $52.8  billion  related  to  contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts 'for convenience' under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers.\n\nThe majority of our capital expenditures for 2021 and those planned for 2022 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. The amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2022 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of December 31, 2021 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for  future  periods.  Expenditures  for  equipment  and  facilities  infrastructure  are  generally  incurred  to  support  new  and  existing programs  across  all  of  our  business  segments.  For  example,  we  have  projects  underway  at  Aeronautics  to  support  classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.\n\nWe  also  may  enter  into  industrial  cooperation  agreements,  sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  agreements,  as  a  condition  to obtaining  orders  for  our  products  and  services  from  certain  customers  in  foreign  countries.  These  agreements  are  designed  to enhance  the  social  and  economic  environment  of  the  foreign  country  by  requiring  the  contractor  to  promote  investment  in  the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g. , our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement.

Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated  with  the  customer  relationships,  contracts,  technology  and  trademarks  underlying  the  associated  program.  Intangible assets are amortized over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from five to 20 years.\n\nOur goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit.  Our  goodwill  has  been  allocated  to  and  is  tested  for  impairment  at  a  level  referred  to  as  the  reporting  unit,  which  is  our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine  whether  the  operations  below  the  business  segment  constitute  a  self-sustaining  business  for  which  discrete  financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.\n\nWe may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\n\nFor the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and  market-based  valuation  methodologies  such  as  comparable  public  company  trading  values  and  values  observed  in  recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and  cash  flows  after  considering  factors  such  as  general  market  conditions,  U.S.  Government  budgets,  existing  firm  orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in",

We  also  could  be  adversely  affected  by,  or  liable  for,  actions  taken  by  these  joint  ventures  that  we  do  not  control, including violations of anti-corruption, import and export, taxation and anti-boycott laws.\n\nDepending on our rights and percentage of ownership, we may consolidate the financial results of such entities or account for our interests under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting for nonconsolidated ventures and investments, we recognize our share of the operating profit or loss of these joint ventures in our results of operations. Our operating results are affected  by  the  conduct  and  performance  of  businesses  over  which  we  do  not  exercise  control  and,  as  a  result,  we  may  not  be successful  in  achieving  the  growth  or  other  intended  benefits  of  strategic  investments.  Our  equity  investments  had  the  greatest impact on our Space business segment where approximately 6% of its 2021 operating profit was derived from its share of earnings from equity method investees, primarily that in United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThrough our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make investments in early-stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing  new  technologies  applicable  to  our  core  businesses  and  new  initiatives  important  to  Lockheed  Martin.  These investments may be in the forms of common or preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt securities or investments in funds and are generally illiquid at the time of investment, which limits our ability to exit an investment or realize an investment absent a liquidity  event. Typically,  we  hold  a  non-controlling  interest  and,  therefore,  are  unable  to  influence  strategic  decisions  by  these companies and may have limited visibility into their activities, which may result in our not realizing the intended benefits of the investments. For fund investments, we have even less influence and visibility as a non-controlling investor in a fund that invests in other companies. We may recognize significant gains or losses attributable to adjustments of the investments' fair value, including impairments up to and including the full value of the investment, which can be affected by the success of the companies, market volatility and changes in valuations of our investment holdings.\n\n## Risks  Related  to  Significant  Contingencies,  Uncertainties  and  Estimates,  including  Pension,  Taxes,  Environmental  and Litigation Costs\n\nPension funding and costs are dependent on several economic assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly as well as affect the affordability of our products and services.\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality) and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan funding, cash flow and stockholders' equity.\n\nWith regard to cash flow, we have made substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and expect to make future contributions as required or when deemed prudent. We  generally  can  recover  a  significant  portion  of  these  contributions  related  to  our  plans  as  allowable  costs  on  our  U.S. Government contracts,  including  FMS.  However,  there  is  a  lag  between  the  time  when  we  contribute  cash  to  our  plans  under pension funding rules and when we recover pension costs under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which can affect the timing of our cash flows.\n\nIn recent years, we have taken actions to mitigate the risk related to our defined benefit pension plans through pension risk transfer  transactions  whereby  we  purchase  group  annuity  contracts  (GACs)  from  insurance  companies  using  assets  from  the pension trust and expect to continue to evaluate such transactions in the future. Although under the majority of the GACs we have purchased we are relieved of all responsibility for the associated pension obligations, we have purchased and may in the future purchase GACs whereby the insurance company reimburses the pension plans but we remain responsible for paying benefits under the plans to covered retirees and beneficiaries and are subject to the risk that the insurance company will default on its obligations to reimburse the pension trusts. While we believe pension risk transfer transactions are beneficial, future transactions, depending on their size, could result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period.\n\nFor more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders' equity, see 'Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans' in the MD&amp;A and 'Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The measure increases the debt limit to $31.4 trillion from the previous level of $28.9 trillion and is estimated to provide sufficient government borrowing capacity to last until early 2023.\n\n## International Business\n\nA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening  our  relationships  internationally  through  partnerships  and  joint  technology  efforts.  Our  international  business  is conducted either by foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2021, approximately 69% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 31% were DCS. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers  accounted  for  35%  of  Aeronautics'  net  sales.  There  continues  to  be  strong  international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion  at  our Aeronautics  business  segment  include  the  F-16  and  C-130J  programs,  which  continue  to  draw  interest  from international customers for new aircraft.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers accounted for 29% of MFC's net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide  missile  defense  capabilities.  THAAD  is  an  integrated  system  designed  to  protect  against  high  altitude  ballistic  missile threats. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders for precision fires systems from Germany and Taiwan and for Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) from Australia.\n\nIn 2021, international customers accounted for 28% of RMS' net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production,  modernization,  ship  integration,  test  and  lifetime  support  for  ships  of  international  customers  such  as  Japan,  Spain, Republic  of  Korea,  and  Australia.  We  have  ongoing  combat  systems  programs  associated  with  different  classes  of  surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile, and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom,  the  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia,  Canada,  Singapore,  Australia,  Germany  and  France.  We  have  active  development, production,  and  sustainment  support  of  the  S-70  Black  Hawk\u00ae  and  MH-60  Seahawk\u00ae  helicopters  to  international  customers, including India, Philippines, Australia, Republic of Korea, Thailand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Greece. Additionally, in December 2021,  the  Israeli  Ministry  of  Defense  signed  a  Letter  of  Offer  and Acceptance  (LOA)  to  procure  12  CH-53K  King Stallion heavy lift helicopters. Commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers  accounted  for  8%  of  Space's  net  sales.  The  majority  of  our  Space  business  segment international  sales  in  2021  were  from  our  majority  share  of  AWE  Management  Limited  (AWE),  which  operated  the  United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent program until June 30, 2021. As previously announced, on June 30, 2021 the UK Ministry of Defence renationalized  AWE  and,  accordingly,  the  AWE  program's  ongoing  operations  are  no  longer  included  in  our  financial  results beginning as of that date.\n\n## Status of the F-35 Program\n\nThe  F-35  program  primarily  consists  of  production  contracts,  sustainment  activities,  and  new  development  efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government's current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.",

These  actions  were  taken  to consolidate  certain  operations  in  order  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  RMS'  manufacturing  operations  and  the  affordability  of  its products and services. Employees terminated as part of these actions will receive lump-sum severance payments upon separation primarily based on years of service.\n\nDuring  2020,  we  recognized  severance  charges  totaling  $27  million  ($21  million,  or  $0.08  per  share,  after-tax)  related  to workforce reductions primarily within our corporate functions. These actions were taken to keep our cost structure aligned with our customers' need to improve efficiency and deliver cost savings. Employees terminated as part of these actions received lump-sum severance payments upon separation primarily based on years of service.\n\nEnvironmental matters - We record a liability for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation at a particular site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Our environmental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities, both current and noncurrent. We expect to include a substantial portion of environmental costs in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continuously evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement. We include the portion  of  those  environmental  costs  expected  to  be  allocated  to  our  non-U.S.  Government  contracts,  or  determined  not  to  be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established or adjusted. Our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.\n\nDerivative financial instruments - We record derivatives at their fair value. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair  values  of  derivatives  is  dependent  on  our  intended  use  of  the  derivative  and  its  resulting  designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and  largely  offset  by  corresponding  adjustments  to  the  hedged  items  or  reflected  net  of  income  taxes  in  accumulated  other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings.

Under  existing  U.S.  Government  regulations,  these  and  other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that  are  probable  of  future  recovery  by  assessing,  among  other  factors,  U.S.  Government  regulations,  our  U.S.  Government business  base  and  contract  mix,  our  history  of  receiving  reimbursement  of  such  costs,  and  efforts  by  some  U.S.  Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.\n\nIn addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, the California State Water Resources Control Board, a  branch  of  the  California  Environmental  Protection Agency,  has  indicated  it  will  work  to  re-establish  a  maximum  level  of  the contaminant  hexavalent  chromium  in  drinking  water  after  a  prior  standard  of  10  parts  per  billion  (ppb)  was  challenged  and withdrawn,  and  is  also  reevaluating  its  existing  drinking  water  standard  of  6  ppb  for  perchlorate.  The  U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency decided in June 2020 not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level, although this decision has been challenged, and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.\n\nIf substantially lower standards are adopted for perchlorate (in California) or for hexavalent chromium (in California or at the federal level), we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount  that  would  be  allocable  to  our  non-U.S.  Government  contracts  or  that  is  determined  not  to  be  recoverable  under  U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.\n\nWe also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirements addressing a class of chemicals known generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS have been used ubiquitously, such as in fire-fighting foams, manufacturing  processes,  and  stain-  and  stick-resistant  products  (e.g.,  Teflon,  stain-resistant  fabrics).  Because  we  have  used products  and  processes  over  the  years  containing  some  of  those  compounds,  they  likely  exist  as  contaminants  at  many  of  our environmental remediation sites. Governmental authorities have announced plans, and in some instances have begun, to regulate certain of these compounds at extremely low concentrations in drinking water, which could lead to increased cleanup costs at many of our environmental remediation sites.\n\nAs disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter,  such  uncertainties  may  be  resolved,  allowing  us  to  estimate  and  recognize  the  initial  liability  to  remediate  a  particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.\n\nIf we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of  environmental  remediation  will  be  shared  with  other  liable  PRPs.  Generally,  PRPs  that  are  ultimately  determined  to  be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.",

      "question": "How does Boeing's use of program accounting for the 787 Program reflect both the operational challenges in revenue forecasting and the broader accounting policy framework for long-term contracts, especially in light of the $880 million net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2021?",
      "answer": "Boeing applies program accounting to the 787 Program, which requires forecasting revenue based on expected delivery timelines, FAA approval dates, and customer compensation for delays, all of which are highly uncertain and subject to management judgment (page_136). This uncertainty has led to potential reach-forward losses and complex audit procedures. In the broader context, Boeing's BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting, which calculates cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for each program (page_34). However, for long-term contracts\u2014like those in BDS and BGS\u2014Boeing uses a different model where cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is recognized based on estimated profit (page_56). The $880 million net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2021 highlight the volatility and risk inherent in these estimates, particularly for fixed-price development programs like the KC-46A Tanker and VC-25B, which share similar estimation challenges as the 787 Program. This shows how program accounting, while structured, is highly sensitive to external delays and internal performance risks, especially when forecasting spans multiple years and regulatory approvals.",

The  Company  uses program  accounting  in  order  to  compute  cost  of  sales  and  margin  for  each  commercial  airplane  sold.  The  use  of program accounting requires estimating the revenue expected to be earned upon delivery of the aircraft included in the program's  accounting  quantity.  The  timing  of  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration's  ('FAA')  approval  to  resume deliveries, the impact to the delivery schedule from delayed deliveries, and the value of the consideration expected to be  provided  to  customers  for  delivery  delays  are  key  factors  that  affect  estimated  revenue.  There  is  increased estimation  uncertainty  related  to  the  revenue  forecasts  of  aircraft  which  have  reached  or  are  expected  to  reach  a delivery delay period that provides the customer with a contractual termination right. Due to continued uncertainty in the expected FAA approval date to resume 787 aircraft deliveries, there is significant judgment in determining which aircraft will  reach  these  contractual  termination  rights.  Changes  to  the  expected  delivery  resumption  date  could  have  a flowthrough impact and result in additional consideration to customers. This could result in lower margins or further material reach-forward losses. Auditing the estimated revenues for the 787 program involved extensive audit effort and required professionals with specialized industry experience given the high degree of complexity and subjectivity related to management's estimates.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures over the estimated revenues for the 787 program included the following, among others:\n\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for engineering and production operations, to assess  whether the estimated FAA  approval and  delivery resumption date represent management's best estimates based on the status of the rework activity.\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including the individuals communicating with the FAA, to assess if there is contradictory information to that assumed by management related to the estimated timeline for rework completion or getting FAA approval to resume deliveries.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  method  for  developing  the  deliveries schedule assumptions.\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current contracts with customers and expected consideration to be provided to customers.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  and  significant  assumptions used in developing its estimates related to forecasted revenue for aircraft which have or are expected to have delivery delays.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical  extrapolation  of  such  data,  and  management's  judgment  regarding  the  range  of  reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.",

Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales.

For  long-term  contracts,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.

Our  long-term  contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\n\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these  estimates  include  inflationary trends,  technical  and  schedule  risk,  internal  and  subcontractor performance  trends,  business  volume  assumptions,  COVID-19  disruptions,  asset  utilization  and  anticipated  labor agreements.\n\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly.  Changes  in  these  estimates  could  result  in  recognition  of  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  to  the performance obligation's inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reachforward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments across all long-term contracts increased loss from operations by  $880  million,  $942  million  and  $111  million,  respectively.  The  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  in  2021  were primarily  due  to  losses  recognized  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker,  VC-25B  and  Commercial  Crew  programs.  These  are  all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\n\nDue  to  the  significance  of  judgment  in  the  estimation  process  described  above,  it  is  likely  that  materially  different earnings  could  be  recorded  if  we  used  different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change. Changes  in  underlying  assumptions/estimates,  supplier  performance,  or  circumstances  may  adversely  or  positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2021, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.\n\n## Program Accounting\n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-term  production  effort  for  delivery  under  existing  and  anticipated contracts.  The  determination  of  the  accounting  quantity  is  limited  by  the  ability  to  make  reasonably  dependable estimates.",

Our  commercial  aircraft  production  system  is  extremely  complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays  or  failures  to  achieve  required  regulatory  approval,  could  result  in  significant  out-of-sequence  work  and increased  production  costs,  as  well  as  delayed  deliveries  to  customers,  impacts  to  aircraft  performance  and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. For example, in 2021, we performed additional inspections and associated rework  on  787  aircraft  in  inventory  and  continued  discussions  with  the  FAA  regarding  required  actions  to  resume deliveries, resulting in additional costs and further delays in aircraft deliveries to customers.\n\nIf  our  commercial  airplanes  fail  to  satisfy  performance  and  reliability  requirements,  we  could  face  additional  costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability  standards,  as  well  as  those  of  customers  and  regulatory  agencies,  can  be  costly  and  technologically challenging.  These  challenges  are  particularly  significant  with  newer  aircraft  programs.  Any  failure  of  any  Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.\n\n## Changes  in  levels  of  U.S.  government  defense  spending  or  overall  acquisition  priorities  could  negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD. Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political environment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills.\n\nThe timeliness of FY22 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations for government departments or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which  could  impact  the  Company's  operations.  Alternatively,  Congress  may  fund  government  departments  and agencies  with  one  or  more  Continuing  Resolutions;  however,  this  would  restrict  the  execution  of  certain  program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending in FY22 and beyond, and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, will continue to be subject to pressure.\n\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S.  DoD  and  other  government  agencies  (including  NASA),  including  changes  to  national  security  and  defense priorities,  and  tension  between  modernization  investments,  sustainment  investments,  and  investments  in  new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or budget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company's financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nIn  addition,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  and  the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innovation, cybersecurity and delivery of technical data and",

At December 31, 2021, $1,906 of 737 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other nonrecurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders,  and  $7  is  expected  to  be  recovered  from  units  included  in  the  program  accounting  quantity  that  represent expected future orders.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 777X program: $3,363 and $1,727 of work in process and $3,521 and $3,295 of unamortized tooling and other nonrecurring costs.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X program plus costs already included in 777X inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $6,493 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs. As a result, 777X deferred production costs were immaterial at December 31, 2020 and remain immaterial at December 31, 2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, any contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 787 program plus costs already included in 787 inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $3,460 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs. At",

The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASC 606.\n\nBCA total backlog of $296,882 million at December 31, 2021 increased from $281,588 million at December 31, 2020, reflecting new orders in excess of deliveries, increases in projected price escalation and decreases in the number of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially  offset  by  aircraft  order  cancellations. Aircraft  order  cancellations  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2021 totaled $27,542 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX and 787 aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in an increase to backlog of $3,810 million primarily due to 777X aircraft, partially offset by 787 aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer controlled  contingency  may  exist,  as  well  as  an  assessment  of  whether  the  customer  is  committed  to  perform  or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we are unable to ramp up deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft, and/or if entry into service of the 777X, 737  MAX  7  and/or  737  MAX  10  is  further  delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  to  backlog  and/or significant  order  cancellations.

The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make  reasonably  dependable  estimates  of  the  revenue  and  cost  of  existing  and  anticipated  contracts.  It  is  a  key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program's life. Estimation of  each  program's  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.\n\nThe accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.",

Deliveries have remained paused since May 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. The estimate of customer considerations is based on a number of factors, including our current assumptions regarding timing of FAA approval enabling resumption of deliveries, estimated timing of completion of inspections and rework to enable deliveries in future periods, estimated timing of production rate increases as well as customer and market assessments. We continue to conduct inspections and rework and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery of the 787. Our program revenue and cost estimates reflect the assumption that production rates will remain very low until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 per month over time. We have also assumed lower forecasted revenues due to delayed deliveries. Our program assumptions reflect our current best estimate. However, if the program experiences further delivery delays or other factors such as additional inspections or rework that result in lower revenue or higher cost estimates, we could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.\n\n## Goodwill Impairments\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the reporting unit, then a quantitative test is performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For reporting units where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.\n\nWe generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flows and marketbased valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates and delivery profiles, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.\n\nWe completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2021, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, discount rates or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\n\n## Pension Plans\n\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement  savings  plan  in  2016.  Additional  union  employees  transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.

The  Company  uses program  accounting  in  order  to  compute  cost  of  sales  and  margin  for  each  commercial  airplane  sold.  The  use  of program accounting requires estimating the revenue expected to be earned upon delivery of the aircraft included in the program's  accounting  quantity.  The  timing  of  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration's  ('FAA')  approval  to  resume deliveries, the impact to the delivery schedule from delayed deliveries, and the value of the consideration expected to be  provided  to  customers  for  delivery  delays  are  key  factors  that  affect  estimated  revenue.  There  is  increased estimation  uncertainty  related  to  the  revenue  forecasts  of  aircraft  which  have  reached  or  are  expected  to  reach  a delivery delay period that provides the customer with a contractual termination right. Due to continued uncertainty in the expected FAA approval date to resume 787 aircraft deliveries, there is significant judgment in determining which aircraft will  reach  these  contractual  termination  rights.  Changes  to  the  expected  delivery  resumption  date  could  have  a flowthrough impact and result in additional consideration to customers. This could result in lower margins or further material reach-forward losses. Auditing the estimated revenues for the 787 program involved extensive audit effort and required professionals with specialized industry experience given the high degree of complexity and subjectivity related to management's estimates.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures over the estimated revenues for the 787 program included the following, among others:\n\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for engineering and production operations, to assess  whether the estimated FAA  approval and  delivery resumption date represent management's best estimates based on the status of the rework activity.\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including the individuals communicating with the FAA, to assess if there is contradictory information to that assumed by management related to the estimated timeline for rework completion or getting FAA approval to resume deliveries.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  method  for  developing  the  deliveries schedule assumptions.\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current contracts with customers and expected consideration to be provided to customers.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  and  significant  assumptions used in developing its estimates related to forecasted revenue for aircraft which have or are expected to have delivery delays.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical  extrapolation  of  such  data,  and  management's  judgment  regarding  the  range  of  reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.",

During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. At December 31, 2021, cash and short-term investments totaled $16.2 billion. Our debt balance totaled $58.1 billion at December 31, 2021, down from $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020. We expect negative operating cash flows in future quarters until deliveries begin to return to historical levels, and if the pace and scope of the recovery are worse than we currently contemplate, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations and obligations. If we were to need to obtain additional financing, uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on us and the aerospace industry, as well as continued uncertainty with respect to our credit rating could limit our access to credit markets and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, certain of our customers may also be unable  to  make  timely  payments  to  us.  Factors  that  could  limit  our  access  to  additional  liquidity  include  further disruptions  in  the  global  capital  markets  and/or  additional  declines  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and/or meet outstanding debt obligations and contractual commitments. In addition, further downgrades in our credit ratings could  adversely  affect  our  cost  of  funds  and  related  margins,  liquidity,  competitive  position  and  access  to  capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse impact on our businesses.\n\nCustomer-related risks: Commercial air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend has impacted  passenger  traffic  most  severely.  Most  airlines  have  significantly  reduced  their  capacity,  and  many  could implement  further  reductions.  Many  airlines  are  also  implementing  significant  reductions  in  staffing.  These  capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to our customers' revenue, earnings, and  cash  flow,  and  in  some  cases  may  threaten  the  future  viability  of  some  of  our  customers,  potentially  causing defaults within our customer financing portfolio, which was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and/or requiring us to remarket aircraft  that  have  already  been  produced  and/or  are  currently  in  backlog.  If  we  are  unable  to  successfully remarket these aircraft and/or the narrow-body and wide-body markets do not recover as soon as we are currently assuming, or if we are required to further reduce production rates and/or contract the accounting quantity on any of our commercial programs, we could experience material reductions in earnings and/or be required to recognize a reachforward  loss  on  one  or  more  of  our  programs.  For  example,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  we  recognized  a  reachforward  loss  on  the  777X  program  in  part  due  to  impacts  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic. Additionally,  we  may experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  associated  impacts  on  demand.  Our  customers  may  also  lack  sufficient  liquidity  to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the near-term impact, there is risk that the industry implements longer-term strategies involving reduced capacity, shifting route patterns and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel as a result of travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements.\n\nAs a result, there is significant uncertainty with respect to whether and at what point commercial air traffic capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. This uncertainty may have a significant impact on the demand for both single-aisle  and  wide-body  commercial  aircraft,  as  well  as  for  the  services  we  provide  to  commercial  airlines.  In addition, a lengthy period of reduced industry-wide demand for commercial aircraft would put additional pressure on our suppliers,  resulting  in  increased  procurement  costs  and/or  additional  supply  chain  disruption.

For  example,  liabilities  arising  from  the  use  of  certain  of  our  products,  such  as  aircraft technologies, space systems, spacecraft, satellites, missile systems, weapons, cybersecurity, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002  Homeland  Security  Act,  no  such  protection  is  available  outside  the  U.S.,  potentially  resulting  in  significant liabilities.  The  amount  of  insurance  coverage  we  maintain  may  be  inadequate  to  cover  these  or  other  claims  or liabilities.\n\n## A  significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio  is  concentrated  among  certain  customers  and  in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio  is  concentrated  among  certain  customers  and  in  distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit.

We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft  and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 12 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions' requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.\n\n## Item 1B.

      "answer": "The distribution and sale of GE HealthCare shares had a multi-faceted financial impact on GE. First, the pro-rata distribution of approximately 80.1% of GE HealthCare shares in January 2023 resulted in a $5,300 million decrease in retained earnings (page_41). Then, in 2024, the complete sale of the remaining 19.9% stake generated $5.2 billion in proceeds (page_14), which contributed to GE's cash flow. From a tax perspective, the disposition of these shares had an insignificant tax impact due to the tax-free nature of the transaction and available capital losses (page_12). Together, these facts suggest a deliberate financial strategy to monetize the HealthCare business while managing tax exposure and strengthening liquidity.",

Additionally, GE facilitates supplier-side programs where participating suppliers can voluntarily sell their GE Aerospace receivables to third parties, with $3,798 million in supplier invoices paid through these programs in 2024 (page 55).

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks. Insurance revenue is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenue but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenue for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, administration and surrender. Interest credited to policyholder accounts is charged to expense.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions. A s a run-off insurance operation consisting substantially all of reinsurance, contracts are grouped into cohorts by legal entity and product type, based on the date the reinsurance contract was consummated. Future policy benefit reserves are adjusted each period as a result of updating lifetime net premium ratios for differences between actual and expected experience with the retroactive effect of those variances recognized in current period earnings. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings.\n\nAs our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves recognized in earnings. However, cash flows used to estimate future policy benefit reserves are also discounted using an upper-medium grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixedincome instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liabilities and is updated each reporting period with changes recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). As a result, changes in the current discount rate at each reporting period are recognized as an adjustment to A OCI and not earnings each period, whereas, changes relating to cash flow assumptions are recognized in the Statement of Earnings (Loss).\n\nLiabilities for inv estment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. On our Statement of Financial Position, we measure our plan assets at fair value and the obligations at the present value of the estimated payments to plan participants. Participants earn benefits based on their service and pay. Those estimated future payment amounts are determined based on assumptions. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in a separate component of equity each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable, who participate in the plan. See Note 13 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability  in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROG RAMS. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables, their inv olv ement does not change the nature, existence, amount or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any  characteristics of the trade pay ables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables as borrowings.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\n\n46 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "answer": "GE applies the percentage-of-completion method to recognize revenue for long-term service agreements based on incurred costs relative to total estimated costs, a process that involves significant estimation of future customer asset utilization and maintenance costs over contract terms that can span up to 25 years. This method results in a net liability balance of $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2024, which represents approximately 4.1% of total estimated life-of-contract billings. The auditor identified this revenue recognition approach as a critical audit matter due to the complexity and subjectivity involved in estimating future costs and customer utilization patterns, requiring extensive auditor judgment and specialized skills. Furthermore, contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively, while changes in estimates are applied on a cumulative catch-up basis, which can materially affect earnings in the current period. This highlights the dual challenge of managing both estimation risk and contract evolution in long-term service agreements.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of A merica.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company A ccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCA OB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 3, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCA OB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCA OB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Sales of services - Revenue recognition on certain Aerospace long-term service agreements - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit M atter Description\n\nThe Company enters into long-term service agreements with certain customers. These agreements require the Company to provide maintenance services for customer assets over the contract term, which generally range from 10 to 25 years. Revenue for these agreements is recognized using the percentage of completion method, based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs over the contract term. A s part of the revenue recognition process, the Company estimates both customer payments that are expected to be received and costs to perform maintenance services over the contract term. Key assumptions within those estimates that require significant judgment from management include: (a) how the customer will utilize the assets covered over the contract term; (b) the expected timing and extent of future overhaul services; (c) the future cost of materials, labor, and other resources; and (d) forward looking information concerning market conditions.\n\nGiven the complexity involved with evaluating the key estimates, which includes significant judgment necessary to estimate future costs, auditing these assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive audit effort, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skills and industry knowledge.\n\n## How the Critical Audit M atter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur auditing procedures over the key estimates described above related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition of the long-term service agreements included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over the revenue recognition process for the long-term service agreements, including controls over management's key estimates.\n- We evaluated management's risk assessment process through observation of key meetings and processes, including inspection of documentation, addressing contract status and current market conditions including the timely incorporation of changes that affect total estimated costs to complete the contract.\n- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and key assumptions applied in recognizing revenue and developing cost estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG -TERM SERVICES AG REEMENTS. We enter into long-term services agreements with our customers, predominantly within the CES segment, that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. Contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the current contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.\n\nOur rights to consideration for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) and contractual payment terms are based on either periodic billing schedules or upon the occurrence of a maintenance event, such as an overhaul. A s a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenue of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.\n\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the frequency of maintenance events and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the maintenance. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\n\nWe routinely review estimates and revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. Changes in estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis with an adjustment to revenue in the current period. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.\n\nWe regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, our long-term service agreements net liability balance of $6.6 billion represents approximately 4.1% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $162 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.4% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING ENGINEERING  COSTS. We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. Contract fulfillment costs are capitalized to the extent recoverable from the customer contract, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized contract fulfillment costs, which requires significant judgement. Specifically, we estimate program volumes, contract revenue based on negotiated prices, and product costs based on input costs, inflation and productivity. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF G OODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANG IBLE ASSETS . Goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary, impairment testing. In the impairment test, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions, or a market approach, when available and appropriate, utilizing market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, or both. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. In the fourth quarter of each y ear, we perform our annual impairment test. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nWe review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 17",

          "chunk_text": "Long-term Services Agreements. We enter into long-term services agreements with our customers primarily within our Commercial Engines and Services segment. These agreements require us to provide maintenance, overhauls and standby \"warranty-type\" services, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision.\n\nWe recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Throughout the life of a contract, this measure of progress captures the nature, timing and extent of our underlying performance activities as our stand-ready services often fluctuate between routine inspections and maintenance, unscheduled service events and major overhauls at predetermined usage intervals. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\n\nOur rights to consideration for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) and contractual payment terms are based on either periodic billing schedules or upon the occurrence of a maintenance event, such as an overhaul. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. Contract assets and contract liabilities for long-term serv ice agreements are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and include amounts that may be billed and collected beyond one year due to the long-cycle nature of our contracts. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. Contract modifications in our long-term service agreements are predominantly accounted for on a prospective basis. Changes in estimates for existing contracts are accounted for on a cumulative catchup basis. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nOther Services Revenue Contracts. We enter into contracts to perform other services, including time and material service contracts and component repairs, where we enhance the value of a customer asset and the customer pays us on a per event basis. For time and material overhauls, the contract duration and transaction price are limited to the individual maintenance event and we recognize revenue on an over time basis as the services are rendered, in proportion to cost incurred. Labor costs are recognized as incurred and costs of replacement parts are recognized when we can reliably determine that the parts are nonfungible. For component repairs, we recognize revenue when the services are completed.\n\nDevelopment Agreements. We enter into long-term development agreements primarily within our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. The majority of these agreements are with the U.S. Government for the research and design of defense products. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal A cquisition Regulation (FA R) and are either fixed-priced or based on estimated or actual costs of providing services. Certain contracts include incentive and award fees, based on achievement of specified targets, which we consider as variable consideration. The amount included in the transaction price represents our estimate of the most likely amount we expect to collect to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Revenue is recognized on an over time basis because of continuous transfer of control to the customer using percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs. Changes in estimates for existing contracts are accounted for on a cumulative catchup basis.\n\nNONRECURRING ENGINEERING  COSTS . We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. If we determine the costs are for development of products for a specific customer and there is a high probability of recovery from future sales to that customer, we capitalize the costs we incur, excluding early-stage costs which are expensed as research and development. Capitalized nonrecurring engineering costs are included in Contract and other deferred assets in our accompanying Statement of Financial Position and are amortized to Cost of equipment sold ratably over each unit sold. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized nonrecurring engineering costs and if we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the asset is impaired. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, development and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. We enter certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by third parties are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as revenue.\n\nCOLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. We enter into collaborative arrangements with manufacturers and suppliers of components used to build and maintain certain engines. Under these arrangements, we and our collaborative partners share in the risks and rewards of these programs through various revenue, cost and profit-sharing payment structures. We recognize revenue and costs for these arrangements based on the scope of work we are responsible for transferring to our customers. Our net payments to participants are primarily recorded as either cost of services sold ($4,144 million, $3,781 million and $2,890 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively) or as cost of equipment sold ($784 million, $663 million and $658 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively).",

      "question": "How does GE's sensitivity analysis of cash flow assumptions for future policy benefit reserves align with the immaterial charges observed in their 2024 annual review and the accounting treatment for assumption changes in run-off insurance operations?",
      "answer": "GE's sensitivity analysis on page 20 shows that small changes in cash flow assumptions can lead to materially different outcomes in future policy benefit reserves, yet the 2024 annual review on page 56 reported immaterial charges to net earnings, indicating that actual experience remained largely consistent with modeled expectations. This aligns with the accounting policy on page 46, which explains that assumption updates are applied retroactively using actual historical experience and the locked-in discount rate, with the impact recognized in current period earnings. The combination of these perspectives suggests that while the models are sensitive to input changes, actual experience in 2024 did not deviate significantly enough to trigger material reserve adjustments, consistent with the run-off nature of the insurance operations.",

          "chunk_text": "The primary cash flow assumptions used in the annual review include:\n\nMorbidity . M orbidity  assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care insurance exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utiliz ation (amount of av ailable benefits ex pected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last, including claim terminations due to death or recovery).\n\nRate of Change in M orbidity . Our review incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim incidence rates. These estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. This exercise of actuarial judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual review, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base assumptions, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and healthcare technology development.\n\nTerminations . Terminations include active life mortality and lapse. M ortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. Lapse refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to non-payment of premiums by a policyholder. Lapse rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment.\n\nFuture long-term care premium rate increases . Substantially all long-term care insurance policies that are currently premium paying allow the issuing insurance entity  to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. A s a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. While we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. The amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. We consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations.\n\nIncluded in Insurance losses and annuity benefits in our Statement of Earnings (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, are favorable and unfavorable pre-tax adjustments of $196 million and $(155) million, respectively, from updating the net premium ratio (i.e., the percentage of projected gross premiums required to cover expected policy benefits and related expenses) after updating for actual historical experience each quarter and updating of future cash flow assumptions in the third quarter of each year.\n\nSensitivities. The following table provides sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves using the locked-in discount rate assumption and have been estimated across the entire product line rather than at an individual cohort level. A s our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves. M any of our assumptions, which are based on our credible experience, are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below. In addition, the effects of changes to cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves may be partially or wholly reflected in the period in which the assumptions are changed and/or over future periods and may vary across cohorts.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks. Insurance revenue is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenue but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenue for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, administration and surrender. Interest credited to policyholder accounts is charged to expense.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions. A s a run-off insurance operation consisting substantially all of reinsurance, contracts are grouped into cohorts by legal entity and product type, based on the date the reinsurance contract was consummated. Future policy benefit reserves are adjusted each period as a result of updating lifetime net premium ratios for differences between actual and expected experience with the retroactive effect of those variances recognized in current period earnings. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings.\n\nAs our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves recognized in earnings. However, cash flows used to estimate future policy benefit reserves are also discounted using an upper-medium grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixedincome instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liabilities and is updated each reporting period with changes recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). As a result, changes in the current discount rate at each reporting period are recognized as an adjustment to A OCI and not earnings each period, whereas, changes relating to cash flow assumptions are recognized in the Statement of Earnings (Loss).\n\nLiabilities for inv estment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. On our Statement of Financial Position, we measure our plan assets at fair value and the obligations at the present value of the estimated payments to plan participants. Participants earn benefits based on their service and pay. Those estimated future payment amounts are determined based on assumptions. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in a separate component of equity each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable, who participate in the plan. See Note 13 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability  in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROG RAMS. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables, their inv olv ement does not change the nature, existence, amount or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any  characteristics of the trade pay ables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables as borrowings.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\n\n46 2024 FORM  10-K",

Fair Value Measurements\n\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis: For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities, Solventum common stock and derivative instruments. The information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company's financial statements on a recurring basis for 2024 and 2023.\n\n3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\n- Available-for-sale marketable securities - except certain U.S. municipal securities: Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (ex cluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 13.\n- Available-for-sale marketable securities -certain U.S. municipal securities only : 3M holds municipal securities with several cities in the United States as of December 31, 2024. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method references the carrying value of the corresponding finance lease obligation, and as such, will be classified as level 3 securities separately.\n- Solventum common stock: Solventum Corporation common stock is carried at stock prices that are readily available from active markets and are representative of fair value. 3M classifies this investment as Level 1. It is included within other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n- Derivative instruments : The Company's derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , are required to be recorded at fair value. The Company's derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M's net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n\n3M has determined that foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M's primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through thirdparty or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.",

      "question": "How does 3M's classification and valuation methodology for U.S. municipal securities in their fair value disclosures reconcile with the fluctuation in fair value observed in their financial tables and the breakdown of marketable securities between current and non-current assets?",
      "answer": "3M classifies certain U.S. municipal securities as Level 3 fair value measurements due to their unique valuation methodology, which references the carrying value of corresponding finance lease obligations (page_81). This classification aligns with the $20 million fair value of U.S. municipal securities reported under Level 3 for 2024 in the detailed fair value hierarchy table (page_82). Additionally, the breakdown in the balance sheet shows $4 million of U.S. municipal securities classified as current marketable securities and $16 million as non-current, totaling $20 million, which matches the Level 3 amount and reflects the long-term nature of a portion of these holdings (page_67).",

        "Hop 1: MMM(page_82) \u2192 U.S. Municipal Securities: Discloses $20 million fair value under Level 3 for 2024, indicating complex valuation methodology.",
        "Hop 2: MMM(page_67) \u2192 U.S. Municipal Securities: Shows $4 million in current and $16 million in non-current marketable securities, totaling $20 million, reflecting holding period segmentation.",
        "Hop 3: MMM(page_81) \u2192 U.S. Municipal Securities: Explains that certain municipal securities are classified as Level 3 due to valuation based on finance lease obligations rather than market pricing."

Fair Value Measurements\n\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis: For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities, Solventum common stock and derivative instruments. The information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company's financial statements on a recurring basis for 2024 and 2023.\n\n3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\n- Available-for-sale marketable securities - except certain U.S. municipal securities: Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (ex cluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 13.\n- Available-for-sale marketable securities -certain U.S. municipal securities only : 3M holds municipal securities with several cities in the United States as of December 31, 2024. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method references the carrying value of the corresponding finance lease obligation, and as such, will be classified as level 3 securities separately.\n- Solventum common stock: Solventum Corporation common stock is carried at stock prices that are readily available from active markets and are representative of fair value. 3M classifies this investment as Level 1. It is included within other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n- Derivative instruments : The Company's derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , are required to be recorded at fair value. The Company's derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M's net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n\n3M has determined that foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M's primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through thirdparty or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.",

      "question": "What are the full financial and strategic implications of the Solventum spin-off for MMM, considering the retained equity interest, pension obligation transfers, and indemnification of legal liabilities?",
      "answer": "The Solventum spin-off has significant financial and strategic implications for MMM. First, MMM retains an equity interest in Solventum, though the market value of these shares is subject to volatility, and there is no assurance regarding the timing or proceeds of MMM\u2019s eventual divestiture. Second, MMM transferred substantial pension obligations to Solventum, including $1,850 million in U.S. qualified and non-pension benefit obligations and $615 million internationally, reducing MMM\u2019s ongoing liabilities. Third, Solventum has assumed legal liabilities previously held by MMM, including those related to the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act/Qui Tam Litigation, which could materially affect MMM if indemnification terms are challenged or if Solventum fails to meet its obligations. Together, these elements reflect a strategic restructuring to reduce complexity and liability exposure, while retaining potential upside through equity ownership, albeit with execution and market risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MMM (page_17) \u2192 Solventum: MMM retained an equity interest in Solventum post-spin-off and is exposed to market volatility, with no assurance on the timing or proceeds of divestiture.",
        "Hop 2: MMM (page_71) \u2192 Solventum: MMM transferred $1,850 million in U.S. and $615 million in international pension obligations to Solventum, significantly reducing its benefit liabilities.",
        "Hop 3: MMM (page_84) \u2192 Solventum: Solventum assumed legal liabilities related to key litigation matters, including indemnification obligations that protect MMM but remain contingent on Solventum\u2019s ability to fulfill them."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFollowing the separation, the Company is a smaller, less diversified company than it was prior to the separation, which could make the Company more vulnerable to factors impacting its performance, such as changing market conditions and market volatility. In addition, the Company may be unable to find suitable alternatives for goods and services that Solventum temporarily provides to the Company pursuant to the agreements noted above, or such alternative goods and services may be more expensive than provided by Solventum to the Company.\n\nThe Company retained an equity interest in Solventum in connection with the spin-off. The Company cannot predict the trading price of shares of Solventum's common stock and the market value of the Solventum shares is subject to market volatility and other factors outside of the Company's control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Solventum within five years from the spin-off, but there can be no assurance regarding the timing of, or timeframe over which, such divestiture or divestitures may occur, or the amount of proceeds received by the Company in connection with any such divestitures.\n\nIn addition, while it is intended that the transaction be tax -free to the Company's stockholders for U.S. federal income tax  purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off is ultimately determined to be tax able, the Company, Solventum, or the Company's stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nThe Company has processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. These processes are integrated into the Company's overall risk management systems, as overseen by the Company's board of directors, primarily through its audit committee. These processes also include overseeing and identifying risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers. The Company conducts security assessments of certain third-party providers before engagement and has established monitoring procedures in its effort to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third parties. The Company from time to time engages third-party consultants, legal advisors, and audit firms in evaluating and testing the Company's risk management systems and assessing and remediating certain cybersecurity incidents. The Company also continues to provide its employees with cybersecurity and data protection training to support its risk mitigation efforts.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe audit committee of the Company's board of directors oversees, among other things, the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal controls, including internal controls designed to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The audit committee is informed of material risks from cybersecurity threats pursuant to the escalation criteria as set forth in the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Further, at least once per quarter, the Company's Chief Information and Digital Officer ('CIDO'), and/or the Company's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), reports on cybersecurity matters, including material risks and threats, to the Company's audit committee, and the audit committee provides updates to the Company's board of directors at regular board meetings. The CIDO also provides updates annually or more frequently as appropriate to the Company's board of directors.\n\n## Management\n\nUnder the oversight of the audit committee of the Company's board of directors, and as directed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the CIDO and CISO are primarily responsible for the assessment and management of material cybersecurity risks. The CIDO has more than two decades of experience with global technology organizations across multiple industries. The CISO has over 25 years of experience in information security, risk management, and compliance, has served as the chief information security officer at other organizations and, among other things, is a certified information systems security professional. The CIDO and CISO are also supported by a Cybersecurity &amp; Privacy Executive Oversight Committee, which is comprised of certain members of senior management and is provides crossfunctional support for cybersecurity risk management and facilitates the response to any cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe Company's CISO oversees the Company's cybersecurity incident response plan and related processes that are designed to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO also coordinates with the Company's legal counsel and third parties, such as consultants and legal advisors, to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents pursuant to criteria set forth in the Company's incident response plan and related processes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on ex perience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably estimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings, and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\n\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in ex cess of presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters for which no accruals are currently recorded, because losses are not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages, or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions, that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages, but with which the Company may not agree. Such information may or may not lead the Company to determine that it is able to make a reasonable estimate as to a probable loss or range of loss in connection with a matter. However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, future adverse rulings or developments, or settlements in, one or more matters could result in future changes to determinations of probable and reasonably estimable losses in other matters.\n\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings: The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their ex clusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its ex perience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company's insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an ex pense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\n\nImpact of Solventum Spin-Off : On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its Health Care business as an independent company known as Solventum. Concurrent with the spin-off, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements, including transition agreements and a separation and distribution agreement that, among other things, identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, indemnification and defense obligations, and the contracts to be transferred to Solventum and 3M as part of the spin-off. In general, and except as noted below and as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, certain liabilities related to Solventum or the assets that are transferred to Solventum in connection with the spin-off will be retained by or transferred to Solventum. For example, potential liabilities associated with the matters previously described in prior filings under the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation sections of this Note 19 have been assumed by Solventum pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, and Solventum will indemnify and defend the Company in these actions.",

      "question": "How does 3M's reconsolidation of the Aearo Entities in Q2 2023 impact the Transportation and Electronics segment's sales performance and financial presentation across both GAAP and non-GAAP measures, especially in light of the prior deconsolidation in Q3 2022?",
      "answer": "3M's reconsolidation of the Aearo Entities in Q2 2023 directly affected the Transportation and Electronics segment's sales figures, as the acquisition impact from reconsolidation was separately reflected in year-on-year comparisons. In 2024, Transportation and Electronics sales were reported as down 1.4% in U.S. dollars, but adjusted for special items\u2014including the impact of PFAS manufactured products\u2014sales were up 3.1%. This suggests that the reconsolidation contributed positively to sales performance. Conversely, in 2023, the segment reported a 4.5% decline in sales, which remained unchanged even after adjusting for PFAS products, indicating that the reconsolidation did not offset broader market headwinds. From a financial reporting perspective, the Aearo Entities were reconsolidated following the dismissal of their bankruptcy proceedings, as noted in the accounting policies section, which clarified that the entities were previously deconsolidated in Q3 2022. This reconsolidation altered the composition of the segment's financials and required retrospective adjustments to conform prior period presentations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 3M Company and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. As used herein, the term '3M' or 'Company' refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\n\nThe financial statements consolidate all applicable subsidiaries; intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. In the second quarter of 2023, 3M reconsolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of their voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nLocal currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States, with the exception of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, which are not material to 3M. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\n- As discussed in Note 2, on April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business (the Separation) through a pro rata distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Solventum Corporation (Solventum) to 3M stockholders. As a result of the Separation, Solventum became an independent public company and 3M no longer consolidates Solventum into 3M's financial results. In connection with the Separation, the historical net income of Solventum and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation are reported in 3M's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\n- 3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024 as further described in Note 22. To the extent these changes impacted 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue information, data in Note 3 has also been updated.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\n\nInvestments: 3M invests in marketable and equity securities. Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M accounts for its ownership interest in Solventum as an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value. All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balances associated with equity securities are disclosed in Note 8.\n\n3M regularly reviews investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, an impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.\n\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.",

      "question": "How does 3M's financial treatment of its retained ownership in Solventum Corporation reflect both the strategic impact of the Health Care business separation and the accounting policy framework for equity investments with readily determinable fair values?",
      "answer": "3M completed the separation of its Health Care business on April 1, 2024, distributing 80.1% of Solventum\u2019s shares to shareholders, while retaining a minority ownership stake. As a result, Solventum is no longer consolidated into 3M\u2019s financial results and is instead accounted for as an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value. Under 3M\u2019s accounting policies, such equity investments are measured at fair value with changes in value reflected in net income. This treatment is evidenced by the $1.6 billion net unrealized gain on the investment in Solventum reported at December 31, 2024. The separation also prompted changes in 3M\u2019s segment reporting structure, as described in the notes, to reflect the post-divestiture operational realignment. Together, these elements show how the strategic separation decision directly influenced both the financial presentation and accounting classification of Solventum within 3M\u2019s consolidated financial statements.",

Divestitures\n\n2024 Divestitures: On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the separation of its Health Care business (the Separation) through a pro rata distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Solventum Corporation (Solventum) to 3M stockholders. See Note 2 for additional detail, including information regarding reporting the historical net income of Solventum and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation in 3M's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\n\n2023 Divestitures: In August 2023, 3M completed the sale of assets associated with its dental local anesthetic business (formerly part of the \"Other\" category of Corporate and Unallocated and Other) to Pierrel S.p.A. for approximately $60 million in cash. The dental local anesthetic business had annual sales of approximately $30 million. The gain on this transaction, net of a loss associated with a previous contingent indemnification obligation from a 2020 divestiture, resulted in a 2023 net pre-tax gain of $36 million.\n\nThe dental local anesthetic business was part of the former Health Care business segment. Because this anesthetic business was divested prior to the separation of Solventum, its operations are not reflected as discontinued operations and instead are reflected herein as part of \"Other\" for all applicable periods presented as discussed in Note 22.",

Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. As used herein, the term '3M' or 'Company' refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\n\nThe financial statements consolidate all applicable subsidiaries; intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. In the second quarter of 2023, 3M reconsolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of their voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nLocal currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States, with the exception of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, which are not material to 3M. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\n- As discussed in Note 2, on April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business (the Separation) through a pro rata distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Solventum Corporation (Solventum) to 3M stockholders. As a result of the Separation, Solventum became an independent public company and 3M no longer consolidates Solventum into 3M's financial results. In connection with the Separation, the historical net income of Solventum and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation are reported in 3M's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\n- 3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024 as further described in Note 22. To the extent these changes impacted 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue information, data in Note 3 has also been updated.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\n\nInvestments: 3M invests in marketable and equity securities. Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M accounts for its ownership interest in Solventum as an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value. All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balances associated with equity securities are disclosed in Note 8.\n\n3M regularly reviews investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, an impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.\n\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.",

      "question": "How does Boeing's use of program accounting for commercial aircraft contracts reconcile with the financial impact of changing cost estimates on the 777X program and the treatment of cost of sales in the BCA segment?",
      "answer": "Boeing uses program accounting in its BCA segment to determine cost of sales by applying the product of revenue recognized and the estimated total cost-to-revenue ratio for each commercial aircraft program. This method was especially critical for the 777X program, where changes in cost estimates due to regulatory certification delays significantly impacted margins and required extensive audit scrutiny. In 2023, higher interest costs and lower expected returns on pension assets, partially offset by lower amortization of actuarial losses, contributed to a decrease in non-operating pension income, which affects overall financial performance and indirectly influences the funding and cost assumptions used in program accounting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [BA](page_28) \u2192 [Program Accounting]: The BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales, where cost of sales equals the product of revenue recognized and the estimated total cost-to-revenue ratio for each aircraft program.",
        "Hop 2: [BA](page_115) \u2192 [Program Accounting]: The 777X program's cost estimates were subject to change due to regulatory certification delays, increasing the risk of lower margins or material reach-forward losses, which required extensive audit procedures.",
        "Hop 3: [BA](page_59) \u2192 [Program Accounting]: Program accounting is used to determine the amount reported as cost of sales for commercial aircraft contracts, based on the transaction price allocated to each performance obligation and the point-in-time revenue recognition upon aircraft delivery."

      "question": "How does Boeing's 2023 Incentive Stock Plan align with its broader compensation strategy and financial commitments, considering the plan's structure, its relationship to the predecessor 2003 plan, and the potential equity dilution impact of performance-based awards?",
      "answer": "Boeing's 2023 Incentive Stock Plan, which replaced the 2003 Incentive Stock Plan (no further awards may be granted under the 2003 plan), authorizes 12,900,000 shares plus undelivered or retained shares from the predecessor plan, reflecting continuity in equity-based compensation strategy. The plan supports strategic compensation objectives by offering a range of awards including performance-based restricted stock units, which could result in up to 399,798 shares being issued if maximum performance goals are achieved over a three-year period. Financially, Boeing expects to fund these issuances from treasury shares, which they believe are sufficient for 2024, indicating alignment with cash management and capital allocation priorities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [BA](page_97) \u2192 [2023 Incentive Stock Plan]: The plan permits various forms of equity awards and authorizes 12,900,000 shares, plus undelivered shares from the 2003 plan; Boeing expects to fund future issuances from treasury shares, which are currently sufficient.",
        "Hop 2: [BA](page_126) \u2192 [2023 Incentive Stock Plan]: The plan is explicitly listed in Exhibit 10.17, showing it is a formalized, current compensation vehicle replacing the 2003 plan, which had been amended and restated multiple times.",
        "Hop 3: [BA](page_124) \u2192 [2023 Incentive Stock Plan]: Performance-based awards under the plan could result in up to 399,798 shares being issued if maximum performance goals are met, indicating potential equity dilution impact tied to performance metrics."

      "question": "How does Boeing's exposure to labor instability across its supply chain, workforce, and major fixed-price contracts collectively impact its ability to maintain profitability and meet delivery commitments?",
      "answer": "Boeing faces significant exposure to labor instability across multiple dimensions. From a supply chain perspective, labor instability among suppliers has already contributed to production delays and increased costs, with potential for material unavailability or price spikes (e.g., aluminum, titanium) to further disrupt operations. Internally, 33% of Boeing's workforce is union-represented, and past work stoppages (e.g., 2008 strike) demonstrate the risk of production halts that could strain customer relationships and reduce revenues. This instability is directly reflected in major fixed-price contracts like the 777X, KC-46A, and T-7A programs, where factory performance issues tied to labor instability have driven increases in reach-forward losses by hundreds of millions of dollars. Collectively, these factors create a compounding risk to both profitability and timely delivery, especially in programs already operating at near break-even margins.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [BA](page_11) \u2192 [Labor Instability]: Labor instability among suppliers and within Boeing's own union-represented workforce (33% of total) poses a risk to production continuity and cost control, with potential for work stoppages and delivery delays.",
        "Hop 2: [BA](page_49) \u2192 [Labor Instability]: Labor instability is factored into cost estimates for major programs like the 777X and 787, which already operate at near break-even margins, making them highly sensitive to disruptions.",
        "Hop 3: [BA](page_86) \u2192 [Labor Instability]: Labor instability has directly contributed to increased reach-forward losses in major fixed-price contracts such as the 777X ($482M increase in 2023), KC-46A, and T-7A programs, reflecting real financial impacts."

      "answer": "Boeing's investment in the 777X program has increased significantly, with R&D expenses rising by $525 million in 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher expenditures on the program. This aligns with the financial risks identified in the audit of program accounting estimates, which emphasized the difficulty in predicting certification-related costs and the potential for material reach-forward losses if certification timelines slip. Additionally, the program incurred abnormal production costs of $513 million in 2023 due to paused production during 2022 and 2023, further highlighting the financial volatility and operational challenges associated with the 777X program. Together, these elements indicate a high-risk, high-investment scenario where ongoing R&D spending is exposed to both production disruptions and uncertain regulatory outcomes.",

This reconsolidation also reflects a change in 3M's financial statement consolidation policies, as the Aearo Entities were previously deconsolidated in 2022 and later brought back under 3M's consolidated financial statements following the dismissal of their bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, the reconsolidation affected restructuring impacts, as the Aearo Entities' deconsolidation in 2022 and reconsolidation in 2023 were each treated as separate divestiture and acquisition impacts, respectively, under 3M's restructuring and related charges framework.",

As used herein, the term '3M' or 'Company' refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| The financial statements consolidate all applicable subsidiaries; intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. In the second quarter of 2023, 3M re-consolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of their voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022. See additional information in Note 18.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States, with the exception of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, which are not material to 3M. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Certain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)). Also effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M's Consumer business segment re- aligned from four divisions to three divisions, see additional information in Note 21. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of these changes, see additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Investments: 3M invests in marketable and equity securities. Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balances associated with equity securities are disclosed in Note 7.                                                |\n| 3M regularly reviews investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, an impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. These software amounts are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within PPE. Depreciation of PPE generally is computed using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 7 for depreciable life and additional details on PPE. Internal-use software elements of PPE are depreciated over a period of three to seven years. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of PPE and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows. |",

      "question": "How does MMM's capital investment and workforce size in Europe, Middle East and Africa compare to their sales performance in the region, and what might this suggest about operational efficiency or market positioning?",
      "answer": "MMM's capital investment in Europe, Middle East and Africa was $283 million in 2023, with 18,000 employees as of December 31, 2023. This level of investment and workforce contributed to generating $5,843 million in net sales for the region during the same year. Comparing these figures to the $1,713 million in net property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2023, suggests that MMM is generating a relatively strong sales return on both its capital investment and its human resources in the region.

The company still has $3 million in unrecognized compensation expense tied to these shares, expected to be recognized over 20 months (page 106). These shares are granted based on a three-year performance period with payout ranging from 0% to 200% depending on achievement of metrics like organic sales growth, free cash flow growth, and earnings per share growth (page 105). This indicates a strong linkage between executive compensation and long-term shareholder value creation, with significant financial obligations still pending recognition.",

      "answer": "3M uses foreign currency denominated debt as part of its strategy to hedge portions of the company's net investments in foreign operations, as outlined in the financial instruments section. This aligns with the fair value measurement approach described in the fair value disclosures, where the debt used as a hedging instrument is marked to value based on changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates. The pretax gains or losses from this debt, as reported in the cumulative translation adjustments within other comprehensive income, show a fluctuating impact over the past three years, with a loss of $86 million in 2023, a gain of $162 million in 2022, and a gain of $296 million in 2021, reflecting the dynamic nature of foreign exchange rate changes and their effect on the company's financial position.",

      "answer": "Boeing's discussion of labor instability across the three sections reveals a multi-faceted financial impact on both the 777X and T-7A Red Hawk programs. In production (page 39), labor instability is cited as a contributing factor to higher production costs and delivery delays for the 777X, resulting in a $2,608 million reach-forward loss in Q3 and an additional $891 million in Q4 due to the new IAM 751 agreement. In the accounting section (page 51), labor instability is explicitly factored into the estimation of long-term contract costs and revenues, which directly affects the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments and reach-forward losses\u2014like those seen on the T-7A Red Hawk program. Finally, in the supply chain section (page 34), labor instability is linked to supplier cost increases, which contributed to a $1,770 million reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program. Together, these perspectives show that labor instability has a cascading effect\u2014impacting production timelines, cost estimation accuracy, and supplier cost structures\u2014thereby significantly affecting the financial outlook of key programs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe are currently targeting a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777X  programs hav ing resumed production in December 2024. In July 2024, we obtained approv al from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. Flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, based on flight test delays and our rev ised assessment of certification timelines, the anticipated first deliv ery of the 7779 was delayed to 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter mov ed to 2028. First deliv ery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. In addition, we decided to slow the production rate ramp of 777X  to address production challenges, which resulted in higher production costs and further customer deliv ery delays. As a result of these changes, as well as higher estimated labor and supplier costs, we recorded a $2,608 million reach-forward loss during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X  program primarily due to higher costs as a result of the new IAM 751 agreement.\n\nWe are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nThe lev el of profitability on the 777X  program will be subject to sev eral factors. T hese factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, deliv ery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X  or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n787 Program T he  accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and deliv ering airplanes. During 2024, we slowed production to below 5 per month due to supply chain constraints as well as other production issues.  While we continue to be impacted by performance challenges and supply chain constraints, we are working  to  increase  production  rates.  Delays  associated  with  business  class  seats  adv ersely  impacted  2024  deliv eries  and  will  continue  to  impact deliv eries in 2025.

We expect to complete the rework and deliv er the majority of these aircraft in 2025.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\n## Accounting for Long-term Contracts\n\nSubstantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or serv ices and the significant serv ice of integration that we prov ide.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts inv olv es a judgmental process of estimating the total rev enue, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and rev enue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\n\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total rev enues and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many v ariables. T otal rev enue estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract  options,  change  orders,  incentiv e  and  award  fee  prov isions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  as inflation  or  index-based  clauses).  T he  majority  of  these  long-term  contracts  are  with  the  U.S.  gov ernment  where  the  price  is  generally  based  on  the estimated  cost  to  produce  the  product  or  serv ice  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  prov ide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  T otal  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, supply chain delays and quality issues, business v olume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.\n\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant  long-term  contract  performance  obligations  are  rev iewed  and  reassessed  quarterly.  Changes  in  these estimates could result in recognition of cumulativ e catch-up adjustments to the contract's inception to date rev enues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in rev enue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reachforward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. Net cumulativ e catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated rev enues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact of estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $6,562 million, $2,943 million and $5,253 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely, and were primarily due to losses recognized on the KC-46A T anker, T -7A Red Hawk, Commercial Crew, VC-25B, and MQ-25 programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described abov e, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change.  For  example,  changes  in  underlying  operational  assumptions,  inability  to implement  planned  risk  mitigation  plans,  failure  to  achiev e  productiv ity  targets,  supplier  shortages,  quality  issues  and/or  pricing  issues,  inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adv ersely affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts  had  been  estimated  to  be  higher  or  lower  by  1%  during  2024,  it  would  hav e  increased  or  decreased  pre-tax  income  for  the  year  by approximately $290 million.\n\n## Program Accounting\n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate rev enues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number",

This financial pressure is compounded by ongoing certification delays and regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the FAA, which has slowed down the program's timeline and introduced uncertainty around its market entry (page 52). Additionally, production rate constraints\u2014partly due to quality control issues and external disruptions like labor instability\u2014have further hindered Boeing\u2019s ability to scale production efficiently and meet delivery commitments (page 9).

The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.\n\nFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, production rates, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, ov erhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs.  Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account sev eral factors that are indicativ e of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospectiv e customers and market studies. T otal estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undeliv ered units under contract. T he sales prices for all  undeliv ered  units  within  the  accounting  quantity  include  an  escalation  adjustment  for  inflation  that  is  updated  quarterly,  as  well  as  customer consideration driv en by deliv ery delays. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economic  projections.  Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  the  timing  of  production  rate  increases, internal  and  supplier  performance  trends,  production  quality,  labor  instability,  supply  chain  delays  and  quality  issues,  learning  curv e,  change incorporation, rework or safety enhancements, regulatory requirements, flight test and certification requirements and schedules, performance or reliability issues inv olv ing  completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. Certain production rate increases require regulatory approv al. For example, during 2024, the FAA communicated it will not approv e production rate increases for the 737 program beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. If we are unable to increase production rates consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted.\n\nThe introduction of new aircraft and deriv ativ es, such as the 777X , 737-7 and 737-10, inv olv es increased risks associated with meeting dev elopment, certification, and production schedules. T hese challenges include significant global regulatory scrutiny of all dev elopment aircraft. We hav e experienced significant  certification  delays  with  the  777X ,  737-7  and  737-10  aircraft. As  a  result,  our  ability  to  deliv er  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  performance  and reliability standards and achiev e or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification processes for the 777X , 737-7 and 737-10 models and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nT o  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  rev iewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  T his  includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospectiv e basis; howev er, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inv entory exceed estimated rev enues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undeliv ered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nThe 777X  and 767 programs recognized earnings charges totaling $3,499 million and $580 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. Adv erse changes to the rev enue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in further earnings charges in future periods. Lower production rates and the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement as well as pay enhancements for certain other non-union employees hav e also pressured margins on other commercial airplane programs.\n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described abov e, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins.

We have experienced and may continue to experience production quality issues, including in our supply chain.\n\nFor example, as a result of the Alaska Airlines 737-9 accident in January 2024, the FAA inv estigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit, and increased its ov ersight of our production and quality and safety management systems. The FAA identified multiple instances where we and Spirit failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. As part of our plan to improv e safety and quality and to address the issues identified by the FAA, we slowed 737 production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce trav eled work in our factory and at our suppliers.

If production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliv er components that comply with design specifications to us at the cost and rates necessary to achiev e our targets, we may be unable to meet deliv ery schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.\n\nOperational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in additional production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new  aircraft, either of w hich w ould negatively impact our revenues and operating margins.

The decrease is primarily due to higher net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up  adjustments  of  $909  million  on  BDS'  fiv e  major  fixed-price  dev elopment  programs.  Ov erall,  net  unfav orable  cumulativ e  contract  catch-up adjustments in 2024 were $995 million higher than 2023.\n\nBDS  revenues  in  2023  increased  by  $1,771  million  compared  with  2022.  Rev enues  related  to  BDS'  fiv e  major  fixed-price  dev elopment  programs increased by $1,767 million in 2023 compared with 2022. This increase reflects lower unfav orable net cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 as well as higher costs incurred in 2023 to complete these contracts. Net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments in 2023 were $648 million better than in 2022 largely due to lower charges on dev elopment programs in 2023, partially offset by unfav orable performance on other programs.\n\n## Loss From Operations\n\nBDS loss from operations in 2024 was $5,413 million compared with $1,764 million in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments of $3,428 million on BDS' fiv e major fixed-price dev elopment programs compared to 2023. During 2024, losses incurred on the fiv e major fixed-price dev elopment programs totaled $5,013 million, including KC-46A T anker ($2,002 million), T -7A Red Hawk ($1,770 million), Commercial Crew ($523 million), VC-25B ($379 million), and MQ-25 ($339 million). Net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments were $3,534 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year. See further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBDS loss from operations in 2023 of $1,764 million decreased by $1,780 million compared with $3,544 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to $2,863 million of lower charges in 2023 on fixed-price dev elopment programs that were partially offset by lower earnings across other programs including satellites and F-15, as well as higher period expenses. During 2023, losses incurred on the fiv e fixed-price dev elopment programs totaled $1,585 million compared with $4,448 million in 2022.  Charges on fixed-price dev elopment programs in 2023 included  VC-25B ($482 million),  KC-46A  T anker ($309 million), Commercial Crew ($288 million), T-7A Red Hawk ($275 million) and MQ-25 ($231 million). Loss from operations in 2023 includes a $315 million impact from an agreement with one of our satellite customers which includes customer considerations as well as increased costs to enhance the",

Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\n\n## MQ-25\n\nIn  the  third  quarter  of  2018,  we  were  awarded  the  MQ-25  EMD  contract  by  the  U.S.  Nav y.  T he  contract  is  a  fixed-price  contract  that  now  includes development and deliv ery  of sev en aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $890.  In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 in the third quarter of 2018. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $231. In the first quarter of 2024, we were awarded a cost-type contract modification totaling $657 for two additional test aircraft plus other scope increases. During 2024, we increased the reachforward loss by $339. During the third quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $217 primarily reflecting higher than anticipated production costs to complete EMD aircraft. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $122, primarily reflecting costs associated with ongoing design and software dev elopment challenges. The initial EMD units are currently progressing through the factory and the increase reflects recent  and  projected  factory  performance  as  well  as  the  higher  than  anticipated  complexity  of  the  production  build.  We  expect  the  initial  units  to complete production in 2025 and begin flight testing. We will be initiating final assembly operations at our new facility at Mid-America St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois, in 2025. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\n\n## T-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract &amp; Production Options\n\nIn 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract is a $860 fixed-price contract and includes fiv e aircraft and seven simulators. The production portion of the contract includes production lots for 346 T -7A Red Hawk aircraft and related serv ices that we believ e are probable of being exercised. The fiv e EMD aircraft hav e been deliv ered as of December 31, 2024, and the flight testing is ongoing.\n\nDuring 2024 and 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $1,770 and $275. The increase in 2024 primarily reflects higher estimated supplier costs related to future production lots. During the first quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $94  primarily reflecting increases in production costs. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the program by $278 primarily driv en by higher than anticipated costs to meet certain technical and support requirements. During the third quarter of 2024, we increased the loss on the program by $908 primarily to reflect higher estimated supplier costs related to future production lots. T he higher estimated supplier costs were based on our  updated  assessment  that  prev iously  assumed  cost  estimates  are  not  projected  to  be  realized  in  the  current  env ironment  based  on  ongoing contracting activ ity and discussions with suppliers. T he rev ised estimates include priced options or not-to-exceed pricing for contractually committed suppliers  and  escalated  current  prices  for  uncontracted  work.  We  also  prov isioned  for  a  supplier  not  fulfilling  their  contractual  requirements,  and  for certain equipment no longer assumed to be customer-furnished for certain production lots. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we further increased the reach-forward loss by $490 primarily reflecting increased supplier pricing based on new pricing proposals and supplier negotiations. The fourth quarter charge also includes higher costs to complete the flight test program to achiev e final certification. At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $315 of capitalized precontract costs and $632 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to certain long-lead items for the first 4 production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\n\n## Commercial Crew\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport crews to the International Space Station (ISS) and in the second quarter of 2022, we successfully completed the uncrewed Orbital Flight Test.

T he communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below , prov iding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs more fully described in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes rev enue ov er time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or serv ices are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and rev enue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion inv olv es estimating the costs to  complete  production  of  goods  or  rendering  of  serv ices  and  comparing  those  costs  to  the  estimated  final  rev enue  amount.  Margins  on  fixed-price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that rev enue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant  v ariability.  T he  operational  and  technical  complexities  of  fixed-price  dev elopment  contracts  create  financial  risk,  which  could  increase  the estimates  of  costs  and  result  in  lower  margins  or  material  reach-forward  losses.  T he  ongoing  effects  of  supply  chain  and  operational  inefficiencies compound these complexities and related financial risks.\n\nGiven  the  operational  and  technical  complexities  of  certain  of  the  Company's  fixed-price  dev elopment  contracts,  including  the  KC-46A  T anker, Commercial  Crew ,  VC-25B  Presidential Aircraft,  T -7A  Redhawk,  and  MQ-25  contracts  and  the  limited  amount  of  historical  data  av ailable  in  certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates inv olv ed extensiv e audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A T anker, Commercial Crew , VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, T-7A Redhawk, and MQ-25 fixed-price dev elopment contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods used in dev eloping its cost estimates.\n- We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the effects of supply chain and labor disruptions.  We also ev aluated the range and probabilities of reasonably possible outcomes, and where management set its point estimate within the range.\n- We evaluated the appropriateness of the timing of the incorporation of changes to key cost estimates, including ev aluating the timeline of key events and knowledge points that led to management's determination that a change in estimate was necessary.\n- We inquired of project management, engineers, supply chain leadership, and others directly inv olv ed with the execution of contracts to ev aluate management's ability to achiev e the key",

      "question": "How does GE's liquidity policy and capital allocation strategy align with its ongoing exposure to Bank BPH's mortgage litigation liabilities, particularly in light of the $1,797 million in non-cash capital contributions made in 2023 and the risk of future cash contributions?",
      "answer": "GE's liquidity policy emphasizes maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. This aligns with its management of exposure to Bank BPH, where it made $1,797 million in non-cash capital contributions during 2023 to maintain regulatory capital levels, avoiding the need for incremental cash contributions. However, the company still faces potential future liquidity demands due to the $2,669 million estimated total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH as of December 31, 2023. GE's capital allocation strategy, which includes a focus on sustainable investment-grade financial policies, must account for such legacy exposures, especially since run-off financial services operations\u2014including Bank BPH\u2014pose long-term risks that could require additional capital infusions under adverse developments.

This strategic move aligns with GE's broader investment management approach in its run-off insurance operations, where investments are managed under strict guidelines including asset class concentration limits and credit quality considerations to meet long-duration insurance liabilities. The sale contributed to an increase in the estimated fair value of investment securities by year-end, driven in part by the mark-to-market effect and new investments, despite the reduction from the AerCap share sales.",

      "answer": "GE's relationship with AerCap is reflected in three key areas: (1) In discontinued operations, GE disclosed a $203 million net cash payment to AerCap in 2023 related to ongoing sales, leases, and transition services. (2) In investment activity, GE reported a $129 million realized and unrealized gain on its AerCap investment in 2023, a significant improvement from the $865 million loss in 2022. (3) In corporate operating profit, the 2023 increase of $6.7 billion was partly driven by $5.7 billion in higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, primarily from AerCap and GE HealthCare. Together, these perspectives show that AerCap played a material role in GE's financial turnaround in 2023, both through direct investment gains and strategic post-divestiture financial flows.",

      "question": "How does GE's operational risk discussion around gas turbines reconcile with their segment performance data and internal product categorization structure?",
      "answer": "GE's operational risk section (page 32) highlights that gas turbines are part of complex industrial machinery where quality issues can lead to significant financial and reputational damage, citing examples like warranty costs and fleet availability problems. In the Power segment (page 11), gas turbines are positioned as a core product line under Gas Power, with organic revenue growth noted, yet the segment still reports losses tied to project execution challenges. Meanwhile, page 12 clarifies that gas turbines are internally categorized into subsets like Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines and HA-Turbines, suggesting a nuanced product architecture that likely influences both risk exposure and performance metrics. Synthesizing these perspectives, GE faces execution risks in delivering technically complex gas turbine systems, which are reflected in segment performance volatility, even as the company maintains a structured approach to product classification and development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE (page_32) \u2192 Gas Turbines: Operational risks include quality issues, warranty costs, and fleet availability problems, with specific mention of gas turbines as part of complex industrial infrastructure.",
        "Hop 2: GE (page_12) \u2192 Gas Turbines: Internal product categorization shows gas turbines are segmented into subsets like Heavy-Duty and HA-Turbines, indicating a layered product architecture.",
        "Hop 3: GE (page_11) \u2192 Gas Turbines: Gas Power is a key part of the Power segment, which reports revenue growth but ongoing losses, partly due to project execution challenges tied to new product ramp-ups."

      "answer": "Union Pacific utilizes multiple non-GAAP financial measures governed by SEC Regulation G to assess various dimensions of its financial health. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA, discussed in the liquidity section, reflects the company's ability to service debt using operational cash flow, with adjusted EBITDA incorporating lease interest and tax adjustments. ROIC, mentioned in the performance metrics, evaluates the efficiency of long-term capital investments and is tied to executive compensation, indicating strategic importance. Cash flow conversion, presented in operating activities, measures the company's ability to generate cash from operations relative to net income, excluding capital expenditures. Together, these metrics under SEC Regulation G provide a multi-dimensional view of Union Pacific\u2019s financial sustainability, capital efficiency, and operational cash generation.",

      "question": "What is the operational and administrative significance of Omaha, Nebraska to Union Pacific Corporation, considering its headquarters footprint, dispatching operations, and the location of its independent auditor's opinion on internal controls?",
      "answer": "Omaha, Nebraska holds significant operational and administrative importance for Union Pacific Corporation. The company owns a 1.2 million square foot headquarters building in Omaha, which accommodates approximately 4,000 employees, making it a central hub for corporate administration. Additionally, Omaha is home to the Harriman Dispatching Center (HDC), where around 500 employees coordinate locomotive and train movements, manage traffic, and oversee crew operations across the network. This facility is critical for real-time rail operations and interchanges with other railroads. Furthermore, Omaha serves as the location from which Deloitte & Touche LLP issued its independent auditor\u2019s opinion on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, indicating the city's role in the corporation\u2019s financial governance and external accountability.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's reliance on leased locomotives, as detailed in their lease portfolio, interact with their supplier concentration risk and equipment inventory strategy to shape their operational flexibility in maintaining a modern and compliant locomotive fleet as of December 31, 2023?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific's operational flexibility in maintaining a modern and compliant locomotive fleet is shaped by the interplay of three key factors. First, as of December 31, 2023, the company leases a significant portion of its locomotives, as noted in the lease portfolio details, which directly affects fleet size and composition. Second, the company faces supplier concentration risk, as the locomotive market has high barriers to entry and a limited number of domestic suppliers capable of meeting regulatory emissions standards; if one supplier discontinues operations, it could lead to cost increases and reduced availability of compliant locomotives. Third, the company's equipment inventory includes both owned and leased units, indicating a mixed strategy for fleet management. Together, these factors suggest that Union Pacific must carefully balance leasing commitments with supplier risk to ensure it can maintain and modernize its locomotive fleet in line with regulatory requirements and operational needs.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's use of non-GAAP financial measures like ROIC, adjusted debt-to-EBITDA, and cash flow conversion rate collectively reflect their approach to capital allocation and financial performance evaluation?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific utilizes multiple non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its financial health and capital allocation strategy. ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) is used to assess the efficiency of long-term capital investments and serves as a performance criterion for executive compensation. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDA, which includes operating lease liabilities and pension obligations, is used to evaluate the company's ability to sustain debt levels with operating cash flow and is monitored by rating agencies. The cash flow conversion rate, calculated as operating cash flow minus capital investments relative to net income, measures the company's ability to generate cash without external financing. These metrics\u2014each defined in a way that may differ from other companies\u2014are reconciled to GAAP equivalents and provide a comprehensive view of Union Pacific's financial strategy, from investment effectiveness to debt management and operational cash generation.",

      "answer": "Emerson's acquisition of AspenTech in fiscal 2022, where it obtained a 55% ownership stake, directly shaped its segment reporting, as AspenTech is listed as a distinct segment with a balance of $8,329 million as of September 30, 2024. This aligns with AspenTech's role in contract revenue recognition, where it contributed approximately $635 million in 2024 revenue recognized from beginning contract liabilities, underscoring its importance in Emerson\u2019s software licensing and long-term contract performance. Strategically, AspenTech remains a core component of Emerson\u2019s capital allocation and growth strategy, evidenced by the lack of change in AspenTech\u2019s segment balance between 2023 and 2024 despite major acquisitions in other segments, suggesting a stable and intentional long-term investment in AspenTech\u2019s industrial software capabilities.",

Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's prev ious name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.'

Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022. Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying v alue of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\n## GAIN ON SUBORDINATED INTEREST\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company receiv ed a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv  (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter of 2022, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share) and receiv ed the remaining $15 related to the pretax gain in the first quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Company receiv ed additional distributions totaling $161 ($122 after-tax, $0.21 per share) and in 2024, receiv ed its final distribution of $79 ($60 after-tax, $0.10 per share).\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $1,434 in 2024, an increase of $928 compared with 2023. The current year included intangibles amortization related to the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition of $560, while restructuring costs increased by $156 and acquisition/div estiture costs increased by $27. The Company also incurred div estiture losses of $48 ($50 after-tax, $0.09 per share).\n\nOther deductions, net were $506 in 2023, a decrease of $13 compared with 2022, and included higher intangibles amortization of $146 primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an unfav orable impact from foreign currency transactions of $112 reflecting losses in the current year compared to gains in the prior year.

From an operational performance perspective, the acquisition contributed $752 million in sales during 2023, up from $356 million in 2022. In terms of restructuring, AspenTech's activities included a mark-to-market gain of $24 million in 2023 related to foreign currency forward contracts tied to the Micromine purchase price, though these contracts were terminated in June 2023. On the financing side, Emerson repaid $264 million related to AspenTech's existing term loan facility in 2023 and used approximately $6.0 billion in cash to fund the acquisition, which was partially financed through increased commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt issued in December 2021.

The decrease in 2024 reflected the repayment of \u20ac500 of 0.375% euro notes that matured in May 2024. The decrease in 2023 included a net reduction in short-term borrowings of approximately $1.6 billion and repayments of long-term debt of $741 (including $264 related to AspenTech's repayment of the outstanding balance on its existing term loan facility plus accrued interest). Activ ity in 2022 included the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt and increased commercial paper borrowings of approximately $1.3 billion. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and the increased commercial paper borrowings to fund the majority of its contribution of approximately $6.0 billion to existing stockholders of Heritage AspenTech as part of the transaction. Long-term debt was issued in December 2021 as follows: $1 billion of 2.0% notes due December 2028, $1 billion of 2.2% notes due December 2031, and $1 billion of 2.8% notes due December 2051. Additionally, the Company repaid $500 of 2.625% notes that matured in 2022. See Note 4 and Note 13.\n\nThe total debt-to-total capital ratio decreased slightly in 2024, reflecting repayments of long-term debt, while the net debt-to-net capital ratio increased reflecting the use of cash held on the balance sheet at September 30, 2023 that was used to complete the NI acquisition. These ratios decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the proceeds and after-tax gains (which increased common stockholder's equity) on the Copeland transaction and InSinkErator div estiture. The interest cov erage ratio is computed as earnings before income taxes plus interest expense, div ided by interest expense. The decrease in 2024 reflects lower GAAP pretax earnings largely due to the NI acquisition. Excluding the impact from acquisition-related inv entory stepup amortization of $231, higher intangibles amortization of $595, acquisition/div estiture fees and related costs of $220, higher restructuring and related costs of $152, the loss of $279 on the Copeland note receiv able and the gain on the subordinated interest of $79, the interest cov erage ratio was 11.6X . The Company's earnings increased in 2023 which offset higher interest expense due to the increased long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings to fund the Heritage AspenTech acquisition.\n\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a $3.5 billion fiv e-year rev olv ing backup credit facility with v arious banks, which replaced the May 2018 $3.5 billion facility.

Net sales are recognized primarily from the sale of tangible products from hundreds of Company locations around the world. Ev aluating the sufficiency of audit ev idence obtained required especially subjectiv e auditor judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company's net sales generating activ ities. This included determining the Company locations at which procedures were performed and the superv ision and rev iew of procedures performed at those locations.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed ov er net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. At each Company location where procedures were performed, we:\n\n- Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiv eness of certain internal controls ov er the Company's net sales processes, including the Company's controls ov er the accurate recording of amounts.\n- Assessed the recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and shipping documentation.\n\n## Evaluation of the Acquisition Date Fair Value of Certain Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nAs discussed in Notes 4 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation for a total purchase consideration of $8.7 billion.

A high degree of subjectiv e and complex auditor judgment was required to ev aluate key assumptions used to v alue these acquired intangible assets. Specifically, key assumptions included projected rev enue and customer attrition for the customer relationships intangible asset and projected rev enue and obsolescence rates for the dev eloped technology intangible asset.

      "answer": "Emerson's acquisition of National Instruments increased its contract liabilities by approximately $150 million, indicating a direct impact on its balance sheet related to customer obligations. In the pro forma financials, the acquisition contributed $1,693 million in net sales for the prior fiscal year and incurred $88 million in transaction costs prior to the deal's completion. Additionally, the equity investment in National Instruments was valued using Level 1 fair value inputs based on quoted market prices as of September 30, 2023, showing that Emerson had a market-based valuation approach for its stake before full integration. Together, these figures illustrate how the acquisition affected Emerson's liabilities, historical revenue base, and investment valuation methods.",

Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. As a result of these transactions, the equity interest and note receiv able are reported as held-for-sale in the prior year, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and cash flows related to U.S. tax distributions hav e been reclassified to operating cash flows from discontinued operations (see Notes 5 and 8).\n\nIn 2024, the Company adopted ASU No. 2022-04 (Subtopic 405-50), Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs, which requires disclosures about the use of supplier finance programs. This standard has no impact on the accounting for supplier finance programs and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\n\nIn 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2021-10 (Topic 832), Government Assistance, which requires annual disclosures about certain types of government assistance receiv ed. This standard has no impact on the accounting for gov ernment assistance and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\n\nIn 2022, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates, each of which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:\n\n- Updates to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations , which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair v alue in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805.\n- Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes , which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations.\n- Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities , ASC 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when ev aluating observ able transactions.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled affiliates. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Inv estments of 20 percent to 50 percent of the v oting shares of other entities are accounted for by the equity method. Inv estments in publicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at fair v alue, with changes in fair v alue reflected in earnings. Inv estments in nonpublicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at cost, minus impairment, and adjusted for observ able price changes in orderly transactions.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe functional currency for most of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensiv e income.",

However, the facility's availability is sensitive to credit market instability, and a deterioration in Union Pacific\u2019s financial condition could result in a credit rating downgrade, potentially restricting or prohibiting its use of the facility.

COVID has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, resulting further in adverse  effects  on  workforces,  customers,  and  regional  and  local  economies.  Other  future  pandemics  or  public health crises may cause these same or similar consequences. Because the severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID pandemic and its economic consequences are rapidly changing, and difficult to predict, the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of the COVID pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors, which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control. These factors also may be of importance for other  pandemics  or  public  health  crises,  including,  but  not  limited  to:  governmental,  business,  and  individuals' actions  that  have  been  and  continue  to  be  taken  in  response  to  a  global  pandemic  or  other  public  health crises  (including  restrictions  on  travel  and  transport,  workforce  pressures,  social  distancing,  and  shelter-in-place orders); the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and their demand for our services; the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on the credit-worthiness of our customers; national or global supply chain challenges or disruption; facility closures; commodity cost volatility; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence. Further, a pandemic or other public health crises, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that  we  identify,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. Additionally, a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nWe  Are  Affected  By  Fluctuating  Fuel  Prices -  Fuel  costs  constitute  a  significant  portion  of  our  transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our  fuel  expenses  from  our  customers  through  revenue  from  fuel  surcharges,  we  cannot  be  certain  that  we  will always  be  able  to  mitigate  rising  or  elevated  fuel  costs  through  our  fuel  surcharges.  Additionally,  future  market conditions  or  legislative  or  regulatory  activities  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  apply  fuel  surcharges  or adequately  recover  increased  fuel  costs  through  fuel  surcharges.  As  fuel  prices  fluctuate,  our  fuel  surcharge programs  trail  such  fluctuations  in  fuel  price  by  approximately  two  months,  and  may  be  a  significant  source  of quarter-over-quarter  and  year-over-year  volatility,  particularly  in  periods  of  rapidly  changing  prices.  International, political, and economic factors, events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. A severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity. Alternatively, lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport. However, lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport, such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nWe Rely on Capital Markets - Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements. We utilize longterm debt instruments, bank financing, and commercial paper, and we pledge certain amount of our receivables as collateral  for  credit.  Significant  instability  or  disruptions  of  the  capital  markets,  including  the  credit  markets,  or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to, and significantly increase the cost of, commercial paper and other financing sources, including bank credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt, including corporate bonds. A significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could restrict or, at certain credit levels below investment grade, may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility  (Receivables Facility). This may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.\n\n## General Risk Factors\n\nWe Are Affected  by  General  Economic  Conditions -  Prolonged,  severe  adverse  domestic  and  global  economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets, including inflation, may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nWe May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of War - Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail  cars  carrying  hazardous  materials,  could  be  direct  targets  or  indirect  casualties  of  terrorist  attacks.  Terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future.",

Under the Receivables Facility, the Railroad sells most of its eligible third-party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc.

The  Receivables  Facility  was  supported  by  $1.3  billion  and  $1.2  billion  of  accounts  receivable  as collateral  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  which,  as  a  retained  interest,  is  included  in  accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nThe outstanding amount the Railroad maintains under the Receivables Facility may fluctuate based on current cash needs.  The  maximum  allowed  under  the  facility  is  $800  million  with  availability  directly  impacted  by  eligible receivables, business volumes, and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios.  If  default  or  dilution  ratios  increase  one  percent,  the  allowable  outstanding  amount  under  the Receivables Facility would not materially change.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's increased freight car rent expense in 2021, their capital plan commitment to freight car acquisitions in 2022, and their lease obligations disclosure relate to their broader operational efficiency goals and resource utilization strategy?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific experienced a rise in freight car rent expense in 2021 due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity, which reflects higher dependency on leased freight cars. In response, the company included targeted freight car acquisitions in its 2022 capital plan of $3.3 billion, aiming to reduce reliance on leased assets and improve resource utilization. Additionally, Union Pacific disclosed lease obligations for freight cars and other equipment, indicating a strategic awareness of the financial commitments tied to asset ownership versus leasing. Together, these elements show a shift toward balancing short-term leasing costs with long-term capital investments to enhance operational efficiency and reduce variability in freight car availability and cost.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses increased $767 million in 2021 compared to  2020  driven  by  higher  fuel  prices,  volume-related  costs, inflation,  higher  casualty  costs,  2020  management  actions, weather and wildfire-related expenses, incentive compensation,  and  higher  state  and  local  taxes.  Partially offsetting  these  increases  compared  to  2020  include  a  $278 million  impairment  charge  in  2020,  productivity  initiatives,  a one-time  bonus  payment  for  agreement  employees  in  2020, and lower severance costs. Full year results of 2021 and 2020 both include a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n2021 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits -  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension  costs,  and  incentive  costs.  In  2021,  expenses  increased  4%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  volume  related costs,  inflation,  2020  management  actions  responding  to  the  sharp  decline  in  volume  (temporary  unpaid  leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\n\nDepreciation -  The  majority  of  depreciation  relates  to  road  property,  including  rail,  ties,  ballast,  and  other  track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nFuel -  Fuel  includes  locomotive  fuel  and  gasoline  for  highway  and  non-highway  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared  to  $1.50  per  gallon  in  2020,  increased  expenses  $668  million  (excluding  any  impact  from  increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased  from  outside  contractors  and  other  service  providers  (including  equipment  maintenance  and  contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad's lines, structures, and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile  maintenance  expenses;  and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  services  and  materials  increased  3%  in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with  our  intermodal  business,  higher  costs  due  to  weather  and  wildfire-related  events,  increased  locomotive  and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\n\nEquipment  and  Other  Rents -  Equipment  and  other  rents  expense  primarily  includes  rental  expense  that  the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;  and  office  and  other  rent  expenses,  offset  by  equity  income  from  certain  equity  method  investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and  higher  equity  income  from  our  investment  in  TTX  Company,  partially  offset  by  increased  freight  car  rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\n\nOther - Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal  injury,  environmental,  employee  travel,  telephone  and  cellular,  computer  software,  bad  debt,  and  other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million noncash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital  projects,  2020  lease  impairments,  and  higher  equity  income.  Partially  offsetting  these  decreases  were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local  taxes.  Both  periods  in  2021  and  2020  included  a  reduction  of  expense  for  weather  and  wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\n- Safety - Operating a safe railroad benefits all our constituents: our employees, customers, shareholders, and the communities we serve. We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety utilizing technology, risk assessments, training, employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments. As mentioned previously, our initiatives will be informed by recommendations identified in the third-party assessment of the effectiveness of our safety program. Consistent with these recommendations, we will continually evaluate and adjust  deployment  of  Total  Safety  Culture,  Courage  to  Care,  COMMIT,  and  Peer  to  Peer  throughout  our operations, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. In addition,  our  Operating  Practices  Command  Center  will  continue  the  implementation  of  our  predictive technology and reduce variability by identifying causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions, in  addition  to,  assisting  employees  with  understanding  policies,  procedures,  and  best  practices  for  handling trains. We will continue our efforts to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs, and local community activities across  the  network.  We  also  are  dedicated  to  maintaining  a  healthy  workplace  and  continue  monitoring  the COVID case levels, modifying our policies as needed to protect employees and minimize the risk of workplace transmission.\n- Network Operations - In 2022, we will continue transforming our railroad to increase reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, and improve resource utilization. Further train length initiatives allow us to efficiently add incremental volume growth to our existing train network. We will continue to make capital investments to improve operational performance and efficiency. A more efficient network requires fewer locomotives, freight cars, and other resources.\n- Financial  Expectations -  We  expect  volume  to  outpace  industrial  production  in  2022  as  the  results  of  our business development efforts are bringing new customers to our railroad. In the current environment, we expect continued margin improvement driven by pricing in excess of inflation and ongoing efficiency initiatives, better leveraging  our  resources  and  improving  our  service  product.  We  expect  to  generate  strong  cash  flow  from operating  activities  allowing  us  to  continue  our  industry  leading  dividend  payout  ratio  and  strong  share repurchase  programs.  Economic  uncertainties  remain  in  2022  as  COVID  impacts  linger  and  could  have  a material impact on our 2022 financial and operating results. Regardless of external factors, we will focus on efficiently managing operations; seeking new business opportunities; protecting our employees, customers, and communities; and providing excellent service to our customers.\n- Market Conditions - While current forecasts for industrial production indicate continued economic growth, we expect uncertainties with COVID and the economy to continue in 2022. How governments and consumers react to  the  resurgence,  mutation  of  the  virus,  and  vaccine  mandates  could  result  in  or  contribute  to  customer disruptions, an elongated recovery period, constrained workforce availability, or a general economic downturn from current levels. Disruptions in our customers' supply chains caused by the pandemic or other factors may continue  to  impact  our  shipments.  In  addition,  other  factors  such  as  changes  in  monetary  policy  may  affect economic activity and demand for rail transportation; natural gas prices, weather conditions, and demand for other  energy  sources  may  impact  the  coal  market;  crude  oil  price  spreads  may  drive  demand  for  petroleum products and drilling materials; available truck capacity could impact our intermodal business; and international trade agreements could promote or hinder trade.\n- Fuel Prices -  Projections  for  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  continue  to  fluctuate  in  the  current  environment.  We again could see volatile fuel prices during the year, as they are sensitive to global and U.S. domestic demand, refining capacity, geopolitical events, weather conditions, and other factors. As prices fluctuate, there will be a timing  impact  on  earnings,  as  our  fuel  surcharge  programs  trail  increases  or  decreases  in  fuel  price  by approximately two months.\n- Significant changes in fuel prices could have an impact on consumer discretionary spending, impacting demand for  various  consumer  products  we  transport.  Alternatively,  those  changes  could  have  an  inverse  impact  on commodities such as coal, petroleum products, and domestic drilling-related shipments.\n- Capital Plan - In 2022, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion, up 10% from 2021 as we make investments to support our growth strategy. We will continue to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resilience of the network. In addition, the plan includes targeted freight car acquisitions,  investments  in  growth-related  projects  to  drive  more  carloads  to  the  network,  certain  ramps  to efficiently  handle  volumes  from  new  and  existing  intermodal  customers,  continuous  modernization  of  our locomotive  fleet,  and  projects  intended  to  improve  operational  efficiency.  The  capital  plan  may  be  revised  if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.

      "answer": "Union Pacific utilized the Receivables Facility as part of a diversified liquidity strategy, drawing $300 million against the $800 million facility by the end of 2021, which was also reflected in the company's debt disclosures as a $300 million obligation. This facility served as a key source of liquidity alongside commercial paper and revolving credit, especially as access to capital markets could be constrained by external factors. The facility was supported by $1.3 billion in accounts receivable, indicating a conservative collateralization approach. This aligns with the company's broader capital structure, where the Receivables Facility provided flexibility without materially increasing risk, even under stress scenarios like a 1% rise in default or dilution ratios.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the  impact  on  our  ability  to  generate  cash.  These  analyses  inform  our  liquidity  plans  and  activities  outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities. At December 31, 2020, we had a surplus due to an increased cash balance held due to the uncertainty related to COVID. It is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit, and we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. We also maintain adequate  resources,  including  our  credit  facility  and,  when  necessary,  access  the  capital  markets  to  meet  any foreseeable cash requirements.\n\nDuring the year, we generated $9.0 billion of cash from operating activities, completed a $1.7 billion debt exchange, and issued $3.5 billion of long-term debt. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt  covenants.  We  increased  the  dividend  twice  during  2021  paying  out  $2.8  billion  and  repurchased  shares totaling $7.3 billion, including the completion of our $2 billion accelerated share repurchase programs entered into on May 25, 2021.\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, our Receivables Facility, our revolving credit facility, as  well  as  the  availability  of  commercial  paper  and  other  sources  of  financing  through  the  capital  markets.  On December 31, 2021, we had $960 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of committed credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $500 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2021, none of the revolving credit facility was drawn, and we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during  2021.  At  December  31,  2021,  we  had  $300  million  of  the  Receivables  Facility  drawn,  $400  million  of commercial  paper,  and  a  $100  million  term  loan  outstanding.  Our  access  to  the  Receivables  Facility  may  be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the utilization of our Receivables Facility, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. The Company's $2.0 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short-term needs. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.\n\nAs described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), there is no known  trend,  demand,  commitment,  event,  or  uncertainty  that  is  reasonably  likely  to  occur  that  would  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  or  liquidity.  In  addition,  our commercial  obligations,  financings,  and  commitments  are  customary  transactions  that  are  like  those  of  other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.\n\nThe following table identifies material obligations as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

See Note 5 for additional details.\n\n## 10. Accounts Receivable\n\nAccounts  receivable  includes  freight  and  other  receivables  reduced  by  an  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our accounts receivable were reduced by $10 million and $17 million, respectively. Receivables not expected to be collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Receivables  classified  as  other  assets  were  reduced  by allowances of $51 million at both  December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nReceivables Securitization Facility - The Railroad maintains an $800 million, 3-year receivables securitization facility (the Receivables Facility) maturing in July 2022. Under the Receivables Facility, the Railroad sells most of its eligible third-party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a consolidated, wholly-owned, bankruptcyremote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse, an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors.  The  investors  have  no  recourse  to  the  Railroad's  other  assets  except  for  customary  warranty  and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI.\n\nThe amount recorded under the Receivables Facility was $300 million and $0 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The  Receivables  Facility  was  supported  by  $1.3  billion  and  $1.2  billion  of  accounts  receivable  as collateral  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  which,  as  a  retained  interest,  is  included  in  accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nThe outstanding amount the Railroad maintains under the Receivables Facility may fluctuate based on current cash needs.  The  maximum  allowed  under  the  facility  is  $800  million  with  availability  directly  impacted  by  eligible receivables, business volumes, and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios.  If  default  or  dilution  ratios  increase  one  percent,  the  allowable  outstanding  amount  under  the Receivables Facility would not materially change.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's commitment to rail efficiency as part of its environmental stewardship strategy reconcile with the significant year-over-year increase in locomotive fuel costs and its contractual obligations for rail infrastructure purchases?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific emphasizes rail efficiency as a core component of its environmental stewardship, noting that rail transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75% compared to trucking (page 13). However, this commitment faces financial challenges as evidenced by a $668 million increase in locomotive fuel costs in 2021 due to rising diesel prices from $1.50 to $2.23 per gallon (page 38). Additionally, the company has binding purchase obligations that include commitments for rail infrastructure components such as ties, ballast, and rail (page 43), which suggest ongoing capital expenditures to maintain and improve rail efficiency. These financial pressures highlight the tension between maintaining environmental leadership and managing the rising operational and capital costs associated with rail infrastructure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses increased $767 million in 2021 compared to  2020  driven  by  higher  fuel  prices,  volume-related  costs, inflation,  higher  casualty  costs,  2020  management  actions, weather and wildfire-related expenses, incentive compensation,  and  higher  state  and  local  taxes.  Partially offsetting  these  increases  compared  to  2020  include  a  $278 million  impairment  charge  in  2020,  productivity  initiatives,  a one-time  bonus  payment  for  agreement  employees  in  2020, and lower severance costs. Full year results of 2021 and 2020 both include a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n2021 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits -  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension  costs,  and  incentive  costs.  In  2021,  expenses  increased  4%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  volume  related costs,  inflation,  2020  management  actions  responding  to  the  sharp  decline  in  volume  (temporary  unpaid  leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\n\nDepreciation -  The  majority  of  depreciation  relates  to  road  property,  including  rail,  ties,  ballast,  and  other  track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nFuel -  Fuel  includes  locomotive  fuel  and  gasoline  for  highway  and  non-highway  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared  to  $1.50  per  gallon  in  2020,  increased  expenses  $668  million  (excluding  any  impact  from  increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased  from  outside  contractors  and  other  service  providers  (including  equipment  maintenance  and  contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad's lines, structures, and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile  maintenance  expenses;  and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  services  and  materials  increased  3%  in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with  our  intermodal  business,  higher  costs  due  to  weather  and  wildfire-related  events,  increased  locomotive  and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\n\nEquipment  and  Other  Rents -  Equipment  and  other  rents  expense  primarily  includes  rental  expense  that  the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;  and  office  and  other  rent  expenses,  offset  by  equity  income  from  certain  equity  method  investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and  higher  equity  income  from  our  investment  in  TTX  Company,  partially  offset  by  increased  freight  car  rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\n\nOther - Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal  injury,  environmental,  employee  travel,  telephone  and  cellular,  computer  software,  bad  debt,  and  other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million noncash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital  projects,  2020  lease  impairments,  and  higher  equity  income.  Partially  offsetting  these  decreases  were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local  taxes.  Both  periods  in  2021  and  2020  included  a  reduction  of  expense  for  weather  and  wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

Financially, the company has significant exposure through lease obligations, with locomotive leases included in $207 million of interest-bearing lease commitments detailed in purchase obligations. On the balance sheet, locomotives are a major component of equipment assets, valued at $9,371 million in cost and $5,592 million in net book value after depreciation, with an estimated useful life of 17 years.

The  STB continues  its  efforts  to  explore  expanding  rail  regulation  and  is  reviewing  proposed  rulemaking  in  various  areas, including  reciprocal  switching,  commodity  exemptions,  and  expanding  and  easing  procedures  for  smaller  rate complaints.  The  STB  also  continues  to  explore  changes  to  the  methodology  for  determining  railroad  revenue adequacy and the possible uses of revenue adequacy in regulating railroad rates. The STB posts quarterly reports on  rate  reasonableness  cases,  maintains  a  database  on  service  complaints,  and  has  the  authority  to  initiate investigations, among other things.\n\nDOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,  and  DHS,  along  with  other  federal  agencies,  have  jurisdiction  over  certain  aspects  of  safety, movement  of  hazardous  materials  and  hazardous  waste,  emissions  requirements,  and  equipment  standards. Additionally,  various  state  and  local  agencies  have  jurisdiction  over  disposal  of  hazardous  waste  and  seek  to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.",

      "answer": "Emerson's reporting reveals a multi-layered view of the AspenTech relationship: (1) AspenTech's revenue contribution grew from $1M in 2023 to $8M in 2024 (Page 55), indicating early-stage integration success; (2) AspenTech maintains its own stock-based compensation plans with performance stock units tied to metrics like annual contract value and free cash flow, creating ongoing financial obligations for Emerson (Page 70); and (3) The original acquisition structure involved issuing $6B in cash and creating 'New AspenTech' where Emerson owns 55% of the equity, explaining both the strategic partial divestiture and the complex accounting treatment (Page 26). Together, these elements show a deliberate financial engineering approach to maintain strategic influence while enabling AspenTech operational independence.",

      "question": "How does Emerson's acquisition and financial treatment of National Instruments Corporation reflect across its pro forma results, equity investment disclosures, and segment reporting, particularly in terms of the $1,693 million in attributable net sales, the $56 million mark-to-market gain, and the formation of the Test & Measurement segment?",
      "answer": "Emerson's acquisition and financial treatment of National Instruments Corporation (NI) is reflected across three key areas: (1) In the pro forma results, $1,693 million in attributable net sales from NI is included, along with $424 million in ongoing intangibles amortization and other acquisition-related costs. (2) As an equity investment, Emerson reported a $56 million mark-to-market gain on its investment in NI, which was valued at $136 million as of September 30, 2023, before completing the acquisition on October 11, 2023. (3) Following the acquisition, NI was rebranded as Test & Measurement and became a new segment within Emerson\u2019s Software and Control business group, signaling a strategic realignment and integration of NI\u2019s $1.7 billion revenue contribution into Emerson\u2019s operational structure.",

      "question": "How does the financial impact of Emerson's divestiture of its 40% stake in Copeland align with the tax implications and the pretax loss recorded on the note receivable, and what does this reveal about the overall strategic and financial outcome of the transaction?",
      "answer": "Emerson's divestiture of its 40% non-controlling equity stake in Copeland resulted in a $539 pretax gain ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations, as noted in the overview section. However, the company also recorded a $279 pretax loss ($217 after-tax) in continuing operations to adjust the carrying value of its note receivable to reflect the transaction price. Additionally, taxes related to the Copeland transaction amounted to approximately $2.2 billion in 2023, with further tax payments expected in 2025. This combination of a gain on the equity stake sale and a loss on the note receivable adjustment reveals a complex financial outcome, where the strategic divestiture generated significant capital but also required a write-down on associated financing instruments, impacting both current and future tax liabilities.",

      "answer": "The Bomi Group acquisition supports UPS's strategic expansion into healthcare logistics, particularly in enhancing complex cold-chain capabilities both domestically and internationally, as noted in the Supply Chain Solutions section. Operationally, the acquisition added $116 million in compensation costs in 2023 within Supply Chain Solutions, reflecting the integration's labor impact. Financially, the 2023 completion of purchase accounting allocations for Bomi Group indicates the ongoing integration process, with goodwill reported under International Package and Supply Chain Solutions. Together, these elements show that while Bomi Group strengthens UPS's strategic position in healthcare logistics, its integration has introduced measurable labor costs and long-term asset valuation considerations that are still being finalized.",

      "answer": "UPS plans to purchase approximately 3,000 alternative fuel vehicles in 2024, which demonstrates a near-term strategic commitment to transitioning toward sustainable transportation. This aligns with their long-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, which they acknowledge depends on the development and availability of reliable, affordable, and sustainable alternative solutions like alternative fuel vehicles. As of December 31, 2023, UPS already operates more than 17,000 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, indicating existing progress and infrastructure in place to support broader sustainability objectives. However, UPS highlights uncertainty around the pace of technological advancements and cost predictability, which could impact the success of their climate goals despite current commitments.",

      "question": "How does UPS's acquisition of Happy Returns intersect with their strategic growth initiatives in Supply Chain Solutions, and what financial impacts from goodwill accounting and compensation costs are directly tied to this acquisition?",
      "answer": "UPS's acquisition of Happy Returns is explicitly tied to their strategic growth initiatives in Supply Chain Solutions, as noted in the MD&A section (page_25), where it is described as a technology-focused company providing end-to-end return services that support the company's innovation-driven strategy. Financially, the acquisition contributes to the goodwill activity reported in 2023, with Happy Returns being one of the two primary acquisitions (along with MNX Global Logistics) that added to the $4.9 billion consolidated goodwill balance (page_97). Additionally, the acquisition resulted in an incremental $116 million in compensation costs within the Supply Chain Solutions segment, as noted in the Compensation and Benefits section (page_41), reflecting the integration of new employees from the acquired company. These elements together show how the Happy Returns acquisition supports strategic positioning while also introducing measurable financial impacts through goodwill and personnel costs.",

These contracts are subject to FAR and DFARS regulations and are accounted for under a cost-plus reasonable profit margin framework, with revenue recognized continuously over time due to the U.S. government's ownership of work in progress (page_62). However, this reliance on FMS introduces execution risks, as the company is dependent on the DoD's capacity and speed in converting international requests into actual sales, which could adversely impact performance if delays occur (page_16).

Higher interest rates increase the borrowing costs on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investments. Interest rates also impact our pension. For example, higher interest rates generally reduce the measure of our gross pension obligations while lower interest rates increase it.\n\nPublic health. We face a wide variety of risks related to public health crises, epidemics, pandemics or similar events. If a new health epidemic or outbreak were to occur, we could experience broad and varied effects similar to the impact of COVID-19, including adverse impacts to our workforce and supply chain, inflationary pressures and increased costs, schedule or production delays, market volatility and other financial ramifications. If any of these were to occur, our future results and performance could be adversely impacted.\n\n## International sales may pose different economic, regulatory, competition and other risks.\n\nInternational sales present risks that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S. business. In 2024, 26% of our total net sales were associated with international customers. International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, including changes in foreign national priorities, foreign  government  budgets,  global  economic  conditions,  and  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  possibility  of  trade  sanctions  and  other government actions, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. Sales of military products and services and any associated industrial development (offset) agreements are subject to U.S. export regulations and foreign policy, and there could be significant delays or other issues in reaching definitive agreements for announced programs. See the Risk Factor 'G eopolitical, macroeconomic and public health events and conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.' Competition for international sales is intense, including from international  manufacturers  whose  governments  sometimes  provide  research  and  development  assistance,  marketing  subsidies  and  other  assistance  for  their products and services.\n\nOur international business is conducted through FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment and by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. FMS contracts with the U.S. G overnment are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. Because the U.S. G overnment functions as an intermediary in FMS sales, we are reliant on, and could be adversely impacted by, the capacity and speed of the DoD's administration of requests from non-U.S. countries to convert requests to sales. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales directly to international customers and are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including product testing, import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, investments, tax ation, repatriation of earnings, ex change controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative,  civil,  or  criminal  liabilities,  including  suspension,  debarment  from  bidding  for  or  performing  government  contracts,  or  suspension  of  our  ex port privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who also are exposed to similar risks.\n\nWe believe DCS transactions present a higher level of potential risks because they involve direct commercial relationships with parties with which we typically have less familiarity. Additionally, international procurement and local country rules and regulations, contract laws and judicial systems differ from those in the U.S. and,  in  some  cases,  may  be  less  predictable  than  those  in  the  U.S.,  which  could  impair  our  ability  to  enforce  contracts  and  increase  the  risk  of  adverse  or unpredictable outcomes, including the possibility that certain matters that would be considered civil matters in the  U.S. are treated as criminal matters in other countries.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  defense  procurements,  some  international  customers  require  contractors  to  comply  with  industrial  cooperation  regulations,  including entering into industrial participation, industrial development or localization agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements (also known as offset contracts), as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services. These offset agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to perform certain  commitments,  which  may  include  in-country  purchases,  technology  transfers,  local  manufacturing  support,  consulting  support  to  in-country  projects, investments in joint ventures and financial support projects, and preference for local suppliers or subcontractors. The customer's expectations in respect of the scope of offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value content, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may result in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, some of our existing offset agreements are dependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business, which may increase the risk of breaching our obligations, exposing us to compliance risks of the joint venture, and impairing our ability to recover  our  investment.  For  more  information  on  our  industrial  development  obligations,  including  the  notional  value  of  our  remaining  industrial  development obligations  and  potential  penalties  for  non-compliance,  see  'Contractual  Commitments'  in  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations.",

Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to ex ceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\n\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n\nWe evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\n\nWe determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary (e.g., awards, incentive fees and claims), we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the ex tent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt the inception of a contract, we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. G enerally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the ex isting contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. G overnment, including FMS contracts, are subject to the FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\n\nFor non-U.S. government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nWe  recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the  products  and  services.  In  determining  when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. G overnment and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is",

Once the debt ceiling is reached, Treasury may have to use extraordinary measures to prevent default. Treasury's available cash and any extraordinary measures taken should delay the risk of default for at least several months after the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the upcoming months, the new Congress will return to the task of funding the U.S. G overnment for the balance of FY  2025. Significant differences that must be resolved include the different allocations as noted above and policy matters that arose during consideration of the CR and the underlying bills.\n\nWe anticipate the federal budget will continue to be subject to debate and compromise shaped by, among other things, the new Administration and Congress, the global security environment, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic conditions. The result may be shifting funding priorities, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and our programs.\n\n## Geopolitical and E conomic E nvironment\n\nWe operate in a complex and evolving global security environment and our business is affected by geopolitical and security issues. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and heightened tension in the Pacific region have elevated global security concerns resulting in increased interest for our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture. In this context, the U.S. G overnment, our largest customer, continues to align its budget with the defense priorities set forth in the 2022 National Defense Strategy. In addition, security assistance provided by the U.S. G overnment and its allies to Ukraine has increased  U.S.  G overnment and allied demand to replenish  U.S. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential future orders, including for the ramp-up in production capacity for certain products. We continue to expect additional orders over the next several years attributable to the global threat environment. We operate primarily in a long-cycle business and the U.S. G overnment has been focused on increasing industry capacity to meet demand. We continue to work with the U.S. Government and our supply chain to evaluate increases in capacity at our operations to anticipate potential demand and enable us to deliver critical capabilities.\n\nOur  business  and  financial  performance  is  also  affected  by  general  economic  conditions.  We  continue  to  ex perience  supply  chain  challenges,  including supplier shortages and performance issues. These issues have delayed certain customer deliveries, have been a limiting factor on our ability to ramp up production in response to customer demand for certain products and have caused out-of-sequence manufacturing, which increases costs and decreases operational efficiency. In addition, elevated levels of inflation and macroeconomic conditions present risks for us, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. Certain costs, including rising labor rates and supplier costs, have increased as a result of inflation, and have adversely affected our margins on certain programs. In addition, some suppliers are reducing the duration of pricing validity of their proposals to us or seeking to reopen pricing on existing agreements, which is operationally challenging and increases the risk of cost volatility. We continue to work to mitigate challenges caused by the supply chain or current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by supporting small business and at-risk suppliers, deploying resources to work with our supply chain, securing materials and support by executing  long-term  contracts,  enforcing  existing  contract  terms,  identifying  alternative  sources,  collaborating  with  our  customers  to  address  industry-wide challenges, and optimizing our supply chain organization through digital transformation and workforce development. If we experience significant supply chain issues or high rates of inflation, and are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our future profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for ex isting fix ed-price contracts, may be adversely affected.  Inflation and higher interest rates can also constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services potentially impacting future orders, especially in a budget constrained environment. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation.\n\n## International Business\n\nA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is conducted either by FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2024, approximately 73% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 27% were DCS. Additionally, in 2024, substantially all of our sales from international customers were in our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments. Space's sales from international customers were not material in 2024. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.\n\nIn 2024, international customers accounted for 32% of Aeronautics' net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. G overnment and seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. G overnment and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of",

The words 'believe,' 'estimate,' 'anticipate,' 'project,' 'intend,' 'expect,' 'plan,' 'outlook,' 'scheduled,' 'forecast' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties.\n\nStatements and assumptions with respect to future sales, income and cash flows, growth, program performance, the outcome of litigation, anticipated pension costs and funding, environmental remediation cost estimates, planned acquisitions or dispositions of assets, future regulatory, economic or geopolitical changes, or the anticipated consequences thereof are examples of forward-looking statements. Numerous factors, including the risk factors described in the following section, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those ex pressed in our forward-looking statements.\n\nOur actual financial results likely will be different from any projections due to the inherent nature of projections. G iven these uncertainties, forward-looking statements should not be relied on in making investment decisions. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K speak only as of the date of its filing. Except where required by applicable law, we expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-K to reflect subsequent events, changed circumstances, changes in expectations, or the estimates and assumptions associated with them. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protections provided by the federal securities laws.\n\n## ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors\n\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. While we seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. Y ou should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K, before deciding to trade in our common stock or debt securities.\n\n## Risks Related to our Reliance on Government Contracts, our Industry and the E conomy\n\n## We depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. Government for a substantial portion of our business. Changes in the U.S. Government's priorities, or delays or reductions in spending could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe derived 73% of our total consolidated net sales from the U.S. G overnment in 2024, including 65% from the Department of Defense (DoD). We expect to continue to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. G overnment contracts. A reduction in overall U.S. defense spending, on an absolute or inflationadjusted basis, because of shifting priorities, budget compromises or otherwise could adversely affect our business.  Budget uncertainty, the potential for  U.S. Government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt ceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs. If appropriations  are  delayed  or  a  government  shutdown  were  to  occur  and  continue  for  an  ex tended  period,  we  could  be  at  risk  of  reduced  orders,  program cancellations and other disruptions and nonpayment. When the U.S. Government operates under a continuing resolution, new contract and program starts are restricted and funding for our programs may be unavailable, reduced or delayed.\n\nOur contracts with the U.S. G overnment are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY ) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations over time. To the extent we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract or in advance of a contract award or contract definitization, we are at risk of not being reimbursed for those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated under the contract or the contract is successfully awarded, definitized and funded, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFailure to fund or the termination of significant programs or contracts by the U.S. G overnment could adversely affect our business and financial performance. DoD's changes in funding priorities also could reduce opportunities in existing programs and in future programs or initiatives where we intend to compete and where we have made investments. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent on existing programs, we may not be successful and, even if we  are  successful,  the  replacement  programs  may  be  funded  at  lower  levels  or  result  in  lower  margins.  In  addition,  our  ability  to  grow  in  key  areas  such  as hypersonics programs, classified programs and next-generation franchise programs will be affected by the",

(a)\n\nAt December 31, 2024, third-party guarantees totaled $351 million, of which approximately 30% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. G enerally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently  available  information  and  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances. Actual  results  could  differ  from  our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. G overnment and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the  products  and  services.  Substantially  all  of  our  revenue  is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations in which control transfers continuously to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage of completion cost-to-cost measure of progress.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. We also estimate variable",

These pension funding relief provisions are expected to result in decreases to CAS expense, and the related recovery under our contracts, for our U.S. qualified pension plans beginning in 2022, as the interest rates used to determine pension funding requirements for these plans are also used in determining CAS expense.\n\n## Acquisition accounting adjustments\n\nAcquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of  the  property,  plant  and  equipment  fair  value  adjustment  acquired  through  acquisitions  and  the  amortization  of  customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired. These adjustments are not considered part of management's evaluation of segment results.\n\nThe components of Acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows:\n\n",

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\nOn  November  29,  2021,  Honeywell  Quantum  Solutions,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Honeywell,  and  Cambridge  Quantum Computing, a leading developer of quantum computing and quantum software, combined to form Quantinuum. Prior to closing the transaction, Honeywell held a 4.2% ownership interest in Cambridge Quantum Computing. At closing of the business combination, Honeywell contributed an additional $270 million of cash and is the controlling majority-owner of Quantinuum, with an overall 54% ownership  in  the  business.  Quantinuum  is  well  positioned  to  lead  the  quantum  computing  industry  by  offering  advanced,  fully integrated hardware and software solutions at an unprecedented pace, scale and level of performance to large high-growth markets worldwide. Quantinuum supports customer needs for improved computation in cyber security, drug discovery and delivery, material science, finance, and optimization across all major industrial markets. The business is included within Corporate and All Other, which is not considered a reportable business segment. The combination was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting; as such, assets and liabilities of Quantinuum are consolidated by Honeywell and included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon close of the transaction, Honeywell recorded a non-cash adjustment of $460 million in Additional paid-in-capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the contribution of ownership interest in Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing for the formation of Quantinuum. In addition, Honeywell recognized a gain of $22 million related to the fair value remeasurement of Honeywell's existing 4.2% ownership interest in Cambridge Quantum Computing, which was recorded in Other (income) expense on in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Operations.  At  close  of  the  transaction,  the  fair  value  of  Cambridge  Quantum  Computing's noncontrolling interest in Quantinuum was $419 million. In December 2021, Cambridge Quantum Computing contributed cash of $12  million  to  Quantinuum,  increasing  their  noncontrolling  interest  and  decreasing  Honeywell's  additional-paid-in-capital.  As  of December 31, 2021, the assets and liabilities in Honeywell's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $90 million of intangible assets and  $943  million  allocated  to  goodwill,  which  is  non-deductible  for  tax  purposes.  The  purchase  accounting  is  subject  to  final adjustments, primarily for the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the shares outstanding of Sparta Systems, a leading provider of enterprise quality management software for the life sciences industry, for $1,303 million. Sparta Systems is expected to further strengthen the Company's leadership in industrial automation, digital transformation solutions, and enterprise performance management software. The  business  is  included  within  the  Performance  Materials  and  Technologies  segment.  The  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  with Sparta  Systems  are  included  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  as  of  December  31,  2021,  including  $383  million  of  intangible assets and $1,011 million allocated to goodwill, which is nondeductible for tax purposes. The purchase accounting is subject to final adjustment,  primarily  for  the  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  amounts  allocated  to  goodwill,  tax  balances,  and  certain  preacquisition contingencies.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Company  acquired  businesses  for  an  aggregate  cost  (net  of  cash  and  debt  assumed)  of  $261  million,  which included the October 2020 acquisition of Rocky Research and the December 2020 acquisition of Sine Group. Rocky Research is a technology leader specializing in thermal, energy and power management solutions and is included within the Aerospace segment. Sine Group offers a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that handles visitor management, workplace and supply chain solutions and is included  in  the  Honeywell  Building  Technologies  segment.  The  acquisition  of  Rocky  Research  and  Sine  Group  included approximately $167 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.\n\nDuring 2019, there were no significant acquisitions that closed individually or in the aggregate.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nOn March 15, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its retail footwear business in exchange for gross cash consideration of $230 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $95 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which was recorded in Other (income) expense. The retail footwear business was previously included in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2019, there were no significant divestitures that closed individually or in the aggregate.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.\n\n63",

In 2021, gross margin improved due to favorable pricing, higher productivity, and increased demand, despite higher direct and indirect material costs of approximately $1,350 million. Favorable pricing also supported segment profit growth alongside higher productivity and higher sales volumes of higher-margin products, even as overall sales volumes declined.

      "question": "How does Honeywell's valuation methodology for its investment in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock reconcile with the partial redemption terms agreed upon during Garrett's bankruptcy reorganization and the subsequent redemption payments made in late 2021?",
      "answer": "Honeywell initially valued the Series B Preferred Stock at fair value based on the present value of mandatory redemptions discounted at 7.25% (page 103), aligning with the terms outlined in the Certificate of Designation, which included mandatory redemptions starting at $35 million in 2022 and $100 million annually through 2030 unless EBITDA or liquidity conditions prevented it (page 102). Following Garrett's bankruptcy emergence, the Series B Preferred Stock Certificate was amended twice, accelerating partial redemptions: the First Partial Redemption of $211 million occurred on December 28, 2021, and the Second Partial Redemption of $200 million was planned for Q1 2022 (page 103). These redemptions reduced the present value of future cash flows and thus impacted the fair value of the remaining investment, which Honeywell adjusted accordingly, recording $423 million in long-term investments as of December 31, 2021 (page 103). The valuation methodology reflects both the contractual redemption schedule and the actual redemption events, which altered the expected cash flows from the Series B Preferred Stock.",

An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, the  Company filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On December 7, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement (Settlement Agreement) and Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, which includes payment by Honeywell of $10 million to settle the claims in dispute. Honeywell continues to believe the claims lack merit and denies wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. The Settlement Agreement remains subject to final court approval and other conditions.\n\n## GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable.\n\nOn September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates  filed  voluntary  petitions  for  relief  under  Chapter  11  of  the  United  States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31,  2020,  the  Company  reviewed  the  aggregate  carrying  value  of  the  receivable  amounts  due  in  connection  with  the  Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements.\n\nOn April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett's amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on  April  30,  2021  (the  Effective  Date),  Garrett  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  On  the  Effective  Date,  and  in  accordance  with  the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending  legal  actions  related  to  the  Garrett  Indemnity  and  Tax  Matters  Agreement,  and  (iv)  all  pending  litigation  between  the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved.\n\nThe original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provides for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $35 million in 2022  and  $100  million  per  year  from  2023  to  2030  (inclusive)  at  the  anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  unless  (i)  Garrett's consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year is less than $425 million, or (ii) Garrett does not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due will accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also includes rights which allow (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions are met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions are met.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial  redemption.  The  First  Partial  Redemption  would  be  applied  to  the  latest  scheduled  redemption  dates,  beginning  with  the shares  to  be  redeemed  in  2030.  The Amendment  also  provides  that  the  Company  cannot  exercise  its  right  to  put  the  Series  B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption does not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation.\n\nOn December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerates the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allows Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before  March  31,  2022,  such  that  the  present  value  of  remaining  outstanding  shares  of  the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  will  be $207  million  (Second  Partial  Redemption).  The  Second  Partial  Redemption  is  subject  to  similar  terms  as  the  First  Partial Redemption, including that Garrett has funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption is also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nOn December 17, 2021, Garrett  announced  their  intention  to  effect  the  First  Partial  Redemption  on  December  28,  2021,  in  the amount  of  $211  million,  and  plan  to  effect  the  Second  Partial  Redemption  during  the  first  quarter  of  2022  for  a  corresponding payment of $200 million. On December 28, 2021, Garrett paid $211 million for the amount due as the First Partial Redemption.\n\nThe Company recorded the Series B Preferred Stock at fair value at the Effective Date. The Company believes the present value of the mandatory redemptions is an appropriate basis for determining the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company's present value reflects amortized cost determined by the present value of the mandatory redemptions discounted at 7.25%, which is the rate reflected in the Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. The discount amount will accrete into interest income over the mandatory redemption period. In addition to the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company subscribed for 4.2 million shares of Garrett's Series A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into Garrett's Common Stock if certain conditions are met. Prior to and following  Garrett's  emergence  from  bankruptcy,  the  Company  also  held  2.9  million  shares  of  Garrett's  Common  Stock.  As  of December 31, 2021, Short-term investments included $34 million and Investments and long-term receivables included $423 million for the Company's investments in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\nThe Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters (including the matter described below). The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters,  as  well  as  potential  ranges  of  possible  losses  (taking  into  consideration  any  insurance  recoveries),  based  on  a  careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.\n\nSuch matters include:\n\n- Petrobras and Unaoil - The Company continues to cooperate with investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  and  the  Brazilian  authorities  relating  to  the  Company's  use  of  third  parties  who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) in connection with a  project  awarded  in  2010.  The  investigations  focus  on  compliance  with  the  U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  similar Brazilian laws (the UOP Matters), and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary's prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011. The Company continues to be engaged in discussions with the authorities with respect to a potential comprehensive resolution of these matters.\n\nAs the discussions are both ongoing and at different stages with regards to each respective authority, there can be no assurance as  to  whether  the  Company  will  reach  a  resolution  with  such  authorities  or  as  to  the  potential  timing,  terms,  or  collateral consequences of any such resolution. As a result, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these UOP Matters or the potential impact on the Company. Based on available information to date, the Company estimates that a potential comprehensive resolution of these UOP Matters would result in a probable loss of at least $160 million, and the Company has recorded a charge in this amount in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, and accrued a corresponding liability on the Consolidated Balance  Sheet. Amounts  payable  to  authorities  pursuant  to  any  potential  final  comprehensive  resolution  could  differ  from  the amount recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on available information to date, the Company does not expect that any such difference would be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position.\n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably  possible  losses  (or  a  range  of  possible  losses)  in  excess  of  current  accruals  for  such  matters.  Considering  the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.\n\n98 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "answer": "Honeywell's $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement, entered into on March 31, 2021, and amended on November 18, 2021, was maintained for general corporate purposes and replaced the prior agreement dated April 10, 2020, which was terminated on March 31, 2021. Despite having access to this facility and the ability to borrow short-term at favorable rates (e.g., 0.07% weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2021), the company did not draw any amounts under the agreement during the year. This aligns with its broader liquidity strategy that also included issuing $2.5 billion in Senior Notes in August 2021, which were used to redeem $2.5 billion of callable 2022 notes. Additionally, the 364-Day Credit Agreement was part of a coordinated refinancing effort that included an amended $4.0 billion 5-Year Credit Agreement, and both agreements were amended to transition from LIBOR-based rates to alternative benchmarks, reflecting a proactive approach to managing interest rate risk and maintaining flexibility in capital markets.",

The  Company  may  redeem  the  Notes  at  any  time,  and  from  time  to  time,  in  whole  or  in  part,  at  the Company's option at the applicable make-whole redemption price. The Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and rank equally with each other and with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of the Company's subordinated debt. The offering provided gross proceeds of $2.5 billion, offset by $18.0 million in discount and  closing  costs  related  to  the  offering.  The  Company  used  the  proceeds  of  the  offering  to  redeem  at  par  $2  billion  of  the $2.5  billion  in  outstanding  principal  amount  of  the  callable  0.483%  Senior  Notes  due  2022  and  to  redeem  in  full  and  at  par $500 million callable Floating rate Senior Notes due 2022 that the Company issued in August 2020.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company entered into a $4.0 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement) and a $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement). The 5-Year Credit Agreement amended and  restated  the  previously  reported  $4.0  billion  amended  and  restated  five-year  credit  agreement  dated  as  of  April  26,  2019. Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement dated as of April 10, 2020, which was terminated in accordance with its terms effective March 31, 2021. Amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 30, 2022, unless (i) Honeywell elects to convert all then outstanding amounts into a term loan, upon which such amounts shall be repaid in full on March 30, 2023, or (ii) the 364-Day Credit Agreement  is  terminated  earlier  pursuant  to  its  terms.  The  5-Year  Credit  Agreement  and  the  364-Day  Credit  Agreement  are maintained for general corporate purposes. On November 18, 2021, the Company amended the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the 5-Year Credit Agreement to transition from LIBOR-based benchmark rates to the appropriate replacement rates.\n\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company repaid its 4.25% notes due 2021.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement or 5-Year Credit Agreement.\n\nOn August 19, 2020, the Company issued $2.5 billion 0.483% Senior Notes due 2022 and $500 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2022 (collectively, the 2022 Callable Notes). The $500 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2022 were issued at a variable interest rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus the applicable margin of 0.23%. The Company may redeem the 2022 fixed rate notes at any time, in whole or in part, at the Company's option. The Company may redeem the 2022 floating rate notes at any time, in  whole  or  in  part,  on  or  after  August  19,  2021.  The  2022  Callable  Notes  resulted  in  gross  proceeds  of  $3.0  billion,  offset  by $10 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering. The Company used the proceeds of the offering to repay $3.0 billion of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement (defined below).\n\nOn May 18, 2020, the Company issued $1.25 billion 1.35% Senior Notes due 2025, $1.0 billion 1.95% Senior Notes due 2030, and $750 million 2.80% Senior Notes due 2050 (collectively, the 2020 Notes) to replace and, accordingly, permanently reduce $3.0 billion of undrawn commitments under the Term Loan Agreement, referenced below. The Company may redeem the 2020 Notes at any time,  in  whole  or  in  part,  at  the  Company's  option.  The  offering  provided  gross  proceeds  of  $3.0  billion,  offset  by  $27  million  in discount and closing costs related to the offering.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, the Company issued \u20ac500 million 0.00% Senior Notes due 2024 and \u20ac500 million 0.75% Senior Notes due 2032 (collectively, the 2020 Euro Notes). The offering provided gross proceeds of $1.1 billion, offset by $9 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering.\n\nThe 2022 Callable Notes, 2020 Notes, and 2020 Euro Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and rank equally with each other and with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of the Company's subordinated debt.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "answer": "Honeywell's 2016 Stock Incentive Plan reflects a structured equity compensation strategy with 27.1 million shares available for future grants as of December 31, 2024, indicating continued use of equity incentives. The plan's valuation methodology, using the Black-Scholes model with Monte Carlo simulations for expected term estimation, ensures accurate expense recognition aligned with market conditions and employee behavior. Additionally, the plan's flexibility is evident through multiple amendments and the inclusion of various award forms such as Restricted Stock Units, Stock Option Agreements, and Performance Plan Grants, which allow tailored compensation arrangements for different employee groups and strategic objectives.",

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nThe 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its A ffiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the A nnual M eeting of Shareowners effective on A pril 25, 2016. A s of December 31, 2024, there were 27.1 million and 0.8 million shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively.\n\n## STOCK OPTIONS\n\nThe exercise price, term, and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the Company's stock plans are generally determined by the M anagement Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of the Company's stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after 10 years.\n\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company used a M onte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n\nThe following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations from stock options:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Honeywell's use of the cost-to-cost input method for long-term contracts reflect both the complexity of management's judgment in estimating contract costs and the auditor's evaluation of internal controls, and how does this align with the financial statement disclosures regarding deferred costs and revenue recognition timing?",
      "answer": "Honeywell's use of the cost-to-cost input method for long-term contracts requires significant management judgment in estimating total contract costs, influenced by factors such as inflationary trends, technical and schedule risks, and labor agreements (page 44). This judgment directly affects the timing and amount of revenue recognized, which is further complicated by the need to account for variable consideration and deferred costs. The auditor evaluated the internal controls over these estimates and the consistency of the method's application, particularly due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in long-term contract accounting (page 117). Financial statement disclosures indicate that deferred contract fulfillment costs were $1,156 million as of December 31, 2024, showing the material impact of these long-term contracts on the balance sheet and reinforcing the need for robust controls and accurate estimation (page 63). Together, these perspectives highlight the interplay between accounting policy, financial reporting risk, and the need for rigorous audit scrutiny.",

A lso, projections of any evaluation of effectiv eness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers - Long-Term Contracts - Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company has several businesses which enter into long-term contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term ('over time') as the work progresses and control of the goods and services are continuously transferred to the customer. Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost input method.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts requires management's judgment in estimating total contract costs. Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements.\n\nGiven the significance of the judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts (which varies upon the length of the contract), auditing long-term contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to long-term contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management's assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method.\n- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time.\n- We tested recorded revenue using a combination of analytical procedures and detailed contract testing.\n\n## /S/ DE LOITTE  &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 14, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\n\n115 Honeywell International Inc.",

          "chunk_text": "## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. M any estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. We consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. A ctual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts -We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risks, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage of completion. A nticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing, and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.\n\nIncome Taxes -On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes, and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiativ es. O ur projections of future tax able income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. W e assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.\n\nSee Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of additional income tax policies.\n\n42 Honeywell International Inc.",

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\n## SALES RECOGNITION\n\nProduct and service sales are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance, and engineering activities, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. The Company recognizes revenue over time as the Company performs on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost input method of progress for contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The Company reviews its cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risks, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required.\n\nThe customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of the Company's products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. A dditionally , expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and  costs  result  in  recognition  of  deferred  costs  (asset)  and  deferred  revenue  (liability)  within  Other  assets  and  A ccrued  liabilities,  respectiv ely ,  in  the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred contract fulfillment costs were $1,156 million and $1,193 million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively . The amounts recognized as Cost of products and services sold were $188 million, $148 million, and $154 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\nRevenues for the Company's mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method.\n\nThe terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits.  The  Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount the  Company will receive from customers.  The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\n\n## STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nThe principal awards issued under the Company's stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 15 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards expected to vest and are based on the Company's historical forfeiture rates.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully  supportable, certain positions remain that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority . In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of the Company's provision for income taxes. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision, the current tax liability , and deferred tax es in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. See Note 5 Income Taxes for additional information.\n\n61 Honeywell International Inc.",

These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring, or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints. On October 8, 2024, we announced our intention to spin off the A dvanced M aterials business into an independent, U.S. publicly traded company , which is targeted to be completed by the end of 2025 or early 2026.

          "chunk_text": "## Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are on a journey to execute our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy within our Better not Bigger framework. We are focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, growing operating profit and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion. The Customer First component of our strategy focuses on, among other things, enhancing the capabilities that we believe our customers value the most: speed and ease of access to our services. The People Led component of our strategy aims to enhance the employee value proposition. Our Innovation Driven strategic approach utilizes technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network and to enhance the customer experience.\n\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. For the year, we increased average daily volume, revenue per piece and operating margin within global small package operations, with growth led by smalland medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") as we executed on our strategy. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to have, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our business. We experienced a year-over-year increase in commercial volume as business returned to pre-pandemic levels, while business-to-consumer volume declined, partly due to the surge in e-commerce at the onset of the pandemic. In the second half of the year, COVID-19 resulted in a reduction in the number of flights we operated in Asia relative to our expectations, which contributed to an overall decline in international volume in the fourth quarter. Within Supply Chain Solutions, operating margin increased with demand for our services particularly strong in Forwarding and healthcare logistics, including COVID-19 relief efforts.\n\nThe overall economic environment continues to be challenging. Global supply chain disruption continues, and resulted in capacity constraints that drove higher transportation costs, particularly in our Supply Chain Solutions businesses. Rising inflation and labor market challenges continue to cause wage pressures in certain markets. We continue to monitor the impacts of these external conditions on our business; however, we anticipate that demand for our services will remain strong.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, following enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act (\"ARPA\"), we remeasured the UPS/IBT Full Time Employee Pension Plan. This resulted in a $3.3 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gain in the first quarter. We completed the divestiture of UPS Freight on April 30, 2021, and used the cash proceeds of $848 million to reduce outstanding indebtedness. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $46 million for the year in respect of this transaction. The divestiture triggered a remeasurement of certain of our U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, which had only an immaterial impact on results of operations for the year. For additional information on this divestiture, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. Following the divestiture, we renamed our Supply Chain &amp; Freight businesses Supply Chain Solutions.\n\nIn October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform focused on same-day delivery services, for $586 million. The results of Roadie are reported within Supply Chain Solutions. The acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year.

      "answer": "UPS disclosed a $2.3 billion pre-tax actuarial loss in 2020 related to potential coordinating benefits owed to the Central States Pension Fund, driven by updated estimates of future payments. This liability is sensitive to discount rate assumptions, as a 25 basis point change in the expected return on assets could significantly alter the valuation. Additionally, UPS's capital investment planning must account for these pension obligations, as the company notes that unexpected increases in benefit contributions could constrain its ability to invest in aircraft, technology, and infrastructure, which represent major components of its $33.5 billion in net fixed assets. Thus, UPS faces a dual challenge: managing a pension liability that fluctuates with financial market assumptions while ensuring adequate capital deployment to sustain its asset-intensive logistics operations.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates of the expected useful lives and residual values.

This situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft, resulting in an impairment charge or a reduction of the expected useful life of an aircraft that may result in increased depreciation expense. Revisions to estimates of useful lives and residual values could also be caused by changes to our maintenance programs, governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust them as necessary. Adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.\n\nWe monitor our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment which may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. If circumstances are present that indicate the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we then perform impairment testing at the asset group level.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our business requires significant capital and other investments; if we do not accurately forecast our future investment needs, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur business requires significant capital investments, including in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sortation and other equipment. In addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements, we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions, and consistent with our long-term strategy and commitments. These investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth. Forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty, such as general economic trends, changes in governmental regulation and competition. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability.\n\n## Employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us; further cost increases could materially adversely affect us.\n\nOur employee health, retiree health and pension benefit expenses are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs, in particular, ongoing increases in healthcare costs in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our company-sponsored defined benefit plan obligations. Increasing healthcare costs, volatility in investment returns and discount rates, as well as changes in laws, regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and have required, and may in the future require significant contributions to our benefit plans. Our national master agreement with the Teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain healthcare expenses, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that these efforts will not materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe participate in various trustee-managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. As part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period. The multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants. Future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined through collective bargaining. However, in future collective bargaining negotiations, we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to one or more of these plans. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans.\n\nIn addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations, we may have an obligation in the future to pay significant coordinating benefits previously earned by UPS employees in the Central States Pension Fund (the \"CSPF\"). For additional information on our potential liabilities related to the CSPF, see note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Insurance and claims expense could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe have a combination of both self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations, including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, aircraft and related liabilities, business interruption and workers' compensation. Self-insured workers' compensation, automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, on an undiscounted basis. Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk continues to increase, which has occurred in recent periods, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we lose our ability to self-insure these risks, our insurance cost could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage.\n\n## Changes in markets and our business plans have resulted, and may in the future result, in substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our assets, thereby reducing our net income.\n\nOur regular review of the carrying value of our assets, changes in business strategy, government regulations, including related to climate change, and economic or market conditions have resulted from time to time, and may in the future result, in substantial impairments of our intangible, fixed or other assets. In addition, we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated. Such changes have in the past, and may in the future, reduce our net income.",

      "question": "Given that Emerson excluded Aspen Technology's internal controls from its assessment, while also relying on third-party valuations with significant assumptions to determine the fair value of acquired intangible assets from the acquisition, how does this exclusion and reliance affect the overall reliability of Emerson's financial reporting for the year ended September 30, 2022?",
      "answer": "Emerson's exclusion of Aspen Technology, Inc.'s internal controls\u2014representing 36% of total assets and 2% of total revenues\u2014from its internal control assessment creates a material gap in the evaluation of financial reporting controls for a significant portion of the company. At the same time, the valuation of intangible assets from the Aspen acquisition relied on third-party specialists and involved significant assumptions, such as projected revenues for customer relationships and obsolescence rates for developed technology. These assumptions, while deemed reasonable, introduce estimation risk into the financial statements. Since internal controls over financial reporting were not evaluated for Aspen, there is no assurance that the assumptions or data used in the third-party valuation were subject to adequate controls, potentially increasing the risk of material misstatement in the valuation of intangibles and related disclosures. Therefore, the combination of the control gap and the estimation risk in valuing Aspen's intangibles introduces a potential weakness in the overall reliability of Emerson\u2019s financial reporting for the year.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nThe Company acquired Aspen Technology, Inc. during 2022, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, Aspen Technology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting representing 36 percent of total assets and 2 percent of total revenues included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Aspen Technology, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management believes that the financial statements for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022 have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates where necessary to reflect the expected effects of events and transactions that have not been completed. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures ensure that material information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management and reported within the required time periods.\n\nIn meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements, management relies on a system of internal accounting controls. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Although the design of this system recognizes that errors or irregularities may occur, management believes that the Company's internal accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee meets with management and the Company's internal auditors periodically to review the work of each and to monitor the discharge by each of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors, who have free access to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, to discuss the quality and acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and internal controls, as well as nonaudit-related services.\n\nThe independent auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Their opinions are based on procedures that they believe to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors and that the Company's internal controls are effective.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\n\nThe Company acquired a controlling interest in Aspen Technology, Inc. during fiscal 2022, and management has excluded this business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. Total assets and revenues of this business excluded from the assessment represented approximately 36 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of the Company's related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n\nThe Company's auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n/s/ S.

The Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements. Based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates, a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material. Sensitivity analysis has limitations; for example, a weaker U.S. dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non-U.S. operating results, and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales. See Notes 1, and 9 through 11.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nPreparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of software and post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services.\n\nIn some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.\n\n## VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION\n\nAssets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, including intangible assets, are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. In fiscal 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Aspen Technology, Inc. and engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of intangible assets. This included the use of certain assumptions and estimates, including the projected revenue for the customer relationship and developed technology intangible asset and the obsolescence rate for the developed technology intangible asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate, they require judgement and are based on experience and historical information obtained from Aspen Technology, Inc.",

      "question": "How did the acquisition of Heritage AspenTech impact Emerson's financial structure, segment performance, and pro forma earnings outlook in fiscal 2022?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of Heritage AspenTech significantly influenced Emerson\u2019s financial structure, segment performance, and pro forma earnings outlook. From a segment performance perspective (page 32), AspenTech sales increased by $337 million (106%) to $656 million in 2022 due to the acquisition, although earnings were only $12 million, reflecting a margin of 1.9% after accounting for $148 million in intangibles amortization. Financially (page 35), Emerson issued $3 billion in long-term debt and increased commercial paper borrowings by $1.3 billion to fund the $6 billion contribution to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, which led to a higher debt-to-capital ratio and increased interest expense. On a pro forma basis (page 57), had the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2020, the combined entity would have reflected $356 million in Heritage AspenTech sales in 2022, though the impact on GAAP net earnings was not material. Together, these perspectives show a strategic but financially intensive acquisition that boosted top-line growth in software but introduced margin pressure and increased leverage.",

          "chunk_text": "\nTotal debt, which includes long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, was $10,374, $6,665 and $7,486 as of September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increased debt was due to the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt and increased commercial paper borrowings of approximately $1.3 billion compared to September 30, 2021. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and the increased commercial paper borrowings to fund the majority of its contribution of approximately $6.0 billion to existing stockholders of Heritage AspenTech as part of the transaction. Long-term debt was issued in December 2021 as follows: $1 billion of 2.0% notes due December 2028, $1 billion of 2.2% notes due December 2031, and $1 billion of 2.8% notes due December 2051. Additionally, the Company repaid $500 of 2.625% notes that matured. See Note 4 and Note 11.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company repaid $300 of 4.25% notes that matured and in fiscal 2020 repaid $500 of 4.875% notes that matured. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, the Company issued $500 of 1.8% notes due October 2027, $500 of 1.95% notes due October 2030 and $500 of 2.75% notes due October 2050, and in September 2020, the Company issued $750 of 0.875% notes due October 2026. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. A portion of the proceeds from the notes issued in September 2020 were also used to fund the acquisition of OSI, which closed on October 1, 2020.\n\nThe total debt-to-total capital ratio and net debt-to-net capital ratio (less cash and short-term investments) increased in 2022 due to the increased borrowings to support the AspenTech transaction discussed above, while it decreased in 2021 due to lower long-term debt and higher equity compared to the prior year. The interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings before income taxes plus interest expense, divided by interest expense. The increase in 2022 reflects higher pretax earnings in the current year, which included the Vertiv subordinated interest gain of $453, the gain on the Therm-O-Disc divestiture of $486, and the Russia business exit loss of $181. Excluding these items, the interest coverage ratio was 15.6, reflecting higher interest expense due to the increased long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings to fund the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. The increase in 2021 reflects higher earnings and slightly lower interest expense.\n\nIn May 2018, the Company entered into a $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced the April 2014 $3.5 billion facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowings. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate alternatives at the Company's option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial. The Company expects to be able to renew its revolving backup credit facility in fiscal 2023 on substantially the same terms as the current facility. The Company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.\n\nEmerson's financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth. At September 30, 2022, the majority of the Company's cash was held outside of the U.S. (primarily in Europe and Asia). The Company routinely repatriates a portion of its non-U.S. cash from earnings each",

      "answer": "Caterpillar estimates its $1,894 million product warranty liability by applying historical claim rates to the current field population and dealer inventory, with rates tailored by machine model, engine size, and geographic location (inside or outside North America). Internally, these historical claim rates are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience, ensuring that the estimates remain aligned with real-world performance. The audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers highlighted the critical nature of this liability due to the significant judgment involved, and auditors tested the completeness and accuracy of the data, developed independent actuarial estimates, and evaluated Caterpillar's methodologies and assumptions. This external validation underscores the importance of consistent and accurate historical claim rate data, especially given the regional variations in warranty claims, which directly influence the reliability of the liability estimate.

      "question": "How does Cat Financial's treatment of credit risk in EAME, particularly in terms of finance receivable modifications and delinquency performance, compare with its overall delinquency trends and historical write-down activity in that region?",
      "answer": "Cat Financial reported $4 million in delinquent finance receivables in EAME as of December 31, 2023, with $2 million 31-60 days past due, $1 million 61-90 days past due, and $1 million 91+ days past due. This follows modifications in the Customer portfolio segment totaling $47 million during the year, which included term extensions adding a weighted average of 15 months and payment deferrals averaging 7 months. Historically, EAME's delinquency levels have fluctuated, with $6 million in 91+ days past due receivables as of December 31, 2022, indicating some improvement in long-term delinquencies but continued need for financial modifications. Additionally, EAME accounted for $1 million in write-downs for the year ended December 31, 2023, showing a relatively low but persistent credit risk exposure in the region.",

      "question": "How does the allocation of 'Cash, Short-Term Instruments and Other' differ across U.S. pension, non-U.S. pension, and other postretirement benefit assets, and what might this indicate about the strategic liquidity positioning for each category?",
      "answer": "The allocation of 'Cash, Short-Term Instruments and Other' varies significantly across the categories: it is $566 million for U.S. pension assets in 2020, $347 million for non-U.S. pension assets in 2020, and $64 million for other postretirement benefit assets in 2021. This suggests a more conservative liquidity strategy for U.S. pension assets compared to non-U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit assets, where smaller cash allocations may reflect differing regulatory, market, or strategic requirements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(page_113) \u2192 Cash, Short-Term Instruments and Other: In the U.S. pension section, 'Cash, short-term instruments and other' is reported at $566 million for 2020, indicating a significant liquidity buffer within U.S. pension assets.",
        "Hop 2: CAT(page_115) \u2192 Cash, Short-Term Instruments and Other: In the other postretirement benefits section, the allocation to 'Cash, short-term instruments and other' is much smaller at $64 million for 2021, suggesting a more limited liquidity focus for this category.",
        "Hop 3: CAT(page_114) \u2192 Cash, Short-Term Instruments and Other: For non-U.S. pension assets in 2020, 'Cash, short-term instruments and other' is $347 million, which is lower than the U.S. pension allocation but higher than the other postretirement category, indicating a moderate liquidity stance for non-U.S. pensions."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Position - Caterpillar SARL IRS Examination\n\nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, as a result of the audits of the Company's U.S. 2007 to 2012 income tax returns, including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') has proposed to tax in the U.S. profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL ('CSARL'). This proposal is based on the IRS examination team's application of the 'substance-over-form' or 'assignment-of-income' judicial doctrines. As described by management, the Company is vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion, as management believes that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. As disclosed by management, the purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the U.S. have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved. Management has concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit. As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in the Company's unrecognized tax benefits. The Company has filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the uncertain tax position arising from the CSARL IRS Examination is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in evaluating the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to the position; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating whether the position was more likely than not to be sustained; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the uncertain tax position arising from the CSARL IRS Examination. These procedures also included, among others (i) evaluating management's process for determining the reasonableness of the uncertain tax position, including reading certain intercompany and third-party agreements which are relevant to evaluating the legal form and substance of the CSARL transaction flows; (ii) evaluating management's assessment of whether the position was more likely than not to produce a tax benefit and the determination by management of the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position; and (iii) evaluating the Revenue Agent Reports ('RARs') from the IRS and management's protests of the RARs. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the applicable tax laws and judicial doctrines related to this matter as well as changes in relevant tax regulations, rulings, and case law.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chicago, Illinois February 16, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1925.",

We  recognized  a  net provision for interest and penalties of $54 million, $38 million and $43 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product  to  a  targeted  end  user.  The  amount  of  accrued  post-sale  discounts  was  $1.4  billion  at  both  December  31,  2021  and 2020.  The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. We adjust the reserve if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material.\n\nAllowance for credit losses -The allowance for credit losses is management's estimate of expected losses over the life of our finance  receivable  portfolio  calculated  using  loss  forecast  models  that  take  into  consideration  historical  credit  loss  experience, current economic conditions and forecasts and scenarios that capture country and industry-specific economic factors. In addition, we consider qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models, including borrower-specific and companyspecific factors. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.\n\nWe measure the allowance for credit losses on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we determine that similar risk characteristics do not exist. We identify finance receivables for individual evaluation based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit  ratings,  as  well  as  general  information  regarding  industry  trends  and  the  economic  environment  in  which  our  customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated is based on the present value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  discounted  at  the  receivables'  effective  interest  rate,  the  fair  value  of  the  collateral  for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable.  In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees.\n\nWhile management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses.\n\nIncome taxes - We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation.  In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.  Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law.  Future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received.\n\nDespite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge  certain  positions.  Settlement  of  any  challenge  can  result  in  no  change,  a  complete  disallowance,  or  some  partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management's evaluation of the information available at the reporting date.  To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits.  The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized  tax  benefits  may  be  necessary  to  reflect  actual  taxes  payable  upon  settlement.   Adjustments  related  to  positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes.  Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities. For tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), based on  the  IRS  examination  team's  application  of  'substance-over-form'  or  'assignment-of-income'  judicial  doctrines.  CSARL  is primarily taxable locally in Switzerland.  We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines.  The  purchase  of  parts  by  CSARL  from  unrelated  parties  and  the  subsequent  sale  of  those  parts  to  unrelated  dealers outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved.   Therefore, we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit.   As  a  result,  no  amount  related  to  these  IRS  adjustments  is  reflected  in  unrecognized  tax  benefits.  We  have  filed  U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012.

      "answer": "General Dynamics reports retirement annuity contracts as part of its pension plan assets with a fair value of $25 million as of December 31, 2023 (page 94). These contracts are classified under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, indicating that their valuation involves significant unobservable inputs (page 93). Over time, the value of these contracts has seen minor fluctuations, increasing from $23 million in 2022 to $25 million in 2023, but showing a slight decrease to $22 million in 2024, with minimal realized or unrealized gains or losses (page 96).

This aligns with the broader company performance, where Gulfstream contributed to a total backlog of $90.6 billion and revenue of $47.7 billion, reflecting a 12.9% increase from 2023. The production ramp-up, particularly for the new G700 model which began deliveries in Q2 2024, was supported by rising inventories and increased customer deposits, indicating sustained demand and future revenue visibility.",

T ypically , revenue is recognized over tim e using costs incurred to date relative to total estim ated costs at completion to m easure progress toward satisfying our perform ance obligations. Incurred costs represent work perform ed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the custom er. Contract costs include labor, m aterial, overhead and, when appropriate, G&amp;A expenses. V ariances in costs recognized from  period to period reflect prim arily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a m easure of progress, year-over-year variances in costs result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volum e.\n\nOperating earnings and m argin in the defense segm ents are driven by changes in volum e, perform ance or contract m ix. Perform ance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustm ents to estim ates at com pletion on individual contracts. These adjustm ents result from  increases or decreases to  the  esti m ated  val ue  of   the  contract,  the  esti m ated  costs  to  com pl ete  the  contract  or  both.  Therefore,  changes  i n  costs  i ncurred  i n  the  peri od compared with prior periods do not necessarily im pact profitability . It is only when total estim ated costs at com pletion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the profitability of that contract m ay be im pacted. Contract m ix refers to changes in the volum e of higher- versus lower-m argin work. Higher or lower m argins can result from  a num ber of factors, including contract type (e.g., fi xed-pri ce/cost-reim bursable) and type of work (e.g., developm ent/production). Contract m ix can also refer to the stage of program  m aturity for our long-term  production contracts. New long-term  production contracts typically have lower m argins initially , and then m argins generally increase as we achieve learning curve im provem ents or realize other cost reductions.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW\n\n## 2024 IN REVIEW\n\n- Strong operating perform ance:\n- Revenue of $47.7 billion, an increase of 12.9% from  2023\n- Operating earnings of $4.8 billion, an increase of 13% from  2023, with sequential growth throughout the year\n- Diluted earnings per share of $13.63, up 13.4% from  2023\n- Cash provided by operating activities of $4.1 billion, or 109% of net earnings\n- Backlog of $90.6 billion, supporting our long-term  growth expectations:\n- Strong Gulfstream  aircraft order activity, including orders across all aircraft m odels\n- Several significant contract awards received in our defense segm ents, including $3.7 billion of com bined awards from  the U.S. Navy for advance procurement and other work for the Virginia-class subm arine program",

      "question": "How does Gulfstream's investment in new business jet aircraft development, such as the G700 entering service in March 2024, align with its inventory valuation practices and the financial risk implications of its U.S. commercial revenue mix, which included $6.7 billion in business jet and related services sales in 2024?",
      "answer": "Gulfstream's strategy of investing in new aircraft development, exemplified by the recent introduction of the G700 in March 2024, reflects a commitment to innovation and maintaining a competitive edge in the business jet market. This approach directly influences inventory practices, as the company manages a significant portion of its inventories\u2014largely for business jet aircraft\u2014using production lot-based average unit costs and recording pre-owned aircraft at the lower of trade-in value or net realizable value. Given that business jet aircraft and related services accounted for $6.7 billion (14% of consolidated revenue) in U.S. commercial sales in 2024, and considering that 51% of U.S. government contracts (which may include defense-related aircraft sales) are fixed-price contracts, the financial risk from cost overruns or inventory write-downs could be significant. This suggests that Gulfstream must carefully balance its innovation-driven growth with inventory management and contract risk mitigation strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Dollars in millions, ex cept share and per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\n\n## A. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nGeneral  Dynamics is  a  global  aerospace  and  defense  com pany  that  offers  a  broad  portfolio  of  products  and  services  in  business  aviation;  ship construction and repair; land com bat vehicles, weapons system s and m unitions; and technology products and services.\n\nThe  following  is  a  discussion  of  certain  significant  accounting  policies,  and  further  discussion  is  contained  in  other  notes  to  these  financial statements.\n\nBasis of Consolidation and Classification. The Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of General Dynam ics Corporation and our  wholly  owned  and  m ajority-owned  subsidiaries.  W e  elim inate  all  intercom pany  balances  and  transactions  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term  contracts as current, even though som e of these am ounts may not be realized within one year.\n\nUse of Estimates. The nature of our business requires that we m ake estim ates and assum ptions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These estim ates and assum ptions affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statem ents, as well as the reported am ounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. W e base our estim ates on historical experience, currently available inform ation and various other assum ptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results m ay differ from  these estim ates.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Company-sponsored research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, including Aerospace productdevelopment costs, were $565 in 2024, $510 in 2023 and $480 in 2022.  R&amp;D expenses are included in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period in which they are incurred. Custom er-sponsored R&amp;D expenses are charged directly to the related contracts.\n\nThe Aerospace segment has cost-sharing arrangem ents with som e of its suppliers that enhance the segm ent's internal developm ent capabilities and offset a portion of the financial cost associated with the segm ent's product developm ent efforts. These arrangem ents explicitly state that supplier contributions are for reim bursem ent of costs we incur in the developm ent of new aircraft m odels and technologies, and we retain substantial rights in the  products  developed  under  these  arrangem ents.  W e  record  am ounts  received  from   these  cost-sharing  arrangem ents  as  a  reduction  of  R&amp;D expenses. We have no obligation to refund any am ounts received under the agreem ents regardless of the outcom e of the developm ent efforts. Under the typical term s of an agreem ent, paym ents received from  suppliers for their share of the costs are based on m ilestones and are recognized as received. Our policy is to defer paym ents in excess of the costs we have incurred.\n\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense consisted of the following:\n\n",

      "answer": "3M's foreign currency forward/option contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange risk, but the financial impact of these instruments is distributed across multiple sections of the financial statements. In 2021, the company recognized a $5 million gain on these contracts in cost of sales and a $11 million loss in other expense (income), net, indicating both operational and non-operational hedging effects. On the balance sheet, the fair value of these contracts was $54 million in assets and $19 million in liabilities under current hedging instruments, and $24 million in assets and $4 million in liabilities for non-designated instruments, showing a net positive exposure. Additionally, $38 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into cost of sales in 2021, reflecting the realization of previously deferred hedge gains.

      "answer": "3M's repayment of 600 million euros in Eurobonds in November 2021 reflects a proactive approach to managing its debt maturities and liquidity. From page_39, we see that this repayment was a significant contributor to the overall decrease in 3M\u2019s debt in 2021 and was partially offset by strong cash flow from operations. On page_43, the repayment is positioned as part of a broader 2021 debt reduction strategy that also included the early redemption of $450 million in debt. Finally, page_89 confirms the repayment and places it in the context of 3M\u2019s long-term debt maturities and extinguishments, showing that the company strategically manages its capital structure by addressing upcoming maturities while leveraging available liquidity. This coordinated approach indicates a disciplined strategy to optimize the capital structure by reducing near-term obligations while maintaining flexibility.",

        "Hop 2: [MMM](page_43) \u2192 Eurobonds: The Eurobond repayment is placed within the context of broader 2021 debt activity, showing how it aligns with other reductions like the early redemption of $450 million in notes, indicating a strategic effort to manage near-term liabilities.",
        "Hop 3: [MMM](page_89) \u2192 Eurobonds: The repayment is specifically called out in the section on long-term debt maturities and extinguishments, reinforcing that the company actively manages its debt profile to address upcoming maturities and maintain financial flexibility."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe Company's total debt was lower at December 31, 2021 when compared to December 31, 2020. Decreases in debt are further described in Note 12 and were largely due to the March 2021 early redemption via make-whole call offers of $450 million in debt and the November 2021 repayment of 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following 'Cash Flows from Financing Activities' section. As discussed in Note 12, during the second and third quarters of 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps that converted part of the Company's $1.0 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028.\n\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR's administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA stated it will cease publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that do not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023.The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments that utilize LIBOR as the reference rate and these agreements contain relevant fallback language. The Company's analysis of its other commercial contracts found that such contracts, as a general practice, do not reference LIBOR. 3M will continue its assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the transition period.\n\nEffective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its 'well-known seasoned issuer' (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M's previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company's medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Additionally, the August 2019 and March 2020 debt was issued under the WKSI shelf registration, but not as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented and credit facilities is included in Note 12.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n\nAt December 31, 2021, 3M had $4.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and approximately $1.7 billion was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2020, 3M had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.8 billion was held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and approximately $2.3 billion was held by the United States. The decrease from December 31, 2020 resulted from higher share repurchases of treasury stock, the March 2021 early redemption via make-whole call offers of $450 million in debt, and the November 2021 repayment of 600 million euros aggregate principal amount, partially offset by strong cash flow from operations.\n\n## Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):\n\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n",

The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in 'Change in short-term debt - net' in the preceding table. 3M's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.\n\n## 2020 Debt Activity:\n\nDecreases in debt related to the repayment of debt primarily consisting of the aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes and the 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured in May 2020 and August 2020, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances on their Japanese yen and euro credit facilities. In addition, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes maturing in September 2021 were repaid in December 2020 via make-whole-call offers. Increases in debt were related to the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes. Outstanding commercial paper decreased $150 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.\n\n## Repurchases of Common Stock:\n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company's stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2021, the Company purchased $2.2 billion of its own stock. 3M repurchased shares, after having suspended repurchases (with other repurchase activity limited to 3M's stock compensation plans) in the first quarter of 2020. For more information, refer to the table titled 'Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities' in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company's stock.\n\n## Dividends Paid to Shareholders:\n\n3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2022, 3M's Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2022 dividend of $1.49 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.96 per share and marked the 64th consecutive year of dividend increases.",

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities.\n\nThe Company also had an additional $266 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2021. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Issuances and Fixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps\n\nThe principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table found at the beginning of this note.\n\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1.0 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index.\n\nIn March 2020, 3M issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.65%, $600 million of 10-year notes due 2030 with a coupon rate of 3.05%, and $650 million of 30-year notes due 2050 with a coupon rate of 3.70%.\n\nIn February 2019, 3M issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes. These were comprised of $450 million of 3-year notes due 2022 with a coupon rate of 2.75%, $500 million of remaining 5-year notes due 2024 with a coupon rate of 3.25%, $800 million of 10-year notes due 2029 with a coupon rate of 3.375%, and $500 million of remaining 29.5year notes due 2048 with a coupon rate of 4.00%. Issuances of the 5-year and 29.5-year notes were pursuant to a reopening of existing securities issued in September 2018.\n\nIn August 2019, 3M issued $3.25 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 3.5-year notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 1.75%, $750 million of 5.5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.00%, $1.0 billion of 10-year notes due 2029 with a coupon rate of 2.375%, and $1.0 billion of 30-year notes due 2049 with a coupon rate of 3.25%.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments\n\nIn November 2021, 3M repaid 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured.\n\nIn March 2021, 3M, via a make-whole-call offer, redeemed $450 million principal amount of 2.75% notes due 2022. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $11 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\n\nIn December 2020, 3M, via make-whole-call offers, repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% notes and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% notes, both of which were due to mature in 2021. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $10 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\n\nIn May 2020, 3M repaid 650 million euros aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured. In August 2020, 3M repaid $500 aggregate principal amount of floating rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn June 2019, 3M repaid $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2019, 3M also assumed approximately $2.6 billion of debt in connection with the acquisitions of Acelity and M*Modal (See Note 3) of which $2.1 billion was immediately redeemed or paid at close.\n\n## In-Substance Defeasance\n\nIn conjunction with the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity (see Note 3), 3M assumed outstanding debt of the business, of which $445 million in principal amount of third lien senior secured notes (Third Lien Notes) maturing in 2021 with a coupon rate of 12.5% was not immediately redeemed at closing. Instead, at closing, 3M satisfied and discharged the Third Lien Notes via an insubstance defeasance, whereby 3M transferred cash equivalents and marketable securities to a trust with irrevocable",

      "question": "How did 3M's defeasance and discharge of the Third Lien Notes in 2020 reflect a distinct approach to debt management compared to its other 2020 debt transactions, particularly in terms of execution mechanism and capital structure impact?",
      "answer": "In 2020, 3M used an in-substance defeasance to discharge the $445 million in principal amount of Third Lien Notes assumed from the Acelity acquisition, transferring cash equivalents and marketable securities to a restricted trust specifically for that purpose. This contrasts with other 2020 debt repayments, such as the $650 million euros of floating-rate medium-term notes in May and the $500 million of floating-rate notes in August, which were paid directly at maturity using existing liquidity sources. Additionally, in December 2020, 3M repaid $1 billion in notes via make-whole call offers. The defeasance mechanism for the Third Lien Notes was unique in that it involved a trust with irrevocable instructions, separating it from the company\u2019s operational funds, whereas other repayments were executed through direct cash outflows. This suggests that 3M tailored its debt management strategy based on instrument-specific features and acquisition-related obligations, balancing immediate redemption with structured defeasance to manage capital structure efficiently.",

The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in 'Change in short-term debt - net' in the preceding table. 3M's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.\n\n## 2020 Debt Activity:\n\nDecreases in debt related to the repayment of debt primarily consisting of the aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes and the 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured in May 2020 and August 2020, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances on their Japanese yen and euro credit facilities. In addition, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes maturing in September 2021 were repaid in December 2020 via make-whole-call offers.

The trust assets were restricted from use in 3M's operations and were only used for the redemption of the Third Lien Notes that occurred in May 2020.\n\n## Floating Rate Notes\n\nAt various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004, 3M issued a forty-year $60 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.\n\n## NOTE 13. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, effective in the first quarter of 2021, 3M made a change in accounting principle for net periodic pension and postretirement plan cost. This impacted the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of net unamortized actuarial gains or losses expense components of net periodic benefit cost. This change was applied retrospectively to all periods presented within 3M's financial statements.\n\n3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In total, 3M has over 75 defined benefit plans in 28 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participant's years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.\n\nThe Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.\n\nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant's total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees' elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $231 million, $201 million and $186 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were $117 million, $103 million and $96 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIn May 2019 (as part of the 2019 restructuring actions discussed in Note 5), the Company began offering a voluntary early retirement incentive program to certain eligible participants of its U.S. pension plans who met age and years of pension service requirements. The eligible participants who accepted the offer and retired by July 1, 2019 received an enhanced pension benefit. Pension benefits were enhanced by adding one additional year of pension service and one additional year of age for certain benefit calculations. Approximately 800 participants accepted the offer and retired before July 1, 2019. As a result, the Company incurred a $35 million charge related to these special termination benefits in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-operating $32 million settlement expense in its U.S. non-qualified pension plan. The charge is related to lump sum payments made to employees at retirement. The settlement expense is an accelerated recognition of past actuarial losses.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, as a result of the divestiture of the drug delivery business, the Company recognized a curtailment in its United Kingdom Pension Plan. The resulting re-measurement of the pension plan funded status reduced long-term prepaid",

Partially offsetting these increased costs were year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales (in 2020 within Safety and Industrial and in 2019 within Corporate and Unallocated), lower non divestiture-related restructuring charges year-on-year, in addition to benefits recognized in 2020 related to the restructuring and other actions taken in 2019 (and the adjustments thereto in 2020) along with continued cost management and productivity efforts.\n- On a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost increased expense year-on-year for both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Selling price and raw material impact:\n\n- In 2021, 3M experienced higher raw material, logistics, and outsourced manufacturing costs from strong end-market demand and ongoing COVID-19 and related global supply chain challenges that were further magnified by extreme weather events, such as February 2021 winter storm Uri in the U.S. These factors were partially offset by higher selling prices in 2021.\n- In 2020, higher selling prices in addition to lower raw material cost impacts benefited operating income margins year-onyear\n\n## Acquisitions/divestitures:\n\n- Divestiture impacts in 2021 and 2020 are primarily comprised of the lost income from the divestiture of the Company's drug delivery business (sale completed in May 2020).\n- Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of M*Modal (first quarter 2019), and Acelity (fourth quarter 2019). The net impacts related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. Financing costs related to these acquisitions is also included.\n\n## Foreign exchange impacts:\n\n- Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) increased operating income by approximately $103 million and decreased operating income by approximately $62 million (or an increase in pre-tax earnings of approximately $119 million and a decrease in pre-tax earnings of approximately $57 million) year-on-year for 2021 and 2020, respectively. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. Prior to 2021, for (a) 3M used prior year functional currency profits and nonfunctional currency purchase/transfer information as the base in determining these amounts. Comparative prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this updated methodology.\n\n## Other expense (income), net:\n\n- Higher income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense decreased expense year-onyear for both 2021 and 2020.\n- Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2021 compared to the same periods year-on-year. 2021 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2021.\n- Interest expense (net of interest income) increased in 2020, as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and lower year-on-year interest income driven by lower average interest rates on cash balances. 2020 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment charge in conjunction with the repayment of notes in December 2020.\n\n## Income tax rate :\n\n- Certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rates for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 17.8 percent, 19.7 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021 and a flat comparison from 2019 to 2020.\n- On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rates for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 17.8 percent, 20.3 percent, and 20.2 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 2.5 percentage points from 2020 to 2021 and an increase of 0.1 percentage points from 2019 to 2020.\n- The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.\n\n## Shares of common stock outstanding:\n\n- Higher shares outstanding decreased earnings per share per diluted share for 2021, while lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share diluted share for 2020.",

      "question": "How does RTX's discussion of the SEC Administrative Order in its risk factors, legal proceedings, and forward-looking risk disclosures reflect both the operational and reputational implications of the order, and what are the potential consequences for the company's U.S. government contracting and compliance oversight over the next three years?",
      "answer": "RTX faces significant operational and reputational risks stemming from the SEC Administrative Order entered into in October 2024. The order, which resolves investigations into FCPA violations and defective pricing claims, requires RTX to cooperate with a compliance monitor for three years and adhere to strict disclosure and compliance obligations. Failure to comply could result in the SEC vacating the order and instituting proceedings, which could lead to additional penalties and reputational harm. Furthermore, the order is tied to Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) that defer criminal prosecution for three years, but any breach could trigger prosecution, suspension of export privileges, and increased regulatory scrutiny. The company also faces potential debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could negatively impact its competitive position and financial condition. These risks are highlighted across the legal proceedings section, risk factors, and forward-looking disclosures, indicating a comprehensive and ongoing compliance burden.",

In addition, during the term of the DPAs, the DPAs' transaction-related requirements may impact our ability to execute potential future divestitures within ex pected timeframes or consistent with expected valuation metrics, which could delay or impair our ability to achieve the expected benefits from our strategic plan, or otherwise harm our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe are subject to litigation, environmental, anti-corruption, and other legal and compliance risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks.  These risks relate to, among other things, product safety and reliability, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, the use of artificial intelligence, ex port control, sanctions, employment matters, securities laws, competition laws, and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). Product recalls and product liability and warranty claims can result in significant damages and costs, including fines, as well as other harm to our business as discussed above. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.\n\nWe use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in certain of our operations. We also rely upon the use of chemical substances that are heavily regulated in connection with our products, manufacturing processes and operation of our facilities. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to potential non-compliance and both personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers or other illnesses incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties' employees, or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of  properties  and,  in  some  cases,  have  been  named  as  a  defendant  in  related  'tox ic  tort'  claims.  We  are  also  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  that:  (1)  impose requirements for chemical substances and the proper management, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (2) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (3) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, and/or reduce the risks of injury to people. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. A criminal violation of certain U.S. environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act could result in suspension, debarment, or disqualification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any U.S. government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the EPA approves the reinstatement of the facility. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. In addition, new laws, regulations, or governmental policies, sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nIn addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to U.S. and non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are, therefore, subject to the FCPA and other antibribery and anti-corruption laws, including the anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of non-U.S. countries. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and anti-corruption  laws.  Despite  meaningful  measures  that  we  undertake  to  ensure  lawful  conduct,  which  include  training  and  internal  control  policies,  these measures may not always prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws. As discussed above and as previously disclosed, in October 2024, the Company entered into a DPA with the DOJ and consented to the entry of an SEC Administrative Order to resolve investigations related to conduct that, among other things, violated the FCPA. We have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and could be subject to such",

If  convicted  or  found  liable,  the  U.S.  government  could  fine  and  debar  us  from  new  U.S.  government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years, and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. Further, our U.S. government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports' theories were to prevail in litigation, also  have  future  impacts  such  as  increasing  the  costs  absorbed  by  our  commercial  businesses.  We  have  made  voluntary  refunds  in  those  cases  we  believe appropriate,  have  settled  some  allegations,  and,  in  some  cases,  continue  to  negotiate  and/or  litigate.  We  may  be,  and  have  been,  required  to  make  significant payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in our favor, any such payments will be returned to us with  interest.  The  Defense  Contract Audit Agency  (DCAA)  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management Agency  (DCMA)  also  review  the  adequacy  of,  and  our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, earned value management, and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, including DCMA claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards. In some cases, the DOJ has conducted investigations or convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs. As discussed below and as previously disclosed, in October 2024, the Company entered into certain deferred prosecution agreements and a civil settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve investigations relating to pricing on certain government contracts. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by the U.S. government or must be refunded by us to the U.S. government if already reimbursed. An adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, if allegations of impropriety were made against us, we could suffer serious reputational harm, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\n\nA  violation  by  Raytheon  Company  or  the  Company  of  any  one  of  the  deferred  prosecution  agreements  or  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC) administrative order announced on October 16, 2024 could adversely affect our business. As previously disclosed, on October 15, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) (DPA-1) with the DOJ and on October 16, 2024, the Company became subject to an administrative order issued by the  SEC (the  SEC Administrative  Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by  Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), since 2012 in connection with certain Middle East contracts. On October 16, 2024, Raytheon also entered  into  a  DPA  (DPA-2)  and  a  False  Claims Act  (FCA)  settlement  agreement  with  the  DOJ  to  resolve  previously  disclosed  criminal  and  civil  government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. The Company made a settlement payment, criminal and civil penalties, restitution, and disgorgement, as applicable, pursuant to DPA-1, DPA-2, the SEC Administrative Order and the FCA settlement agreement as described in 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Pursuant to DPA-1, among other terms, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to Raytheon Company's alleged conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and alleged conspiracy to violate the AECA by failing to make related disclosures of certain payments that qualified as fees, commissions and/or political contributions under Part 130 of ITAR. Pursuant to DPA-2, among other terms, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to two counts of major fraud against the United States by Raytheon Company involving two legacy contracts. Under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company's and the Company's compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC's Administrative Order. DPA-1 and DPA-2 further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the deferred prosecution period that Raytheon Company or the Company has violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violations brought against Raytheon Company or the relevant Company in DPA-1 and DPA-2. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. Any breach of DPA-1, DPA-2, or the SEC Administrative Order could subject Raytheon Company or the Company to criminal prosecutions and/or administrative proceedings, resulting in additional criminal and civil penalties and fines, ex tension of either DPA's term(s), including the terms of the monitorship, increased future regulatory and legal scrutiny by U.S. or foreign government agencies, additional reputational harm, additional compliance costs, suspension of export privileges and/",

      "answer": "RTX applies the cumulative catch-up basis to account for changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales on long-term contracts, which can significantly affect profitability due to the high level of judgment required in estimating costs and revenues over multi-year performance obligations. This method recognizes the cumulative impact of estimate changes up to the current period, based on the percentage-of-completion, amplifying the financial impact of revisions. Given that $80.7 billion in 2024 revenue came from such contracts\u2014particularly from Collins, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon segments\u2014these adjustments are material and complex. Auditors identified this as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity in management\u2019s assumptions around labor productivity, material costs, subcontractor execution, and customer-directed delays. Additionally, the frequency and magnitude of Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, especially on fixed-price development contracts, introduce risk into financial reporting, requiring robust internal controls and extensive auditor scrutiny to ensure the reasonableness and consistency of these estimates.",

Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates.\n\nLong-Term Contract Accounting. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage-of-completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management's judgment. We review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant  contracts,  we  review  our  EACs  more  frequently.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be  performed  on  many  of  the  Company's  performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of  customer-directed  delays  or  reductions  in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenues and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage-of-completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also",

For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the ex isting contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss  provisions  on  contracts  are  recognized  to  the  ex tent  that  estimated  contract  costs  ex ceed  the  estimated  consideration  from  the  products  or  services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product  sold  under  contract  and,  in  the  commercial  engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  future  highly-probable  sales  of  replacement  parts  required  by regulation that are ex pected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, when the OEM product is sold for a loss, but the combined OEM and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate.

Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Contract Estimates at Completion\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the Company's revenues of $80.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. The Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney segments primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment manufacturer and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry, while the Raytheon segment primarily provides products and services to government customers in the defense industry. For certain long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period, and the Company generally accounts for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. Substantially all of the defense business revenue is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Management reviews the estimated costs at completion at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs and requires significant judgment by management on a contract-by-contract  basis. As  part  of  this  process,  management  reviews  information  including,  but  not  limited  to,  any  outstanding  key  contract  matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management's judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management makes assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, including any impact from rising costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, ex ecution by its subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the performance obligations.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - contract estimates at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion, including significant judgments and assumptions on a contract-by-contract basis, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management's estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion for contracts.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the estimated total revenue and total costs at completion, including evaluating on a test basis the reasonableness of certain significant judgments and inputs considered by management specific to each contract or performance obligation. Evaluating the significant judgments and assumptions related to the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion on  a  contract-by-contract  basis  involved  evaluating  whether  the  significant  judgments  and  assumptions  used  were  reasonable  considering:  (i)  management's historical",

      "answer": "RTX's cooperation obligations are deeply tied to three major legal resolutions: the Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters, DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes, and Trade Compliance Matters. These resulted in a combined pre-tax charge of $918 million in Q2 2024, with specific allocations of $364 million for the Middle East contract issues, $269 million for defective pricing claims, and $285 million for export control violations. These obligations require RTX to retain an independent compliance monitor for three years from engagement and fulfill cooperation and disclosure obligations across all matters. Additionally, under the SEC Administrative Order and DPAs, any breach could lead to prosecution, administrative proceedings, or extended monitorship, as seen in the $102 million SEC payment and $580 million DOJ payment made in Q4 2024.

As previously announced, in 2024 the  Company resolved several outstanding legal  matters,  herein  referred  to  as  'Resolution  of  Certain  Legal Matters.'  The  Company  entered  into  a  deferred  prosecution  agreement  (DPA)  (DPA-1)  with  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  and  the  Company  settled  an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with  the  DOJ  to  resolve  previously  disclosed  criminal  and  civil  government  investigations  into  defective  pricing  claims  for  certain  legacy  Raytheon  Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The  compliance  monitor  will  oversee  Raytheon  Company's  and  the  Company's  compliance  with  their  respective  obligations  under  the  DPAs  and  the  SEC Administrative  Order.  The  DPAs further provide that, in the event the  DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the SEC Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination  or  breach,  the  Company  may  face  additional  adverse  impacts.  In  addition,  the  Company  resolved  certain  voluntarily  disclosed  ex port  controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser ex tent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company  to  implement  remedial  compliance  measures  and  to  conduct  an  external  audit  of  the  Company's  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  (ITAR) compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. As a result of the DPAs, SEC Administrative Order, FCA settlement agreement and CA, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of $ 918 million during the second quarter of 2024, which included $269 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), $364 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and $285 million related to Trade Compliance Matters. In the fourth quarter we made payments of $580 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Dispute and $384 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters. See 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' for additional information.\n\nRussia Sanctions. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company's management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers. As a result of the Canadian government's imposition of sanctions in February 2024, including those imposed on U.S.- and German-based Russian-owned entities from which we source titanium for use in our Canadian operations, we recorded charges of $175 million in the first quarter of 2024 within our Collins Aerospace",

The investigation involved multi-year contracts subject to governmental regulation, including defective pricing claims for certain Raytheon Company contracts entered into  between  2011  and  2013. As  part  of  the  same  investigation,  on  March  24,  2021,  the  Company  received  a  second  criminal  subpoena  from  the  DOJ  seeking documents relating to a certain contract entered into in 2017 by Raytheon Company. As previously disclosed on July 25, 2024, following the government's and the Company's own internal investigations, the Company engaged in resolution discussions with the DOJ, and during the second quarter of 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the DOJ as to the principal elements of such resolution. In addition, the Company cooperated with the DOJ with respect to a related civil defective pricing investigation under the FCA. On October 16, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into DPA-2 and the FCA Settlement Agreement with the DOJ to resolve these matters. Pursuant to DPA-2, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to two counts of major fraud  against  the  United  States  by  Raytheon  Company  involving  two  legacy  contracts.  If  Raytheon  Company  and  the  Company  fully  comply  with  all  of  their respective obligations in DPA-2 during its three-year term (commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged), the DOJ will move for dismissal with prejudice of the deferred charges against Raytheon Company. DPA-2 provides for a criminal penalty in the amount of $147 million, plus restitution, and the FCA Settlement Agreement provides for an FCA settlement payment in the amount of $433 million, which includes restitution that will satisfy the criminal restitution obligation when paid. Under DPA-2 as well as DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order discussed in 'Thales-Raytheon Systems  and  Related  Matters'  above,  Raytheon  Company  and  the  Company  are  required,  among  other  things,  to  retain  an  independent  compliance  monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC's Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company's and the Company's compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-2 as well as DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order discussed in 'Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters' above. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company paid $580 million in the aggregate for DPA-2 and the FCA Settlement Agreement which was consistent with amounts accrued plus interest. The Company does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\n\n## Trade Compliance Matters\n\nFrom time to time, we identify, investigate, remediate, and voluntarily disclose violations or potential violations of the ITAR and EAR to the relevant regulators. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of State's (DOS) Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (DTCC) informed the Company of its intent to seek administrative penalties for alleged violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The DTCC informed us that it considers certain of our voluntary disclosures, primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, filed since 2019 to reflect deficiencies warranting a civil penalty. On August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve these matters. The CA settles certain AECA and ITAR compliance matters with the DTCC and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The CA has a three-year term and provides for: (i) a civil penalty of $200 million, $100 million of which is suspended on the condition that such amount is applied to DTCC-approved remedial compliance measures; (ii) the appointment of an external Special Compliance Officer (SCO) to oversee compliance with the CA, the AECA, and the ITAR; (iii) an external audit of the Company's AECA and ITAR compliance program; and (iv) implementation of additional remedial compliance measures related to AECA and ITAR compliance.

If  convicted  or  found  liable,  the  U.S.  government  could  fine  and  debar  us  from  new  U.S.  government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years, and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. Further, our U.S. government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports' theories were to prevail in litigation, also  have  future  impacts  such  as  increasing  the  costs  absorbed  by  our  commercial  businesses.  We  have  made  voluntary  refunds  in  those  cases  we  believe appropriate,  have  settled  some  allegations,  and,  in  some  cases,  continue  to  negotiate  and/or  litigate.  We  may  be,  and  have  been,  required  to  make  significant payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in our favor, any such payments will be returned to us with  interest.  The  Defense  Contract Audit Agency  (DCAA)  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management Agency  (DCMA)  also  review  the  adequacy  of,  and  our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, earned value management, and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, including DCMA claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards. In some cases, the DOJ has conducted investigations or convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs. As discussed below and as previously disclosed, in October 2024, the Company entered into certain deferred prosecution agreements and a civil settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve investigations relating to pricing on certain government contracts. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by the U.S. government or must be refunded by us to the U.S. government if already reimbursed. An adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, if allegations of impropriety were made against us, we could suffer serious reputational harm, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\n\nA  violation  by  Raytheon  Company  or  the  Company  of  any  one  of  the  deferred  prosecution  agreements  or  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC) administrative order announced on October 16, 2024 could adversely affect our business. As previously disclosed, on October 15, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) (DPA-1) with the DOJ and on October 16, 2024, the Company became subject to an administrative order issued by the  SEC (the  SEC Administrative  Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by  Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), since 2012 in connection with certain Middle East contracts. On October 16, 2024, Raytheon also entered  into  a  DPA  (DPA-2)  and  a  False  Claims Act  (FCA)  settlement  agreement  with  the  DOJ  to  resolve  previously  disclosed  criminal  and  civil  government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. The Company made a settlement payment, criminal and civil penalties, restitution, and disgorgement, as applicable, pursuant to DPA-1, DPA-2, the SEC Administrative Order and the FCA settlement agreement as described in 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Pursuant to DPA-1, among other terms, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to Raytheon Company's alleged conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and alleged conspiracy to violate the AECA by failing to make related disclosures of certain payments that qualified as fees, commissions and/or political contributions under Part 130 of ITAR. Pursuant to DPA-2, among other terms, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to two counts of major fraud against the United States by Raytheon Company involving two legacy contracts. Under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company's and the Company's compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC's Administrative Order. DPA-1 and DPA-2 further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the deferred prosecution period that Raytheon Company or the Company has violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violations brought against Raytheon Company or the relevant Company in DPA-1 and DPA-2. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. Any breach of DPA-1, DPA-2, or the SEC Administrative Order could subject Raytheon Company or the Company to criminal prosecutions and/or administrative proceedings, resulting in additional criminal and civil penalties and fines, ex tension of either DPA's term(s), including the terms of the monitorship, increased future regulatory and legal scrutiny by U.S. or foreign government agencies, additional reputational harm, additional compliance costs, suspension of export privileges and/",

      "answer": "RTX incorporates the estimated cost of satisfying ICIP agreements into long-term contract cost estimation processes, which directly affects profitability and revenue recognition (page_80 and page_59). These agreements are subject to evolving customer demands for higher-value commitments, including technology transfer and local production, which can delay contract awards and increase execution risk (page_16). The company must continuously update Estimates at Completion (EACs) to reflect changes in ICIP obligations, and any significant adjustments are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, impacting operating results. However, international regulatory dynamics and geopolitical uncertainties complicate RTX's ability to meet these obligations, potentially leading to financial penalties or losses. Therefore, the financial planning around ICIP agreements is tightly linked with both contract accounting practices and broader international risk management strategies.",

For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the ex isting contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss  provisions  on  contracts  are  recognized  to  the  ex tent  that  estimated  contract  costs  ex ceed  the  estimated  consideration  from  the  products  or  services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product  sold  under  contract  and,  in  the  commercial  engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  future  highly-probable  sales  of  replacement  parts  required  by regulation that are ex pected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, when the OEM product is sold for a loss, but the combined OEM and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of  customer-directed  delays  or  reductions  in  scheduled  deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and  estimates  regarding  contract  revenues  and  costs,  including  estimates  of  labor  productivity  and  availability,  the  complex ity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant  management  judgment,  as  development  contracts  by  nature  have  elements  that  have  not  been  done  before  and  thus,  are  highly  subject  to  future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price.\n\nChanges in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage-of-completion in the current  period. A  significant  change  in  one  or  more  of  these  estimates  could  affect  the  profitability  of  one  or  more  of  our  performance  obligations.  Our  EAC adjustments also include the establishment of, and changes to, loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis.\n\nNet EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results:\n\n",

The U.S. government has the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts, which would obligate us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. government, affecting our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability.  Our  U.S.  government  contracts  also  require  us  to  comply  with  ex tensive  and  evolving  procurement  laws,  rules  and  regulations  and  subject  us  to potential U.S. government surveillance, audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. government, which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes, and claims.\n\nOur international business is subject to economic, regulatory, competition, and other risks. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with political and economic factors, regulatory requirements, competition, and other risks. A significant portion of our sales are international, including U.S. export sales. Our non-U.S. operations transactions may be denominated in local currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (including their impact on supplier prices) may negatively affect demand for our products and our reported profits, as well as our operating margins. The majority of our commercial aerospace sales are in U.S. Dollars, while the majority of their non-U.S. operating costs are incurred in the applicable local currency. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations  in  ex change  rates  for  this  reason.  In  addition,  because  our  financial  statements  are  denominated  in  U.S.  Dollars,  currency  fluctuations  may  cause translation gains or losses for non-U.S. operating unit financial statements.\n\nOur  international  sales  and  operations  are  also  subject  to  risks  associated  with  local  government  laws,  regulations,  and  policies,  including  with  respect  to investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, repatriation of earnings, and tariffs. Differing legal systems, customs, and contract laws and regulations pose additional risk. International transactions may include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or that may be interpreted  differently  in  foreign  countries.  In  addition,  in  certain  foreign  countries,  we  engage  foreign  non-employee  representatives  and  consultants  for international sales and teaming with international subcontractors, partners, and suppliers for international programs. While we have robust policies and controls in place, these engagements expose us to various challenges including risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and local antibribery laws and regulations.  From  time  to  time,  we  have  disputes  with  such  representatives  regarding  claimed  commissions  and  other  matters  which  can  result  in  litigation  or arbitration. In addition, we face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products.\n\nOur international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans, marketing subsidies, and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies or our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. companies.\n\nOur international contracts, particularly for sales of defense products and services, may include offset obligations or industrial cooperation obligations requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements, technology transfer agreements, financial support obligations, or other local investments, sometimes in the form of in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements. Approvals of offset or ICIP thresholds and requirements may be subjective and time-consuming and may delay  contract  awards.  Certain  customers'  demands  are  increasing  for  greater  offset  or  ICIP  commitment  levels,  higher-value  content,  including  the  transfer  of technologies and capabilities,  and  local  production  and  economic  development.  In  addition,  our  ability  to  satisfy  customer  demands  relating  to  the  transfer  of technologies and capabilities under ICIP arrangements and other international contracts may be limited by U.S. government export controls.\n\nAs a result of the above factors, we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs, our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected, and we could incur losses on these programs that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nGeopolitical factors and changes in policies and regulations could adversely affect our business. Our international sales and operations are sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, foreign government budgets, and regional and local political and economic factors, including wars and armed conflicts, political or civil unrest,  volatility  in  energy  prices  or  supply,  inflation,  interest  rates,  changes  in  threat  environments  and  political  relations,  and  geopolitical  uncertainties.  Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in U.S. or foreign government laws, regulations, and policies, including those related to tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, export and import controls, other trade restrictions, and trade agreements. Events such as increased trade restrictions, retaliatory trade policies, or regime change can affect demand for our products and services, the competitive position of our products, our supply chain, and our ability to manufacture or sell products in certain countries.  Further,  operations  in  emerging  market  countries  are  subject  to  additional  risks,  including  volatility  in  rates  of  economic  growth, government instability, cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries.

Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates.\n\nLong-Term Contract Accounting. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage-of-completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management's judgment. We review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant  contracts,  we  review  our  EACs  more  frequently.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be  performed  on  many  of  the  Company's  performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis.

      "answer": "RTX accounts for offset obligations by incorporating their estimated costs into the transaction pricing of long-term contracts, which directly affects contract profitability and revenue recognition. As noted in page_80, if cash is paid to a customer to satisfy offset obligations, it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price, impacting the overall revenue recognized. Page_16 highlights that increasing customer demands for higher-value offset commitments, including technology transfers and local production, could negatively affect profitability due to the complexity and uncertainty in meeting these obligations. These obligations are also subject to U.S. export controls, which may further constrain RTX's ability to deliver on commitments. Finally, as page_59 explains, RTX reviews Estimates at Completion (EACs) frequently, especially for significant contracts, and makes adjustments based on changes in estimates, including those related to offset obligations. This dynamic accounting process reflects how offset obligations are not only a regulatory burden but also a financial variable that directly influences contract economics and reported profitability.",

For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the ex isting contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss  provisions  on  contracts  are  recognized  to  the  ex tent  that  estimated  contract  costs  ex ceed  the  estimated  consideration  from  the  products  or  services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product  sold  under  contract  and,  in  the  commercial  engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  future  highly-probable  sales  of  replacement  parts  required  by regulation that are ex pected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, when the OEM product is sold for a loss, but the combined OEM and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of  customer-directed  delays  or  reductions  in  scheduled  deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and  estimates  regarding  contract  revenues  and  costs,  including  estimates  of  labor  productivity  and  availability,  the  complex ity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant  management  judgment,  as  development  contracts  by  nature  have  elements  that  have  not  been  done  before  and  thus,  are  highly  subject  to  future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price.\n\nChanges in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage-of-completion in the current  period. A  significant  change  in  one  or  more  of  these  estimates  could  affect  the  profitability  of  one  or  more  of  our  performance  obligations.  Our  EAC adjustments also include the establishment of, and changes to, loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis.\n\nNet EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results:\n\n",

The U.S. government has the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts, which would obligate us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. government, affecting our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability.  Our  U.S.  government  contracts  also  require  us  to  comply  with  ex tensive  and  evolving  procurement  laws,  rules  and  regulations  and  subject  us  to potential U.S. government surveillance, audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. government, which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes, and claims.\n\nOur international business is subject to economic, regulatory, competition, and other risks. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with political and economic factors, regulatory requirements, competition, and other risks. A significant portion of our sales are international, including U.S. export sales. Our non-U.S. operations transactions may be denominated in local currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (including their impact on supplier prices) may negatively affect demand for our products and our reported profits, as well as our operating margins. The majority of our commercial aerospace sales are in U.S. Dollars, while the majority of their non-U.S. operating costs are incurred in the applicable local currency. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations  in  ex change  rates  for  this  reason.  In  addition,  because  our  financial  statements  are  denominated  in  U.S.  Dollars,  currency  fluctuations  may  cause translation gains or losses for non-U.S. operating unit financial statements.\n\nOur  international  sales  and  operations  are  also  subject  to  risks  associated  with  local  government  laws,  regulations,  and  policies,  including  with  respect  to investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, repatriation of earnings, and tariffs. Differing legal systems, customs, and contract laws and regulations pose additional risk. International transactions may include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or that may be interpreted  differently  in  foreign  countries.  In  addition,  in  certain  foreign  countries,  we  engage  foreign  non-employee  representatives  and  consultants  for international sales and teaming with international subcontractors, partners, and suppliers for international programs. While we have robust policies and controls in place, these engagements expose us to various challenges including risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and local antibribery laws and regulations.  From  time  to  time,  we  have  disputes  with  such  representatives  regarding  claimed  commissions  and  other  matters  which  can  result  in  litigation  or arbitration. In addition, we face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products.\n\nOur international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans, marketing subsidies, and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies or our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. companies.\n\nOur international contracts, particularly for sales of defense products and services, may include offset obligations or industrial cooperation obligations requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements, technology transfer agreements, financial support obligations, or other local investments, sometimes in the form of in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements. Approvals of offset or ICIP thresholds and requirements may be subjective and time-consuming and may delay  contract  awards.  Certain  customers'  demands  are  increasing  for  greater  offset  or  ICIP  commitment  levels,  higher-value  content,  including  the  transfer  of technologies and capabilities,  and  local  production  and  economic  development.  In  addition,  our  ability  to  satisfy  customer  demands  relating  to  the  transfer  of technologies and capabilities under ICIP arrangements and other international contracts may be limited by U.S. government export controls.\n\nAs a result of the above factors, we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs, our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected, and we could incur losses on these programs that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nGeopolitical factors and changes in policies and regulations could adversely affect our business. Our international sales and operations are sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, foreign government budgets, and regional and local political and economic factors, including wars and armed conflicts, political or civil unrest,  volatility  in  energy  prices  or  supply,  inflation,  interest  rates,  changes  in  threat  environments  and  political  relations,  and  geopolitical  uncertainties.  Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in U.S. or foreign government laws, regulations, and policies, including those related to tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, export and import controls, other trade restrictions, and trade agreements. Events such as increased trade restrictions, retaliatory trade policies, or regime change can affect demand for our products and services, the competitive position of our products, our supply chain, and our ability to manufacture or sell products in certain countries.  Further,  operations  in  emerging  market  countries  are  subject  to  additional  risks,  including  volatility  in  rates  of  economic  growth, government instability, cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries.

Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates.\n\nLong-Term Contract Accounting. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage-of-completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management's judgment. We review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant  contracts,  we  review  our  EACs  more  frequently.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be  performed  on  many  of  the  Company's  performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis.

The senior note was valued as part of a $8,287 million fair value of the total AerCap investment at the end of 2021. This investment, including the note, was accounted for under the fair value option and reported as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value. Additionally, the AerCap senior note was included among Level 3 securities, which are primarily fair valued using non-binding broker quotes or other third-party sources that rely on unobservable inputs, introducing valuation uncertainty. The note also contributed to the $1,000 million in Mortgage and asset-backed debt securities reported in the financial instruments section.

Property, plant and equipment - net associated with operations based outside the United States were $7,198 million and $7,622 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nNOTE 24. SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION . We account for our remaining interest in Baker Hughes (comprising 166.6 million shares with approximately 16% ownership interest as of December 31, 2021) at fair value. As of November 3, 2021, our investment in BKR ownership reduced below 20%, and as a result, we no longer have significant influence in BKR. The fair value of our interest in Baker Hughes at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $4,010 million and $7,319 million, respectively. We recognized a realized and unrealized pre-tax gain of $938 million ($696 million after-tax) based on a share price of $24.06, a realized and unrealized pre-tax loss of $2,037 million ($1,562 million after-tax) based on a share price of $20.85 and a pre-tax unrealized gain of $793 million ($626 million after-tax) based on a share price of $25.63 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2021 gain and 2020 loss included a $129 million pre-tax derivative gain and a $54 million pre-tax derivative loss, respectively, associated with the forward sale of Baker Hughes shares pursuant to our previously announced program to monetize our Baker Hughes position. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we completed forward sales of 183 million and 28 million shares and received proceeds of $4,145 million and $417 million, respectively. In February 2022, we completed a forward sale of 50 million shares and received proceeds of $1,302 million. See Notes 2 and 3 for further information.

      "question": "What is the full financial and strategic implication of GE's ownership stake in AerCap, considering its forward-looking uncertainties, fair value reporting, and capital allocation disclosures?",
      "answer": "GE's ownership stake in AerCap, valued at $8,287 million as of December 31, 2021, is a significant asset that influences both its strategic planning and financial risk profile. In the forward-looking statements, GE highlights that the success and timing of exiting its equity ownership in AerCap is a key uncertainty that could materially affect its financial results and strategic objectives. This aligns with the fair value reporting in the financial statements, where the AerCap equity and senior note are marked-to-market, indicating GE's exposure to market volatility. Additionally, the capital allocation section reveals that proceeds from such dispositions, including AerCap, are central to GE's de-leveraging plans and broader capital strategy. Therefore, the stake in AerCap is not only a financial asset but also a pivotal component of GE\u2019s strategic pivot and liquidity planning.",

      "question": "How does GE's financial commitment to long-term service agreements for gas turbines align with its strategic positioning in a market expecting low-single-digit growth in gas generation, given the installed base of over 7,000 units?",
      "answer": "GE has a strong installed base of over 7,000 gas turbines, with approximately 1,800 units under long-term service agreements (page 26), which provides a stable revenue stream and reinforces its strategic positioning in the gas power market. Despite global gas generation declining in the short term due to higher gas prices, GE notes that gas turbine utilization remains resilient, with megawatt hours growing in the high-single digits due to new HA turbine installations running baseload power (page 26). This aligns with GE\u2019s broader strategic focus on the energy transition, where gas turbines are positioned as a critical bridge technology to support renewable integration and grid stability (page 5). The company\u2019s investment in gas power services and new technologies like HA turbines reflects a forward-looking strategy to maintain relevance and profitability in a market that is expected to grow low-single digits over the next decade, despite current headwinds.",

          "chunk_text": "ABOUT GENERAL ELECTRIC. General Electric Company (General Electric, GE or the Company) is a high-tech industrial company that operates worldwide through its four segments, Aviation, Healthcare, Renewable Energy, and Power. Our products include commercial and military aircraft engines and systems; healthcare systems and pharmaceutical diagnostics; wind and other renewable energy generation equipment and grid solutions; and gas, steam, nuclear and other power generation equipment. We have significant global installed bases of equipment across these sectors, and services to support these products are also an important part of our business alongside new equipment sales. As described further below, in November 2021 we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from our (i) Aviation business, (ii) Healthcare business and (iii) combined Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses. This section provides an overview of GE's business at a consolidated level. See the Segment Operations section within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) for more details about segment-level business descriptions, product and service offerings and competitive, regulatory and other trends, dynamics and developments. See also the Consolidated Results section within MD&amp;A and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our announced and recent business portfolio actions.\n\nWe serve customers in over 175 countries. Manufacturing and service operations are carried out at 71 manufacturing plants located in 26 states in the United States and Puerto Rico and at 130 manufacturing plants located in 33 other countries.\n\nOver our 130-year history, GE's innovation and technology have improved quality of life around the world. GE's businesses today are working to adapt and innovate solutions to three of the world's most pressing challenges: the future of smarter and more efficient flight, precision healthcare that personalizes diagnoses and treatments and the energy transition to drive decarbonization.\n\n- Future of flight - The future of flight will be defined by how the aviation industry emerges from the current market cycle and innovates to lower emissions and improves fuel efficiency. The focus on long-term sustainability has accelerated notwithstanding the significant challenges that the industry has faced, and continues to face, with the significant disruptions and decreases in commercial air travel globally in connection with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our Aviation business over many decades has contributed to advances in engine architectures, aerodynamics and materials and the use of sustainable aviation fuels that have resulted in today's aircraft engines consuming significantly less fuel with lower emissions. The Aviation business continues to invest in and work toward development of the next suite of engine technologies, including open fan architectures, hybrid electric and electrical propulsion concepts and advanced thermal management concepts, that offer the potential for future efficiency improvements and emission reductions to meet our customers' needs and global standards governing commercial aviation.\n- Precision health - The healthcare industry faces the need to address productivity challenges by improving access, enabling more precise patient diagnosis and treatment, shortening hospital stays and wait times and lowering overall costs. Amidst the limited resources and burdens on healthcare systems, both from the COVID-19 pandemic recently and from aging populations more generally, these challenges are even more pronounced. Our Healthcare business is working to help support the future of healthcare that will merge clinical medicine and data science by applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence across the patient journey. With its products, services and digital capabilities, the Healthcare business is focused on building an intelligencebased healthcare system and a healthier world and greater access to the half of the world's population that is underserved.\n- Energy transition - Addressing climate change is an urgent global priority, and at the same time energy demand is increasing and roughly one billion people around the world are without access to reliable power. Our Renewable Energy and Power businesses play a central role in helping our customers meet this demand for electricity generation while lowering carbon intensity and making power generation more reliable, affordable and sustainable. These businesses' technology and expertise include onshore and offshore wind turbines, gas turbines and digital controls and hardware solutions that bring more renewables onto power grids while making the grid more resilient. Increasingly there is a focus on the potential for breakthrough technologies that can help drive deeper decarbonization of the power sector in the future, such as small modular or other advanced nuclear power, hydrogen and carbon capture. Progress in significantly reducing power sector emissions in the near term, while significantly accelerating technological innovation for higher renewable penetration and lower carbon-power generation, will also enable further emission reductions of other sectors through the electrification of transportation, heat and industry.\n\nWe believe our businesses' strategies and focus on these significant global challenges are well aligned with broader goals of sustainable development, and we approach sustainability with GE's commitment to innovation as a central element. Sustainability priorities are embedded in our policies, leadership engagement, operating mechanisms, commitments, and, ultimately, our products. In addition to working to develop technologies that will help build a more sustainable world, we advance GE's sustainability priorities through our own commitments to our people, communities and planet. More information that may be of interest to a variety of stakeholders about GE's sustainability approach, priorities and performance, including about safety, greenhouse gas emission reductions for our own operations and for our products, environmental stewardship, diversity and inclusion (as also discussed further below), supply chain and human rights and other matters, can be found in our Sustainability Report.\n\nIn all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive environment is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we continue to make improvements through deployment of lean initiatives and we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate.",

          "chunk_text": "POWER. Power serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide with products and services related to energy production. Our products and technologies harness resources such as oil, gas, fossil, diesel and nuclear to produce electric power and include gas and steam turbines, full balance of plant, upgrade and service solutions, as well as data-leveraging software. We have organized the businesses within our Power segment into Gas Power, Steam, Power Conversion and Nuclear and other.\n\nGas Power - offers a wide spectrum of heavy-duty and aeroderivative gas turbines for utilities, independent power producers and numerous industrial applications, ranging from small, mobile power to utility scale power plants. Gas Power also delivers maintenance and service solutions across total plant assets and over their operational lifecycle.\n\nSteam Power -offers a broad portfolio of technologies and services predominately for nuclear and fossil power plants to help customers deliver reliable power as they transition to a lower carbon future.\n\nPower Conversion, Nuclear and other - applies the science and systems of power conversion to provide motors, generators, automation and control equipment and drives for energy intensive industries such as marine, oil and gas, mining, rail, metals and test systems. Through joint ventures with Hitachi, it also provides nuclear technology solutions for boiling water reactors including reactor design, reactor fuel and support services.\n\nCompetition &amp; Regulation. Worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. Demand for power generation is global, and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. Our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards. In addition, we are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, where it will remain important to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come, which will likely depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today, but may become more important over time (such as hydrogenbased power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular or other advanced nuclear power).\n\nSignificant Trends &amp; Developments. Power continues to streamline its business to better align with market demand and drive its business units with an operational rigor and discipline that is focused on its customers' lifecycle experience. We remain focused on our underwriting discipline, commercial selectivity and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles and we have a high confidence to deliver for our customers.\n\nDuring the current period, global gas generation was down low-single-digits due to higher gas prices. However, GE gas turbine utilization continues to be resilient as megawatt hours grew high-single-digits from incremental HA gas turbine units coming online running baseload power. Looking ahead, we anticipate the power market to continue to be impacted by overcapacity in the industry, continued price pressure from competition on servicing the installed base, and the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets, as well as the ongoing impacts of COVID-19. Although market factors related to the energy transition such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand (and related financing), to differing degrees across markets globally, we expect the gas market to remain stable through the next decade with gas generation continuing to grow low-single-digits. We believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition and are encouraged by the growth in Gas Power Services.\n\nAs separately announced on February 10, 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for GE Steam Power to sell a portion of its business to \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France S.A. (EDF), which will result in a reclassification of that business to held for sale in the first quarter of 2022. A non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge will be taken related to the remaining business intangible and fixed assets of approximately $0.7 to $0.8 billion. The sale transaction is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2023, subject to completion of the parties' respective information and consultation processes and satisfaction of certain conditions, and closing the transaction is expected to result in a significant gain.\n\nWe continue to invest in new product development, such as our HA-Turbines and Nuclear small modular reactors. Our fundamentals remain strong with approximately $68.7 billion in RPO and a gas turbine installed base greater than 7,000 units, including approximately 1,800 units under long-term service agreements.\n\n",

On page 96, the pension plan reports $100 million in Cash and equivalents, with $19 million in Level 1 and $81 million in Level 2 fair value categories.

On page 83, GD reports $21 million in Cash and equivalents held in trust and measured at fair value, all in Level 2, compared to $7 million in 2022.

On page 109, the company reports a 12% year-over-year increase in raw material costs, which includes aluminum, directly linking the shortage to financial pressures. Meanwhile, on page 30, HON discusses strategic sourcing adjustments and supplier diversification efforts aimed at mitigating the impact of such material shortages, indicating proactive measures to manage the risk. Together, these sections show a comprehensive view of the aluminum shortage\u2019s operational, financial, and strategic implications.",

Deloitte also excluded the entity from the audit of internal controls, aligning with management's decision based on materiality.

      "question": "What is the financial impact of Honeywell's investment in Quantinuum across its consolidated balance sheet, segment reporting, and customer contract obligations?",
      "answer": "Honeywell's investment in Quantinuum has a multifaceted financial impact across its reporting dimensions. On the consolidated balance sheet, Honeywell contributed an additional $270 million of cash to form Quantinuum and recorded a non-cash adjustment of $460 million in Additional Paid-in Capital. The fair value of Cambridge Quantum Computing's noncontrolling interest was $419 million at the close of the transaction. In segment reporting, Quantinuum is included within 'Corporate and All Other,' which is not a reportable business segment, and it contributes revenue from performance obligations satisfied at a point in time and over time. Regarding customer contract obligations, the remaining performance obligations within 'Corporate and All Other' specifically relate to the Quantinuum business, indicating its significance to future revenue streams. Together, these perspectives reveal the extent of Honeywell's financial commitment to Quantinuum and its strategic positioning within the corporate portfolio.",

      "question": "How does LMT's use of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition reconcile with its exposure to pension underfunding risks and the year-over-year sales growth dynamics observed in its Space and Aeronautics segments?",
      "answer": "LMT relies heavily on the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition, which involves significant management judgment in estimating total contract costs and revenues over long time horizons. This method directly affects earnings volatility, especially when cost estimates change due to technical, schedule, or performance risks. On page 54, LMT notes that changes in cost estimates can materially affect profit booking rates and that internal controls are in place to validate these estimates. Meanwhile, page 20 highlights the company's $6.2 billion unfunded pension obligation as of 2023, which is also sensitive to actuarial assumptions like discount rates\u2014similar in complexity and judgment to revenue estimation. The pension liability adds financial pressure that could be exacerbated by earnings volatility from contract reestimations. On page 33, LMT reports a $799 million increase in product sales, largely driven by the Space segment\u2019s NGI development program, and a $788 million rise in service sales, mainly from Aeronautics\u2019 F-35 sustainment contracts. These growth areas are tied to long-term contracts accounted for under the same percentage-of-completion method, meaning that future earnings and cash flows from these programs will be directly influenced by the accuracy of cost and revenue projections, which in turn could affect the company\u2019s ability to fund its pension obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT (page_54) \u2192 Percentage-of-Completion Cost-to-Cost Method: LMT uses this method for most of its revenue, requiring significant management estimates and assumptions. Changes in cost estimates can materially affect profit booking rates, and internal controls are in place to validate these estimates.",
        "Hop 2: LMT (page_20) \u2192 Percentage-of-Completion Cost-to-Cost Method: The method is highlighted as a source of earnings volatility due to its reliance on forward-looking assumptions. This volatility is compared to other judgment-based accounting areas, such as pension obligations, where a $6.2 billion unfunded liability is also sensitive to assumptions.",
        "Hop 3: LMT (page_33) \u2192 Percentage-of-Completion Cost-to-Cost Method: Sales growth in the Space and Aeronautics segments\u2014$799 million and $788 million respectively\u2014are tied to long-term contracts accounted for under this method, meaning future performance of these contracts will directly affect reported earnings and cash flows."

          "chunk_text": "| Description of the Matter                | For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation recorded net sales of $67.6 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporation's revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the Corporation measures progress towards completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs to complete the performance obligation(s) (referred to as the estimate-at-completion analysis). The Corporation estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at completion. The percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase.

For example, we tested internal controls over management's review of the estimate-at-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying the estimated contract value and estimated total costs to complete. We also tested internal controls that management executes which are designed to validate the data used in the estimate-at- completion analyses was complete and accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Description of the Matter                | At December 31, 2023, the Corporation's aggregate obligation for its qualified defined benefit pension plans was $29.0 billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan assets of $22.8 billion, resulting in a net unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of $6.2 billion. As explained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension assets and obligations at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events. The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate. Auditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate used in the measurement process. The discount rate assumption has a significant effect on the measurement of the projected benefit obligation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |",

      "question": "How does Lockheed Martin's strategic emphasis on hypersonics programs align with financial performance trends in its Aeronautics and Space segments, particularly considering the transition of these programs to production phases by 2026?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's strategic emphasis on hypersonics programs is highlighted in its 21st Century Security vision, where it is identified as one of four key areas for near-to-mid-term growth, with expectations that multiple programs will transition to early production phases through 2026. In the Aeronautics segment, the segment's operating profit decreased in 2023, partly due to lower net favorable profit adjustments on the F-35 program, which generated 26% of total consolidated net sales. This decline in a core program may place increased strategic importance on emerging areas like hypersonics to offset performance shortfalls. Meanwhile, the Space segment explicitly lists hypersonics programs as part of its major initiatives, including several with the U.S. Army and Navy to design and develop hypersonic strike weapons. These programs represent a critical investment area that aligns with the company's strategic growth pillars and may serve as a future revenue driver as they move into production, helping to balance financial performance across segments.",

        "Hop 3: [LMT](page_5) \u2192 Hypersonics Programs: Space segment lists hypersonics as a major program with U.S. Army and Navy contracts for hypersonic strike weapons, indicating cross-segment implementation and investment."

      "question": "How does LMT's exposure to offset agreements, including their $21.3 billion in remaining obligations and potential $2.3 billion in penalties, reconcile with their international sales strategy, cost structure, and risk management approach given the geopolitical and operational risks outlined?",
      "answer": "LMT's offset agreements, totaling $21.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, are a core component of their international sales strategy, particularly for defense procurements where foreign customers often require industrial cooperation commitments. These agreements are embedded in the cost structure of contracts, as noted in the cost of sales section, which includes expenses related to fulfilling offset obligations. However, the agreements also pose significant risks, including potential penalties of $2.3 billion if commitments are not met, which could be impacted by geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, or joint venture performance. LMT acknowledges these risks in the broader risk factors section, noting that failure to meet offset requirements could lead to reduced future sales and penalties, especially in markets where local capabilities may not align with the scope of commitments. This interplay shows that while offset agreements are strategically used to secure international contracts, they also introduce financial and operational complexity that must be carefully managed.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT (page_16) \u2192 Offset Agreements: LMT highlights the risk of not meeting offset agreement obligations, which could result in penalties or reduced future sales, especially in international markets with complex regulatory and operational environments.",
        "Hop 2: LMT (page_46) \u2192 Offset Agreements: LMT discloses that as of December 31, 2023, it has $21.3 billion in remaining offset obligations and $2.3 billion in potential penalties, underscoring the financial exposure tied to these agreements.",
        "Hop 3: LMT (page_34) \u2192 Offset Agreements: Offset costs are included in the cost of sales, indicating that these obligations are directly tied to contract-level financial planning and execution."

      "answer": "General Dynamics operates under three contract types\u2014fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, and time-and-materials\u2014with cost-reimbursement contracts accounting for 36% of U.S. government revenue in 2021 and 35% in 2020 and 2019. These contracts involve lower risk for the company, as the customer reimburses incurred costs and pays a fixed, incentive, or award-based fee tied to performance metrics like cost, quality, and schedule. However, the lower risk is reflected in lower base fees compared to fixed-price contracts, which accounted for 59% of U.S. government revenue in 2021. Fixed-price contracts carry more risk but offer potential for additional profit if work is completed under budget. In the global context, General Dynamics receives non-U.S. revenue through both direct sales and the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, where the U.S. government assumes collection risk. This mix suggests a strategic balance between risk and reward, leveraging cost-reimbursement contracts for stability while relying on fixed-price contracts for growth and profitability.",

Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. These fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under timeand-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.\n\nEach of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages. Typically, we assume more risk with fixed-price contracts. However, these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less than originally estimated. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk. Accordingly, the associated  base  fees  are  usually  lower  than  fees  earned  on  fixed-price  contracts.  Under  time-and-materials contracts,  our  profit  may  vary  if  actual  labor-hour  rates  vary  significantly  from  the  negotiated  rates.

The majority of this revenue was for business jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries.\n\n## NON-U.S.\n\nOur revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $6.8 billion in 2021, $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7.6 billion in 2019, which represented 18% of our consolidated revenue in 2021 and 2020 and 19% in 2019.\n\nWe conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries maintain longterm  relationships  with  their  customers  and  have  established  themselves  as  principal  regional  suppliers  and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services.\n\nOur non-U.S. commercial revenue consists primarily of business jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from customers outside North America represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 45% of the Aerospace segment's aircraft backlog on December 31, 2021.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nSeveral  factors  determine  our  ability  to  compete  successfully  in  the  defense  and  business-aviation  markets. While customers' evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include:\n\n- the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services;\n- our ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats;\n- successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems;\n- our global footprint and accessibility to customers;\n- the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and\n- the successful management of customer relationships.\n\n## DEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION\n\nThe U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against  other  contractors  as  well  as  smaller  companies  that  specialize  in  a  particular  technology  or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors' exports and the offerings of private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Marine Systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class",

      "question": "How did GD's exposure to equity funds change between 2020 and 2021 across both pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, and what does this reveal about their asset allocation approach?",
      "answer": "GD's exposure to equity funds decreased significantly between 2020 and 2021 in both pension and post-retirement benefit plans. In pension plans, equity fund holdings dropped from $6,592 million in 2020 (page_93) to $354 million in 2021 (page_95), a decline of over 94%. Similarly, in other post-retirement benefit plans, equity fund exposure fell from $7,306 million in 2020 (page_94) to $38 million in 2021 (page_93), a reduction of approximately 99.5%. This dramatic reduction suggests a major shift in asset allocation strategy, with GD significantly de-risking its retirement plan portfolios by moving away from equity market exposure.",

      "question": "Given GD's mix of contract types and the associated profitability risks, how does the relatively small proportion of time-and-materials contracts in U.S. government revenue (7% in 2021) align with the company's broader discussion of how these contracts can impact profitability due to labor rate variances and material cost management challenges?",
      "answer": "The relatively small share of time-and-materials contracts in U.S. government revenue (7% in 2021) suggests a limited exposure to the specific profitability risks associated with these contracts, such as labor-hour rate variances and lack of fees on material costs. However, GD's detailed discussion in Note B (referenced from page 16 and elaborated on page 63) explains that time-and-materials contracts can still significantly affect profitability due to the sensitivity of profit to actual labor costs and the lack of margin on materials. This implies that while the overall percentage is low, the company must still carefully manage these contracts to avoid margin erosion, especially in service-oriented or maintenance-based engagements. The alignment shows that GD strategically limits exposure to this contract type while acknowledging its inherent volatility in performance.",

        "Hop 1: GD (page_63) \u2192 Time-and-Materials Contracts: Discusses the profitability risks of these contracts, including variability in profit due to labor-hour rate differences and lack of fees on material costs.",

        "Hop 3: GD (page_15) \u2192 Time-and-Materials Contracts: Notes that U.S. government revenue is derived from fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, and time-and-materials contracts, with production contracts primarily fixed-price and services typically under cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials."

Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. These fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under timeand-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.\n\nEach of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages. Typically, we assume more risk with fixed-price contracts. However, these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less than originally estimated. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk. Accordingly, the associated  base  fees  are  usually  lower  than  fees  earned  on  fixed-price  contracts.  Under  time-and-materials contracts,  our  profit  may  vary  if  actual  labor-hour  rates  vary  significantly  from  the  negotiated  rates.  Also, because these contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs, the content mix can impact profitability.",

Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.\n\nOf our U.S. government revenue, fixed-price contracts accounted for 57% in 2021 and 59% in 2020 and 2019;  cost-reimbursement  contracts  accounted  for  36%  in  2021  and  35%  in  2020  and  2019;  and  time-andmaterials contracts accounted for 7% in 2021 and 6% in 2020 and 2019.\n\nFor  information  on  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  each  of  these  contract  types,  see  Note  B  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\n\n## U.S. COMMERCIAL\n\nOur U.S.  commercial  revenue  was  $4.8  billion  in  2021,  $4.9  billion  in  2020  and  $6  billion  in  2019,  which represented 12%, 13% and 15% of our consolidated revenue in each of the respective years. The majority of this revenue was for business jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries.\n\n## NON-U.S.\n\nOur revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $6.8 billion in 2021, $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7.6 billion in 2019, which represented 18% of our consolidated revenue in 2021 and 2020 and 19% in 2019.\n\nWe conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries maintain longterm  relationships  with  their  customers  and  have  established  themselves  as  principal  regional  suppliers  and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services.\n\nOur non-U.S. commercial revenue consists primarily of business jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from customers outside North America represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 45% of the Aerospace segment's aircraft backlog on December 31, 2021.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nSeveral  factors  determine  our  ability  to  compete  successfully  in  the  defense  and  business-aviation  markets. While customers' evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include:\n\n- the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services;\n- our ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats;\n- successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems;\n- our global footprint and accessibility to customers;\n- the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and\n- the successful management of customer relationships.\n\n## DEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION\n\nThe U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against  other  contractors  as  well  as  smaller  companies  that  specialize  in  a  particular  technology  or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors' exports and the offerings of private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Marine Systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class",

      "question": "How do RTX's segment reporting practices, geographic asset distribution, and pension accounting differences collectively shape the company's treatment of acquisition-related adjustments?",
      "answer": "RTX's acquisition accounting adjustments are shaped by three key dimensions: segment reporting, geographic asset distribution, and pension accounting frameworks. From a segment perspective, acquisition adjustments include amortization of acquired intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustments, and customer contractual obligations amortization, which are excluded from management\u2019s evaluation of segment results. Geographically, long-lived assets such as fixed assets, net, are attributed to specific regions, influencing how acquisition-related fair value adjustments are distributed across regions. From a pension standpoint, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment reflects differences in pension cost recognition between Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), primarily impacting the Raytheon segment. The $272 million change in 2023 in this adjustment was driven by pension plan changes that affect how acquisition-related costs are ultimately recovered through pricing to the U.S. government, demonstrating the interplay between pension accounting and acquisition adjustments.",

      "answer": "RTX's 5.150% notes due 2033 were issued on February 27, 2023, with an aggregate principal balance of $1,250 million, as disclosed in both the February 2023 issuance details and the long-term debt schedule. These notes are consistently listed across two separate sections (February 2023 issuance and long-term debt composition), showing no change in principal balance, which indicates stability in this debt instrument since issuance. Additionally, the notes represent a distinct component of RTX\u2019s long-term debt portfolio, which totals $43,697 million as of 2023, highlighting the significance of this specific issuance within the broader capital structure.",

      "answer": "RTX issued $1,750 million in 6.400% notes due 2054 as part of its broader financing strategy, which includes various other notes and term loans. This issuance appears in both the detailed debt schedule and the long-term debt summary, showing it is a major component of RTX's long-term liabilities. When compared to other recent issuances like the 5.375% notes due 2053, the 6.400% notes carry a higher interest rate, suggesting a shift in borrowing costs over time. Furthermore, the total principal long-term debt for RTX in 2023 reached $43,697 million, with the 6.400% notes due 2054 contributing significantly to this figure, indicating a strategic reliance on long-dated debt to finance operations and growth.",

      "question": "What is the full financial and structural context of FedEx Express's use of Pass-Through Certificates, including their guarantee structure, asset backing, and how they fit into broader capital financing activities?",
      "answer": "FedEx Express issued $970 million of Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2020-1AA, with a fixed interest rate of 1.875% due in February 2034, which are secured by 19 Boeing aircraft with a net book value of $1.8 billion as of May 31, 2022. These certificates are structured through pass-through trusts and are not direct obligations of FedEx or FedEx Express, although FedEx fully and unconditionally guarantees FedEx Express\u2019s payment obligations. These certificates are part of a broader capital financing strategy that includes issuing $3.25 billion of senior unsecured debt in 2021, which was used to redeem $5.8 billion of outstanding debt and pay redemption premiums. Additionally, FedEx has entered into future leases for build-to-suit facilities totaling $3.4 billion, which are expected to commence between 2023 and 2024, indicating a layered approach to capital financing that combines asset-backed instruments, unsecured debt, and future lease obligations.",

Interest on our euro fixed-rate notes is paid annually. The weighted-average interest rate on long-term debt was 3.5% as of May 31, 2022. Long-term debt, including current maturities and exclusive of finance leases, had estimated fair values of $18.8 billion at May 31, 2022 and $23.1 billion at May 31, 2021. The estimated fair values were determined based on quoted market prices and the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of our long-term debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. This classification is defined as a fair value determined using market-based inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly.\n\nWe have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.\n\nFedEx Express has issued $970 million of Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2020-1AA (the 'Certificates') with a fixed interest rate of 1.875% due in February 2034 utilizing pass-through trusts.

      "question": "How did the evolution of FedEx's fuel surcharge tables across 2022 impact both cost recovery in transportation segments and pricing dynamics with customers, considering the frequency of table updates and the lag in international surcharge implementation?",
      "answer": "FedEx updated its fuel surcharge tables multiple times in 2022 (specifically on June 21, 2021, November 1, 2021, and April 4, 2022), which allowed for more frequent alignment with fuel price fluctuations. This helped offset a 77% increase in fuel expense driven by higher fuel prices, resulting in a net benefit to operating income as surcharges outpaced actual fuel cost increases. However, the surcharge mechanism includes a lag\u2014two weeks for domestic and six to eight weeks for some international surcharges\u2014potentially creating misalignment between current fuel prices and surcharge levels. This timing mismatch could either benefit or harm earnings in the short term depending on the direction of fuel price changes. Additionally, while the surcharges are a component of overall pricing, they are not the sole determinant, as service mix, base pricing, and discounts also influence yield and customer behavior.",

          "chunk_text": "The challenging labor market and inflationary pressures contributed to increases in purchased transportation, salaries and employee benefits, and other operating expenses in 2022. Higher fuel surcharges also contributed to increased purchased transportation costs. Salaries and employee benefits expense also increased in 2022 due to merit increases, partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense. Higher self-insurance accruals, increased costs related to information technology expenses, a charge related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a FedEx Ground legal matter, and additional volume-related expenses also contributed to an increase in other operating expense in 2022. Rentals and landing fees increased in 2022 primarily driven by increased vehicle and aircraft leases at FedEx Express, as well as network expansion at FedEx Ground.\n\n## Fuel\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges incorporate a timing lag of approximately six to eight weeks. We routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments. The net impact of fuel on operating income described below and for each segment below does not include the impact from these ordinary-course table changes.\n\nWhile fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price, and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered.\n\nIn order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharges on the trend in revenue and yield growth, we have included the comparative weighted-average fuel surcharge percentages in effect for 2022 and 2021 in the accompanying discussions of each of our transportation segments.\n\nFuel expense increased 77% during 2022 due to higher fuel prices. In addition to variability in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of fuel on our results. For example, our contracts for jet fuel purchases at FedEx Express are tied to various indices, including the U.S. Gulf Coast index. While many of these indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel. Furthermore, under these contractual arrangements, approximately 70% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week, with the remainder of our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day, rather than based on daily spot rates. These contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases.\n\nBecause of the factors described above, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term. For more information, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\nThe net impact of fuel had a significant benefit to operating income in 2022 as higher fuel surcharges outpaced increased fuel prices. The net impact of fuel on our operating results does not consider the effects that fuel surcharge levels may have on our business, including changes in demand and shifts in the mix of services purchased by our customers. In addition, our purchased transportation expense is impacted by fuel costs.\n\n## Other Income and Expense\n\nInterest expense decreased $104 million in 2022 primarily due to the 2021 debt extinguishment transactions further discussed in the 'Liquidity' section of this MD&amp;A and Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During 2021, we issued $3.25 billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement and used the net proceeds to redeem outstanding debt. In connection with our debt restructuring, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $393 million ($297 million, net of tax, or $1.11 per diluted share) in 2021. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\n## Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments\n\nIn 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM loss of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share), which includes a net loss of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of tax, or $3.76 per diluted share) related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans' assets and liabilities. These actuarial adjustments were due to lower than expected asset returns, demographic experience, and an update to the mortality assumption, partially offset by higher discount rates.\n\nIn addition, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM net loss of $260 million ($195 million, net of tax, or $0.73 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2022, of which $224 million was related to the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands Pension Plan. Effective October 1, 2021, the responsibility of all pension assets and liabilities of this plan was transferred to a separate, multiemployer pension plan. The remaining $36 million net loss was related to the U.S. FedEx Freight Pension Plan and consisted of a $75 million MTM loss due to a lower discount rate in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a $39 million curtailment gain.",

          "chunk_text": "In order to manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 2020 and November 2020 FedEx Express implemented temporary surcharges on all international package and airfreight shipments. These surcharges continued as peak surcharges beginning in November 2020 and remain in effect. Additionally, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Express has implemented a series of peak surcharges generally applying to U.S. domestic shipments that are oversized or require additional handling, and to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2022 holiday peak season. Effective January 17, 2022, the U.S. domestic holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect, and an additional residential surcharge was applied for customers who met certain volume thresholds. These changes reflect incremental costs associated with the challenging operating environment, while enabling FedEx Express to continue investing in service enhancement, fleet maintenance, technology innovations, and other areas to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.\n\nFedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. FedEx Express fuel surcharges are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges incorporate a timing lag of approximately six to eight weeks. The fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic freight services is assessed per pound of shipment. Effective June 21, 2021, November 1, 2021, and April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated. The weighted-average U.S. domestic and outbound fuel surcharges for the past three years were: 2022 - 13.1%; 2021 - 4.9%; and 2020 - 6.3%. See the 'Results of Operations and Outlook Consolidated Results - Fuel' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n## Operations\n\nFedEx Express's primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company's multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities to expand and modernize our Indianapolis hub and Memphis World Hub. See the 'Financial Condition - Liquidity Outlook' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland, and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nFacilities in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami - the Miami Gateway Hub - serves our South Florida, Latin American, and Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large European markets. In addition to its worldwide air network, FedEx Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and South America. FedEx Express's unique European road network connects more than 40 countries and territories through 19 transit hubs and over 540 stations.\n\nThroughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers, and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station's service area. In some international areas, independent agents ('Global Service Participants') have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see 'Item 2. Properties' of this Annual Report under the caption 'FedEx Express Segment.'\n\nFedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its retail locations.

      "answer": "FedEx fully guarantees the $970 million in Pass-Through Certificates issued by FedEx Express, which are secured by 19 Boeing aircraft valued at $1.7 billion as of May 31, 2024. This guarantee reflects a strategic financing mechanism that leverages asset-backed securities to fund aircraft acquisitions. However, capital expenditures for aircraft and related equipment at FedEx Express decreased in fiscal 2024, suggesting a shift toward financing through structured instruments like pass-through certificates rather than direct investment.

FedEx owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of each Guarantor Subsidiary. The guarantees are (1) unsecured obligations of the respective Guarantor Subsidiary, (2) rank equally with all of their other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and (3) are full and unconditional and joint and several. If we sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a G uarantor Subsidiary to any person that is not an affiliate of FedEx , the guarantee of that G uarantor Subsidiary will terminate, and holders of debt securities will no longer have a direct claim against such subsidiary under the guarantee.\n\nAdditionally, FedEx fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment obligation of FedEx Express in respect of the $788 million principal amount of the Certificates.

These leases are generally for build-to-suit facilities and equipment and have undiscounted future payments of approximately $0.9 billion and will commence when FedEx gains beneficial access to the leased asset. Commencement dates are expected to be from 2025 to 2027.\n\nFedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that are sufficient to pay principal and interest on certain pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates are not direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express.\n\nWe are the lessee under certain leases covering a portion of our leased aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase, finance, and lease these aircraft to us. These leasing entities are variable interest entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities, as the lease terms are at market at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fix ed-price purchase option, or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. Therefore, we are not required to consolidate any of these entities as the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure under these leases is included in the summary of future minimum lease payments.\n\n## NOTE 8: PREFERRED STOCK\n\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors, at its discretion, to issue up to 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

      "question": "How does FedEx's 2023 $11 million impairment charge for ShopRunner's customer relationships reconcile with its strategic emphasis on ShopRunner as a key trademark and the integration cost challenges described in its risk factors?",
      "answer": "FedEx recorded an $11 million asset impairment charge in 2023 related to customer relationships from the ShopRunner acquisition, indicating that the expected financial benefits from those relationships did not materialize as planned. Despite this impairment, FedEx continues to treat ShopRunner as a key part of its brand portfolio, listing it among essential trademarks like FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. At the same time, FedEx has acknowledged in its risk factors that integrating ShopRunner's systems and customer data with its own could require significant added expense, which may partially explain the impairment if integration challenges led to lower-than-expected returns. This combination of financial underperformance, ongoing brand significance, and high integration costs highlights the complexity of ShopRunner's role in FedEx's strategic portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand and goodwill.\n\nWe face intense competition. The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with flexible labor solutions such as crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nWe believe we compete effectively with these companies - for example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. However, the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs), which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offerings, if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or better service levels, more effectively bundle their services, or offer services at lower prices, it could adversely affect our results of operations. Continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition. Moreover, if high-volume package shippers further develop or expand internal capabilities for the services we provide, it may reduce our revenue and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. These effects could be exacerbated if high-volume package shippers offer such capabilities to third parties. News regarding such developments or expansions could also negatively affect the price of our common stock.\n\nOur industry may be affected by changes in technology and our competitors may implement emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence applications, more quickly and more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Advancements in technology, such as advanced safety systems; automated package sorting, handling, and delivery; autonomous delivery; third-party supply chain insight and management; artificial intelligence; vehicle platooning; alternative fuel vehicles; and digitization of freight services, may necessitate that we increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments. See 'We may be unable to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040.' below for additional information.\n\nOur businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels. We make significant investments in aircraft, package handling facilities, vehicles, technology, sort equipment, acquired companies, and other assets to support our transportation and business networks. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including our anticipated volume growth. We must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed. We must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes. Overcapacity could lead to below-market asset dispositions or write-downs, as well as negatively affect operating margins, and undercapacity could negatively affect service levels. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition - Results of Operations and Outlook - Consolidated Results - Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges' of this Annual Report for information regarding the noncash impairment charges recorded in 2024 and 2023 in connection with our decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines from service.\n\nOur inability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage, and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances and investments could materially adversely affect us. Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity, and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and investments, form joint ventures or strategic alliances, and realize the ex pected benefits from these transactions. We regularly acquire businesses, enter into strategic alliances, and make investments across the more than 220 countries and territories in which we provide services.\n\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions involve special commercial, customer, accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology, human resources, cultural, and other risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies. Additionally, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures and/or incur certain operating expenses following the completion of certain transactions, which may be higher than initially expected. For example, existing and future customer data and processes in the systems of FedEx and ShopRunner may require significant added expense to integrate.",

Those trademarks, service marks, and trade names are essential to our worldwide business, and include FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Services, FedEx Office, FedEx Logistics, FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Trade Networks Transport &amp; Brokerage, FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Custom Critical, and ShopRunner. Federal Express licenses the use of certain trademarks to support our business, and takes active measures to enforce its intellectual property rights where appropriate.\n\n## Regulation\n\nAir . Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the 'Federal Aviation Act'), both the U.S. Department of Transportation ('DOT') and the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') exercise regulatory authority over Federal Express's air operations.\n\nThe FAA's regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of Federal Ex press to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. Federal Ex press holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as Federal Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.\n\nThe DOT's authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT's jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. Federal Ex press holds various certificates issued by the DOT authorizing the company to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. These certificates remain in effect as we maintain our economic fitness to perform all-cargo services following the one FedEx consolidation.\n\nUnder the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration ('TSA'), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires Federal Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.\n\nFederal Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ('CRAF') program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of Federal Ex press's wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. Federal Ex press is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, Federal Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. Federal Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights.\n\nSee 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report for discussion of regulations related to pilots, including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations, that could affect our business.\n\nGround . The ground transportation performed by employees of Federal Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes, or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. Federal Express is registered in those states that require registration.\n\nThe interstate operations of Federal Express that utilize contracted service providers to conduct certain linehaul operations, as well as the interstate operations of FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical, are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates, routes, and services in interstate freight transportation.\n\nLike other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.\n\nInternational . Federal Ex press's international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the",

      "answer": "FedEx's $5.2 billion capital expenditure guidance for 2025 includes continued investments in Network 2.0, as well as the modernization of the Memphis and Indianapolis hubs (page_68). This capital allocation directly supports the Network 2.0 implementation progress, which has already expanded to more than 50 locations in the U.S., where contracted service providers and employee couriers are being utilized for pickup and delivery (page_55). The DRIVE transformation program, aimed at improving long-term profitability through efficiency gains and cost reductions, aligns with these capital investments by integrating Network 2.0 to optimize the enterprise linehaul network (page_55). Additionally, the $582 million in business optimization costs incurred in 2024 (page_92) further indicate the ongoing financial commitment to restructuring operations in support of Network 2.0 and the DRIVE program's strategic goals.",
