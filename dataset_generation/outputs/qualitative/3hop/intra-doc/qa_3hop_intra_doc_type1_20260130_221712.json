      "question": "What is the relationship between GM's strategic focus on crossovers as a core product line in its North American segment and its financial transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates involved in crossover production, particularly in light of GM's equity ownership stakes in those affiliates?",
      "answer": "GM positions crossovers as a key component of its strategic initiatives, produced and marketed under major brands like Chevrolet and GMC to maintain showroom traffic and support fleet sales. These vehicles are also manufactured and marketed in collaboration with nonconsolidated affiliates, particularly in international markets like China. GM has equity ownership stakes in these affiliates, which are involved in various aspects of crossover development and production. The transactions with these affiliates include purchases and sales of component parts and vehicles, indicating a strategic and financial interdependence. This suggests that GM leverages its nonconsolidated affiliates to scale crossover production without full financial consolidation, aligning with its broader strategic and operational segmentation.",

However, despite KAYAK's search queries being a core operational metric that drives user interaction, BKNG explicitly states that these search queries do not contribute to gross bookings.

      "question": "Given that NIKE includes accessories in its core product portfolio, how does the company's strategic focus on profitable growth in categories like accessories align with the reported 15% currency-neutral revenue decline in Converse, which also sells athletic lifestyle accessories?",
      "answer": "NIKE's strategy emphasizes profitable long-term revenue growth through innovative products, including accessories, as part of its broader portfolio. However, Converse, which operates as a separate reportable segment and also sells athletic lifestyle accessories, experienced a 15% currency-neutral revenue decline in fiscal 2024 due to drops in North America and Western Europe. This decline was driven by lower wholesale and direct-to-consumer sales, as well as increased promotional activity reducing ASP. The contrast between NIKE\u2019s strategic emphasis on accessories and Converse\u2019s performance suggests a potential misalignment or external market challenge affecting Converse disproportionately, despite the broader corporate strategy aiming for growth in similar product categories.",

However, page 75 reveals that GM engages in significant transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates for the development, production, and marketing of crossovers, including purchasing and selling component parts and vehicles. This reliance on external partners for a strategically critical product line introduces operational and financial dependencies that are not fully reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The combination of these disclosures suggests that while crossovers are central to GM's fuel efficiency and market positioning strategy, their production is partially outsourced to affiliated entities, potentially exposing GM to supply chain risks and profit-sharing limitations.",

      "answer": "GM positions trucks as a central component of its North American business, highlighting their importance in attracting customers, maintaining sales volumes for more profitable vehicles, and meeting fuel efficiency standards. Despite not managing on a vehicle-specific profitability basis, trucks are integral to the company\u2019s segment strategy. Meanwhile, GM engages in significant transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates involved in the development, production, and marketing of trucks and other vehicles. These relationships include purchasing and selling component parts and vehicles, indicating that nonconsolidated affiliates play a material role in supporting GM\u2019s truck production.

      "question": "How does the treatment of dividend equivalents on performance shares compare to the treatment of dividend equivalents on deferred shares, and what does this reveal about HD's compensation strategy for associates versus non-employee directors?",
      "answer": "HD accrues dividend equivalents on performance shares as reinvested shares, which are paid out upon the payout of the award after the three-year performance cycle. In contrast, dividend equivalents on deferred shares granted to non-employee directors accrue and are paid out in the form of additional shares upon termination of Board service. This reveals that HD structures dividend equivalents differently based on the type of award and recipient, with associates receiving performance-based awards tied to long-term company performance metrics (like ROIC and operating profit), while non-employee directors receive deferred shares that vest only upon service termination. The difference in payout timing and conditions reflects a strategic distinction in HD's compensation design: aligning associate incentives with multi-year performance goals versus providing deferred equity compensation for board service.",

      "answer": "The Cruise Class G Preferred Shares, issued in 2021, carry a four-year transfer restriction without written consent from both GM and Cruise Holdings' Board of Directors, while the Cruise Class F Preferred Shares, issued in 2019, had a transfer restriction until May 7, 2023\u2014approximately four years after their issuance. This indicates that GM has maintained a consistent strategy of limiting investor liquidity and preserving control over the timeline of Cruise Holdings' development and potential IPO. The alignment in restriction periods across both share classes suggests GM's intent to manage investor expectations and maintain strategic control over Cruise's commercialization path, particularly as both share classes convert into IPO shares at specified ratios. This reinforces GM\u2019s long-term approach to Cruise\u2019s monetization and strategic alignment with key investors.",

      "answer": "The foreign currency exposure arises because NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, sells products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating transactional risk when the U.S. Dollar fluctuates against those currencies. This exposure affects inventory costs, which are adjusted based on currency movements. In fiscal 2022, NIKE reported $59 million in inventories related to held-for-sale entities (Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile), indicating that the valuation of these inventories could be influenced by the same foreign exchange dynamics that affect NTC's intercompany sales. Therefore, the inventory cost adjustments due to foreign currency exposure from NTC's product sales could directly influence the carrying value and potential sale proceeds of inventories in NIKE's divestiture activities.",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period, hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. Additionally, the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company.\n\nThe purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs, non-functional currency denominated revenues, intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.\n\nProduct cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below.

      "question": "How does Nike's foreign exchange hedging strategy for product cost exposures through the Nike Trading Company (NTC) align with the financial impact of U.S. Dollar fluctuations on inventory costs described in the transactional exposures section?",
      "answer": "Nike manages foreign exchange risk related to product cost exposures by using derivatives designated as cash flow hedge instruments, particularly for purchases made through the Nike Trading Company (NTC), which operates in U.S. Dollars and sells to Nike entities in their respective functional currencies. This creates foreign currency exposure for the NTC when selling to entities with different functional currencies. In the transactional exposures section, it is explained that a stronger U.S. Dollar increases inventory costs for Nike entities purchasing in non-functional currencies, while a weaker Dollar reduces these costs. This indicates that Nike\u2019s hedging strategy through the NTC is designed to mitigate the financial volatility caused by these currency fluctuations, aligning with the broader risk management approach described in the transactional exposures section.",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

      "answer": "Nike reported $13.567 billion in apparel revenue across all geographic segments, indicating a major direct contribution from apparel to its core business. Converse, as a reportable segment, generated revenues primarily from licensing businesses, which are categorized under 'Other revenues' and contribute to Nike's broader revenue model through non-core, licensing-driven streams. This contrast highlights that while apparel is a substantial, direct revenue driver for Nike, Converse plays a more specialized, licensing-focused role within the company's diversified portfolio. The distinction suggests Nike prioritizes direct sales of high-volume product categories like apparel, while leveraging Converse for strategic brand exposure and licensing opportunities rather than core revenue generation.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Converse's revenue from $2,427 million in 2023 to $2,082 million in 2024 impact the overall performance of Nike's accessories segment, given that Converse is a key contributor to that category?",
      "answer": "The drop in Converse's revenue from $2,427 million in 2023 to $2,082 million in 2024 represents a $345 million decline, which is significant considering Converse is a key contributor to Nike's accessories segment. Since Converse is explicitly stated to design, market, license, and sell athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, its performance directly affects the broader accessories category. This decline suggests a potential contraction or stagnation in the accessories segment, especially given that Converse is one of the major brand contributors alongside Nike and Jordan. However, without explicit revenue figures for accessories alone, the full impact must be inferred through Converse's proportional contribution to that category.",

T he N IKE  Brand segm ents are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in N I KE  Brand sales activity.\n\nEach NIKE  Brand geographic segm ent operates predom inantly in one industry: the design, developm ent, m arketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipm ent. T he Company's reportable operating segm ents for the N IKE  Brand are: N orth Am erica; E urope, M iddle E ast &amp; Africa (\"E M E A\"); G reater C hina; and Asia P acific &amp; Latin Am erica (\"AP LA\"), and include results for the N IKE  and Jordan brands. R efer to N ote 18 - D ivestitures for inform ation regarding the transition of N IKE  Brand businesses in certain countries within AP LA to third-party distributors.\n\nThe Com pany's N IKE  D irect operations are m anaged within each N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ent. C onverse is also a reportable segm ent for the C om pany and operates in one industry: the design, m arketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.\n\nGlobal Brand D ivisions is included within the N IKE  Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way m anagem ent views the C om pany. G lobal Brand D ivisions revenues include NIKE  Brand licensing and other m iscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segm ent. G lobal Brand D ivisions costs represent dem and creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally m anaged for the N IKE  Brand, as well as costs associated with N IKE  D irect global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists prim arily of unallocated general and adm inistrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally m anaged departm ents; depreciation and am ortization related to the C om pany's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and com pensation program s, including stock-based com pensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.\n\nThe prim ary financial m easure used by the C om pany to evaluate perform ance of individual operating segm ents is earnings before interest and taxes (\"E BIT \"), which represents N et incom e before Interest expense (incom e), net and Incom e tax expense in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\nAs part of the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program , standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each N IKE  Brand entity in the C om pany's geographic operating segm ents and to C onverse. These rates are set approxim ately nine and twelve m onths in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and sum m er selling seasons) based on average m arket spot rates in the calendar m onth preceding the date they are established. Inventories and C ost of sales for geographic operating segm ents and C onverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. D ifferences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual m arket rates are included in C orporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from  the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and P roperty, plant and equipm ent, net for operating segm ents are regularly reviewed by m anagem ent and are therefore provided below.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 86",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE , I nc. is a worldwide leader in the design, developm ent and worldwide m arketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services. N IKE , Inc. portfolio brands include the N IKE  Brand, Jordan Brand and C onverse. T he N IKE  Brand is focused on perform ance athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services across M en's, W om en's and Kids', am plified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh tradem ark, as well as other N IKE  Brand tradem arks. T he Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jum pm an tradem ark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ents. C onverse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the C onverse, C huck Taylor, All Star, O ne Star, Star C hevron and Jack P urcell tradem arks. In som e m arkets outside the U .S., these tradem arks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, m arket and sell sim ilar products. O perating results of the C onverse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of N IKE , Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"C om pany\" or \"N IKE \"). All significant intercom pany transactions and balances have been elim inated.\n\n## MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statem ents in conform ity with generally accepted accounting principles requires m anagem ent to m ake estim ates, including estim ates relating to assum ptions that affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statem ents and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from  these estim ates.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of N IKE  Brand footwear, apparel and equipm ent, as well as C onverse products, com prise a single perform ance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to custom ers either through wholesale or direct to consum er channels. T he C om pany satisfies the perform ance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the custom er has occurred, based on the term s of sale. A custom er is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale custom ers upon shipm ent or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreem ent with the custom er. C ontrol transfers to retail store custom ers at the tim e of sale and to substantially all digital com m erce custom ers upon shipm ent. T he transaction price is determ ined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from  custom ers. P aym ent term s for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreem ent with the custom er and paym ent is generally required within 90 days or less of shipm ent to or receipt by the wholesale custom er. P aym ent is due at the tim e of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for tradem ark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangem ents, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governm ental authorities that are both im posed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the C om pany from  a custom er, are excluded from  R evenues and C ost of sales in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a custom er are accounted for as fulfillm ent costs and are included in C ost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration prom ised in the C om pany's contracts with custom ers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from custom ers. The C om pany estim ates the m ost likely am ount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against R evenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the tim e revenues are recognized. T he estim ated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 63",

      "answer": "The issuance of 2,894,424 shares to the 2019 Warrantholders in October 2024 increased the total number of shares outstanding, which directly affects the diluted net income per share calculation. According to the financial data, warrants contributed 8 million weighted average shares to the diluted share count in 2024, down from 11 million in 2023. This reduction aligns with the actual exercise of warrants, as seen in the issuance of shares to Warrantholders, which likely explains the decrease in the warrant-related share count. The execution of these warrants by Warrantholders thus diluted earnings per share to a greater extent than in the prior year, as the exercised warrants added to the total diluted share count.",

      "question": "How does Converse's reported revenue growth in fiscal 2022 relate to the overall performance of the apparel category across Nike's global brand divisions, particularly in light of Converse's licensing operations?",
      "answer": "Converse reported a 7% revenue increase in fiscal 2022, driven by growth in North America, Western Europe, and licensee markets, with a notable 22% rise in direct-to-consumer sales. This growth was partially offset by declines in Asia and lower wholesale revenues. A key component of Converse's revenue mix is its licensing operations, which are explicitly called out as a major contributor to 'Other revenues' in the Global Brand Divisions section. Meanwhile, the Apparel category across all Nike Brand segments totaled $13.567 billion in revenues, with Converse contributing only $103 million of that total. This indicates that while Converse is a growing contributor\u2014especially through licensing\u2014it remains a relatively small player in the broader Nike apparel ecosystem. The contrast between Converse's 7% growth and its modest $103 million apparel contribution highlights how its licensing model and regional performance are leveraged differently within the broader Nike portfolio strategy.",

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2022 due to revenue growth in North America, Western Europe and licensee markets, partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 22%, led by strong digital demand. Wholesale revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China as well as global supply chain constraints. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 6%, while ASP increased 12%, driven by growth in direct to consumer.\n\nReported EBIT increased 23%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense, while operating overhead increased primarily due to higher professional services costs.",

      "question": "Given Sojitz America's ownership of $0.3 million in redeemable preferred stock and the associated dividend restrictions, how does this financial instrument impact Nike's ability to declare dividends on common stock in light of the $990 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits that could affect future effective tax rates?",
      "answer": "Nike's ability to declare dividends on its common stock is directly constrained by the terms of the redeemable preferred stock held by Sojitz America, which requires that all cumulative dividends of $0.10 per share be declared and paid in full before any dividends can be paid on common stock. This creates a structural financial obligation that must be met before returning capital to common shareholders. At the same time, Nike faces a significant tax liability risk in the form of $990 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits, $699 million of which could affect the effective tax rate if recognized. This potential tax burden could reduce net income and retained earnings, further limiting the financial flexibility needed to meet preferred dividend obligations and, subsequently, to issue dividends to common shareholders. The balance sheet shows no value recorded for redeemable preferred stock as of 2024, suggesting no change in position, while retained earnings stood at $965 million\u2014potentially insufficient to absorb both the preferred dividend requirement and any adverse tax adjustments.",

        "Hop 2: Sojitz America \u2192 Redeemable Preferred Stock: The preferred stock grants Sojitz America specific voting rights on major corporate actions but no general voting rights, and it creates a binding financial obligation on Nike to prioritize dividend payments to Sojitz America.",

      "question": "How does BKNG's strategic investment in KAYAK align with the company's reliance on travel service providers, given the risk of short-term agreements and potential adverse effects on revenue if those providers reduce participation?",
      "answer": "BKNG's strategic investment in KAYAK, which is part of its broader acquisition strategy aimed at enhancing travel services, is closely tied to its reliance on travel service providers. KAYAK depends on access to real-time data from these providers to function as a meta-search service, but many of its agreements with them are short-term and can be terminated with 30 days' notice. This creates a risk that if providers reduce or stop sharing data, KAYAK's ability to offer comprehensive travel information\u2014and thus attract users and advertisers\u2014could be harmed. This risk is echoed in BKNG\u2019s broader business model, where a significant portion of its revenue comes from facilitating travel reservations through these same service providers. Therefore, while KAYAK represents a strategic growth opportunity, it also introduces a dependency that, if disrupted, could have a material adverse effect on BKNG\u2019s results of operations and market share.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BKNG(page_118) \u2192 KAYAK: BKNG has a substantial portion of its intangible assets and goodwill tied to the acquisition of KAYAK, indicating a strategic investment.",
        "Hop 2: KAYAK \u2192 Travel Service Providers: KAYAK depends on access to real-time travel data from service providers under short-term agreements, which can be terminated with 30 days' notice, posing a risk to its business model.",
        "Hop 3: Travel Service Providers \u2190 BKNG(page_48): BKNG derives substantially all of its revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations, highlighting a core dependency on travel service providers across its operations."

          "chunk_text": "reservations to customers through us. We are in regular dialogue with our major travel service providers about the nature and extent of their participation in our services. A significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service providers or providers that are particularly popular with consumers for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share, and results of operations. To the extent any of those major or popular travel service providers ceased to participate in our services in favor of one of our competitors' services or decided to require consumers to purchase services directly from them, our business, market share, and results of operations could be harmed. During periods of higher occupancy rates, accommodation providers may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservations through thirdparty intermediaries like us, in particular through our discount services. Further, as consolidation among travel service providers increases, the potential adverse effect of a decision by any particular significant travel service provider (such as a large hotel chain, airline, or rental car company) to withdraw from or reduce its participation in our services also increases. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk that our travel service provider and restaurant partners voluntarily or involuntarily declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease or limit their operations, which could harm our business and results of operations. In particular, the potential harm to our business and results of operations is greater if there are bankruptcies or closures of larger partners such as airlines, hotel chains, or large rental car companies. To the extent restaurants limit the availability of reservations through OpenTable or if a significant number of restaurants cease to participate in our services or if government restrictions limit occupant capacity of any travel service providers or restaurants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers may not continue to use our services and/or our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nKAYAK, a meta-search service, depends on access to information related to travel service pricing, schedules, availability, and other related information from OTCs and travel service providers to attract consumers. Many of KAYAK's agreements with OTCs and travel service providers are short-term agreements that may be terminated on 30 days' notice. To the extent OTCs or travel service providers no longer provide such information to KAYAK, KAYAK's ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumers could be diminished and its brand, business, and results of operations could be harmed. To the extent consumers do not view KAYAK as a reliable source of comprehensive travel service information, fewer consumers would likely visit its websites, which would also likely have a negative impact on KAYAK's advertising revenue and results of operations. In addition, if OTCs or travel service providers choose not to advertise with KAYAK or choose to reduce or eliminate the fees paid to KAYAK for referrals from query results, KAYAK's business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\n\nWe have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies and acquisitions of complementary businesses in furtherance of our mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. For example, we acquired Getaroom in December 2021 to enhance our business-to-business distribution capabilities for hotel partners and more effectively support our accommodations affiliate partners, and in November 2021 we entered into an agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management's attention from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, new risks with which we are not familiar, legal compliance obligations that previously did not apply to us, integration risks, and difficulties and unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions. As a result, entering new businesses involves risks and costs that could, if realized, have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, profit margins, cash flows or financial condition, as well as on our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any such investments or acquisitions.\n\nWe may decide to make minority investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have limited or no management or operational control. The controlling person in such a case may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and decisions of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or business or adversely affect the value of our investment.\n\nWe acquired a substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible assets in acquisitions. If we determine that any of our goodwill and intangible assets, or any goodwill or intangible assets acquired in future transactions experiences a decline in value we may be required to record an impairment, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we may issue shares of our common stock in these transactions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or combine internal businesses.\n\nThe integration of acquired businesses requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. In addition to acquired businesses, we have integrated certain of our businesses that had been managed",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, and the Section entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any forward-looking statements, which may be due to factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We connect consumers who wish to make travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. We also offer various other services to consumers and partners, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants.\n\nWe offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. We continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive services. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Reporting for information on our operating segments.\n\nThe results of our business outside of the U.S. consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda, and Rentalcars.com in their entirety and the parts of the KAYAK and OpenTable businesses located outside of the U.S. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services, or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com (which is domiciled in the Netherlands) at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the U.S. is part of the results of our businesses outside of the U.S. In 2021, the revenues from our businesses outside of the U.S. (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com through facilitating accommodation reservations) represented approximately 87% of our consolidated revenues. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.\n\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from advertising services, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and various other services, such as travelrelated insurance revenues.\n\n## Trends\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of travel restrictions by governments around the world resulted in a significant decline in travel activities and consumer demand for related services in 2020 in particular. Accommodation room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, declined rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic spread in the first quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the second quarter of 2020. Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and through 2021, accommodation room night declines versus the comparable period in 2019 have generally improved as government-imposed travel restrictions have eased, vaccines and other medical interventions have become more widespread, and consumer demand for travel has started to rebound. However, there have been periods of worsening trends due to spikes in COVID-19 cases and newly implemented travel restrictions, primarily related to new variants.",

      "question": "How does the impairment of goodwill related to OpenTable in 2020 reconcile with the continued emphasis on restaurant reservations as a key business metric in 2021, despite the lack of direct financial contribution to gross bookings?",
      "answer": "In 2020, OpenTable experienced significant goodwill impairments totaling $1.062 billion due to reduced near-term cash flow forecasts and a prolonged recovery timeline to 2019 profitability levels, primarily driven by a weakened outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservations. Despite this, in 2021, restaurant reservations through OpenTable were still highlighted as a core operating metric, indicating strategic importance despite not contributing directly to gross bookings. This suggests that while restaurant reservations were not a direct revenue driver, they remained a key engagement and traffic metric, supporting broader ecosystem value. The continued focus on restaurant reservations in 2021, despite prior impairments and lack of direct financial contribution, reflects a strategic decision to maintain OpenTable\u2019s platform relevance and user engagement.",

          "chunk_text": "A substantial portion of our intangible assets and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable, KAYAK, and Getaroom. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.\n\nWe review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment indicators were identified for our long-lived assets.\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches).\n\n## 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations.

      "answer": "BKNG's effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022, partly due to a decrease in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and lower international tax rates, although partially offset by a reduced benefit from the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax. The Innovation Box Tax rate increased from 7% to 9% effective January 1, 2021, and the Dutch statutory rate rose from 25% to 25.8% in 2022. Despite this, a portion of Booking.com's earnings still qualified for the Innovation Box Tax treatment, which significantly benefited BKNG\u2019s effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2023.

      "answer": "The issuance of Cruise Class G Preferred Shares in 2021 to Microsoft, Walmart, and other investors, including General Motors Holdings LLC for $1.0 billion, builds upon the capital structure established with the 2019 issuance of $1.2 billion in Cruise Class F Preferred Shares, of which $687 million was purchased by General Motors Holdings LLC. Both classes of preferred shares are structured to convert into common stock upon an IPO and are entitled to equal treatment in dividends and liquidation, indicating a consistent capital alignment strategy for Cruise Holdings. However, the Class G issuance significantly expanded the investor base and introduced strategic partners like Microsoft, which also became the preferred public cloud provider, suggesting a shift toward leveraging external strategic relationships to accelerate Cruise\u2019s commercialization goals. This evolution in capital structure and investor composition reflects GM\u2019s broader strategic intent to scale Cruise\u2019s autonomous vehicle initiatives through diversified, high-impact partnerships.",

      "answer": "The Netherlands Innovation Box Tax rate increased from 7% to 9% effective January 1, 2021, which is reflected in the company's effective tax rate for 2023. This lower rate applied to qualifying innovative activities by Booking.com and had a beneficial impact on the effective tax rate, although the benefit decreased compared to prior years. On page 49, the company notes that the 2023 effective tax rate was partially offset by a decrease in the Innovation Box Tax benefit. Meanwhile, page 105 shows that the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to international operations decreased from $29 million in 2022 to $30 million in 2023, indicating a relatively stable international tax position despite the rate change. The Dutch corporate income tax law, which governs the Innovation Box Tax, thus influences both the effective tax rate and the deferred tax asset valuation allowances, reflecting a nuanced interaction between tax incentives and tax asset risk.",

      "answer": "The $18.5 billion in outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (from page 85) is directly tied to NIKE\u2019s strategy to manage foreign currency risk associated with product cost exposures, including those generated through the NTC (page 84). The NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub, purchases NIKE-branded products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and then sells them to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure for the NTC when those entities have different functional currencies (from page 84 and page 46). This exposure is managed through NIKE\u2019s foreign currency adjustment program and the use of derivatives, including embedded derivatives and formally designated cash flow hedges (from page 85). The $18.5 billion hedge portfolio is intended to offset the variability in cash flows caused by these exposures, particularly those stemming from the NTC\u2019s intercompany sales and the fluctuating costs due to foreign exchange rates. This integrated approach reflects how NIKE uses financial instruments to stabilize the economic impact of currency fluctuations across its global supply chain structure.",

These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThe Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.\n\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $18.5 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, approximately $607 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2022, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $3 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\n\nAs part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $584 million.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 82",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period, hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. Additionally, the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company.\n\nThe purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs, non-functional currency denominated revenues, intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.\n\nProduct cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below.

      "answer": "NKE's use of the NTC (a wholly-owned sourcing hub) creates foreign currency exposure when it sells products to NIKE entities with different functional currencies. This exposure is compounded by the fact that NTC purchases products from third-party factories predominantly in U.S. Dollars. Simultaneously, NKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories, under which fluctuations in the basket of currencies affecting factory input costs create embedded derivative contracts. These contracts, totaling $584 million as of May 31, 2022, are recorded at fair value and recognized in Other (income) expense, net. However, some of these exposures are natural offsets to NKE's existing foreign currency exposures, suggesting that the company's risk management program is designed to internally balance these exposures before resorting to external hedging instruments. The $18.5 billion in outstanding foreign currency derivatives and the $607 million in deferred net gains expected to be reclassified into Net Income further indicate that NKE actively manages these exposures across its supply chain, aiming to stabilize inventory costs despite currency fluctuations.",

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThe Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.\n\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $18.5 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, approximately $607 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2022, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $3 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\n\nAs part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $584 million.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 82",

      "question": "How does the change in the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax rate and its application to Booking.com's earnings affect the company's effective tax rate in 2023 compared to 2022, and what does this reveal about the company's tax exposure under Dutch Corporate Income Tax Law?",
      "answer": "The Netherlands Innovation Box Tax rate increased from 7% to 9% for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and the Dutch statutory rate rose from 25% to 25.8% effective January 1, 2022. Booking.com's earnings qualified for this preferential tax treatment, significantly benefiting the company's effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2023. However, the effective tax rate for 2023 was lower than in 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses on equity securities, lower unrecognized tax benefits, and lower international tax rates, despite a reduced benefit from the Innovation Box Tax. This reveals that while the Innovation Box Tax continues to provide a meaningful benefit, its diminishing impact combined with broader changes in tax provisions and international tax rates influences the company's overall tax exposure under Dutch Corporate Income Tax Law.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BKNG(page_105) \u2192 Dutch Corporate Income Tax Law: The company's taxable earnings in the Netherlands are subject to Dutch corporate income tax law, under which a portion of Booking.com's earnings qualifies for the Innovation Box Tax rate of 9% (up from 7%) instead of the statutory rate of 25.8%.",
        "Hop 2: Dutch Corporate Income Tax Law \u2192 Netherlands Innovation Box Tax: Dutch corporate income tax law governs the Innovation Box Tax, which applies to income from qualifying innovative activities and has a beneficial impact on the company's effective tax rate, as noted in the reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate.",
        "Hop 3: Netherlands Innovation Box Tax \u2190 BKNG(page_49): The benefit from the Innovation Box Tax on the effective tax rate decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, contributing to a lower overall effective tax rate despite higher international tax rates and non-deductible fines."

Booking.com is the company's primary vehicle for delivering these services, offering accommodation reservation services for approximately 2.4 million properties globally (page_7). If Booking.com is required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland following an adverse outcome, it could directly impact BKNG's primary revenue stream. Given that accommodation reservations represent the vast majority of BKNG's revenue, even a localized regulatory change could have disproportionate financial consequences, especially if it sets a precedent for other jurisdictions.",

To the extent that these or any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nAs markets evolve and NCAs or other governmental authorities continue to monitor our industry, new investigations of the industry generally or of us specifically could and have occurred, including revisiting issues that were the subject of prior investigations. While we believe that we are complying with our commitments, investigating authorities or third parties may determine that we are not complying with the commitments we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedies. Further, in September 2017 the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland and the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland. We are cooperating with regulators where applicable, but we are unable to predict what, if any, effect any investigations or resolutions thereof, including the effect of any commitments we might make, will have on our business, industry practices, or online commerce more generally.\n\nTo the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on us or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding competition and/or consumer law investigations could adversely affect our brands and therefore our business, market share, and results of operations. Competition and consumer law-related investigations, legislation, or issues have and could in the future result in private litigation.\n\nAnother area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restrictions where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search terms related to the other party (e.g., such other party's name). Although we are generally moving away from these types of agreements, in some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to bidding restrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contracts, it could negatively impact our performance marketing efficiency, business, and results of operations.\n\nThere is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger. In some instances, countries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities than actions taken by NCAs or other regulatory authorities. France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety and, last year, a German court ruled that our narrow parity clauses are not permitted. Additionally, the EU's Platform to Business Regulation regulates the relationship between online platforms such as Booking.com and European business users of online platforms. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be \"gatekeepers.\" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not entirely known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to presume that we are a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act as currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption, we would be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For example, the rules applicable to gatekeepers could impose limitations on data collection and usage across services or with third parties, as well as on bundling services, and could require gatekeepers to share certain customer information with partners. Wide and possibly any type of parity clauses could be prohibited for gatekeeper platforms. Additionally, in July 2021 President Biden of the United States signed an executive order aimed at restricting anticompetitive practices, including those within the technology industry. Any rules or regulations that result from this executive order, as well as any other new laws and regulations and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our services, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise cause us to incur additional operating costs to comply with or address these developments. Further, as market conditions change as a result of investigations, litigation, legislation, or political or social pressure, we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practices beyond what is required, the full effects of which may not be known when making the decision, but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWith additional attention on the size of travel or technology companies generally, our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, our ability to expand into complementary businesses or our latitude in dealing with travel service providers (such as by limiting our ability to provide discounts, rebates, or incentives or to exercise contractual rights), any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or ability to grow and compete.",

We have made significant investments in people, technology, marketing, and expanded, new, or additional services, such as improving the selection of our extensive collection of accommodations including homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay, expanded flight and ground transportation offerings, payments, and other offerings. In 2021, we continued to scale our flight offerings to more markets, and offer payments solutions to more customers and partners. We continue to seek to maximize the benefits of our scale by sharing resources and technological innovations among our brands and co-developing new services. We also regularly evaluate, and may pursue and consummate, potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, or investments, whether to expand our businesses into complementary areas, expand our current businesses, acquire innovative technology, or for other reasons. For instance, in December 2021, we completed the acquisition of Getaroom, a business-to-business distributor of hotel rooms, which in conjunction with our Priceline business we expect to increase value for both hotel and affiliate partners, and in November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group.\n\n## Service Offerings\n\nBooking.com and Rentalcars.com.

          "chunk_text": "## Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting update to increase the transparency of government assistance including the disclosure of (1) the types of assistance, (2) an entity's accounting for the assistance, and (3) the effect of the assistance on an entity's financial statements. This update is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 21 for additional information on government assistance.\n\n## 3 . REVENUE\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenue\n\n## Revenue by Type of Service\n\nApproximately 87%, 88%, and 87% of the Company's revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, relates to online accommodation reservation services. Revenue from all other sources of online travel reservation services and advertising and other revenues each individually represent less than 10% of the Company's total revenues for each year.\n\n## Revenue by Geographic Area\n\nSee Note 18 for the information related to revenue by geographic area.\n\n## Deferred Merchant Bookings and Deferred Revenue\n\nCash payments received from travelers in advance of the Company completing its performance obligations are included in \"Deferred merchant bookings\" in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are comprised principally of amounts estimated to be payable to the travel service providers as well as the Company's estimated deferred revenue for its commission or margin and fees. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred merchant bookings included deferred revenue for online travel reservation services of $148 million and $50 million, respectively. The amounts are subject to refunds for cancellations. The Company expects to complete its performance obligations generally within one year from the reservation date. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenues of $35 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2021 is principally driven by payments received from travelers, net of amounts estimated to be payable to travel service providers, for online travel reservations in the current period.\n\n## Loyalty and Other Incentive Programs\n\nThe Company provides loyalty programs, such as OpenTable's loyalty program, where participating consumers are awarded loyalty points on current transactions that can be redeemed in the future. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, liabilities for loyalty program incentives of $13 million and $21 million, respectively, were included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of the loyalty points that are expected to be redeemed is recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the incentives are granted. In 2020, the Company recorded a decrease of $28 million to the liability, primarily due to changes in estimates of the number of loyalty points expected to be redeemed prior to expiration under OpenTable's loyalty program, with a corresponding increase to revenue.\n\nIn addition to the loyalty programs, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, liabilities of $58 million and $60 million, respectively, for other incentive programs, such as referral bonuses, rebates, credits, and discounts, including for Booking.com's back-to-travel campaigns, were included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2020, the Company offered additional rebates to customers meeting certain eligibility requirements under an incentive program at Booking.com. The eligibility requirements include the customer's enrollment in Booking.com's Genius Program (program features include special discounts offered by customers to frequent travelers) and Preferred Partner Program (program features include greater visibility for customers in search results for payment of higher commission) and timely payment of invoices. The additional rebates resulted in a reduction of revenue of $100 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and a liability of $25 million at December 31, 2020.",

      "question": "How does GM's financial exposure to nonconsolidated affiliates involved in car production compare with the strategic importance of cars in GM's overall product portfolio, particularly in light of the company's segment-based performance management approach?",
      "answer": "GM enters into transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates involved in the development, production, and marketing of cars, indicating a structural dependency on external entities for a key product category (page 78). While these affiliates supply component parts and vehicles, GM does not consolidate their financials, which may obscure the full financial impact of car production on GM\u2019s consolidated results. On the other hand, GM\u2019s segment reporting (page 101) shows that cars are strategically positioned not necessarily for individual profitability on a fully allocated cost basis, but to attract customers, maintain sales volumes for more profitable vehicles, and meet fuel efficiency standards. This suggests that while cars are integral to GM\u2019s strategic and operational goals, their production is partially outsourced to nonconsolidated affiliates, creating a financial exposure that is not fully reflected in segment-level performance metrics.",

        "Hop 3: Cars \u2190 GM(page_101): Cars are acknowledged as strategically important for showroom traffic and fuel efficiency compliance, but not individually profitable under GM\u2019s segment-based performance management."

However, Converse reported a 15% revenue decline on a currency-neutral basis, with gross margin contraction of approximately 130 basis points, partly due to lower full-price ASP and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. This suggests that while the broader NIKE Brand apparel segment remained strong, Converse struggled with both revenue and margin pressures, highlighting a divergence in performance between the two within the same category.",

      "answer": "NIKE manages foreign exchange risk related to product costs by hedging exposures generated through non-functional currency denominated purchases, including those made through the NIKE Trading Company (NTC). The NTC, which operates in U.S. Dollars, sources products from third-party factories and sells them to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure. A stronger U.S. Dollar increases inventory costs for these entities, while a weaker Dollar reduces them. NIKE mitigates this volatility using a combination of natural offsets and derivative instruments, such as currency forwards and options, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges. This layered approach helps stabilize inventory costs despite fluctuations in foreign exchange rates tied to NTC transactions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(page_84) \u2192 Product: NIKE purchases product, which is exposed to foreign exchange risk when denominated in non-functional currencies, and this exposure is managed through cash flow hedges.",
        "Hop 2: Product \u2192 NTC: The NTC sources NIKE-branded products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and sells them to NIKE entities in their local functional currencies, creating foreign exchange exposure.",
        "Hop 3: NTC \u2190 NKE(page_48): NIKE depends on the NTC for product sourcing, and this relationship results in foreign currency exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations, which directly affects inventory cost volatility."

KAYAK, which is described as a meta-search provider offering price-comparison tools across hundreds of travel platforms, plays a strategic role in BKNG\u2019s ecosystem. However, despite this operational interdependence, BKNG recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge related to KAYAK in 2020, indicating a significant decline in the expected future economic benefits from its investment in the brand.

Sojitz America, as the sole holder of Nike's redeemable preferred stock with a par value of $0.3 million, possesses specific class voting rights that allow it to influence major corporate decisions such as asset sales, mergers, liquidation, or the sale of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear in the U.S. This strategic influence is disproportionate to its economic stake, which is negligible relative to Nike's overall equity base.

      "question": "How does Nike's divestiture of entities in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile relate to its foreign exchange risk management strategy involving the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and its product sourcing model?",
      "answer": "Nike's divestiture of entities in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, with expected closure by the end of Q3 fiscal 2023, reflects a strategic shift in its APLA operating segment toward third-party distributors. This transition impacts how Nike manages foreign exchange risk, particularly in relation to product cost exposures. The NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a U.S. Dollar functional currency entity, sources products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and sells them to Nike entities in their respective functional currencies. This creates foreign currency exposure for local entities, which Nike mitigates through its foreign exchange risk management program, including cash flow hedges. With the divestiture of these entities, Nike will no longer internally manage these foreign exchange exposures in those regions, shifting this responsibility to third-party distributors. This aligns with Nike's broader strategy to streamline operations and reduce complexity in certain markets while maintaining global sourcing control through NTC.",

The impact of acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, was not considered material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, as a result of the Company's decision to transition its wholesale and direct to consumer operating model in certain countries within its APLA operating segment to third-party distributors, the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as held-for-sale within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into separate definitive agreements to sell its entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as its entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of these entities will remain classified as held-forsale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, held-for-sale assets were $182 million, primarily consisting of $73 million of Accounts receivable, net and $59 million of Inventories; held-for-sale liabilities were $58 million, primarily consisting of $26 million of Accrued liabilities and $20 million of Accounts payable.\n\nAs of May 31, 2021, held-for-sale assets were $175 million, primarily consisting of $76 million of Inventories and $59 million of Accounts receivable, net; held-for-sale liabilities were $72 million, primarily consisting of $25 million of Accounts payable and $22 million of Accrued liabilities.",

      "answer": "Nike manages foreign exchange risk related to product purchases through the NTC by using cash flow hedges, which are designed to offset the variability in cash flows caused by currency fluctuations. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, purchases products from third-party factories predominantly in U.S. Dollars and then sells them to Nike entities in their respective functional currencies. This creates a foreign currency exposure for the NTC when selling to Nike subsidiaries with different functional currencies. According to the transactional exposures section, this exposure is significant and is managed through a portfolio-based approach that includes natural offsets and the use of currency forward and option contracts. The hedging section explains that these contracts are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges, aligning with the need to stabilize the consolidated financial results against the volatility introduced by the functional currency mismatch between the NTC and other Nike entities.",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

      "question": "How does Nike's classification of accessories alongside athletic footwear and apparel relate to Converse's stand-alone reporting structure given its declining revenue performance?",
      "answer": "Nike classifies accessories as part of its broader product portfolio, which includes athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment, and treats them as a single performance obligation for revenue recognition purposes. This classification aligns accessories with Nike's core athletic offerings, which are managed across geographic segments. In contrast, Converse, which also produces accessories, is reported as a stand-alone segment with distinct financial performance. Converse's revenue declined from $2,427 million in 2023 to $2,082 million in 2024, while Nike's core brand revenues grew. This divergence suggests that Nike may be strategically distinguishing between its core athletic business and lifestyle brands like Converse, potentially signaling a shift in focus or resource allocation. The stand-alone reporting of Converse's declining performance, despite its production of similar product categories, highlights a nuanced approach to segment management and could indicate differing growth trajectories or strategic priorities for lifestyle versus performance-oriented brands.",

N IKE , Inc. portfolio brands include the N IKE  Brand, Jordan Brand and C onverse. T he N IKE  Brand is focused on perform ance athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services across M en's, W om en's and Kids', am plified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh tradem ark, as well as other N IKE  Brand tradem arks. T he Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jum pm an tradem ark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ents. C onverse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the C onverse, C huck Taylor, All Star, O ne Star, Star C hevron and Jack P urcell tradem arks. In som e m arkets outside the U .S., these tradem arks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, m arket and sell sim ilar products. O perating results of the C onverse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of N IKE , Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"C om pany\" or \"N IKE \"). All significant intercom pany transactions and balances have been elim inated.\n\n## MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statem ents in conform ity with generally accepted accounting principles requires m anagem ent to m ake estim ates, including estim ates relating to assum ptions that affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statem ents and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from  these estim ates.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of N IKE  Brand footwear, apparel and equipm ent, as well as C onverse products, com prise a single perform ance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to custom ers either through wholesale or direct to consum er channels. T he C om pany satisfies the perform ance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the custom er has occurred, based on the term s of sale. A custom er is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale custom ers upon shipm ent or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreem ent with the custom er. C ontrol transfers to retail store custom ers at the tim e of sale and to substantially all digital com m erce custom ers upon shipm ent. T he transaction price is determ ined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from  custom ers. P aym ent term s for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreem ent with the custom er and paym ent is generally required within 90 days or less of shipm ent to or receipt by the wholesale custom er. P aym ent is due at the tim e of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for tradem ark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangem ents, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governm ental authorities that are both im posed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the C om pany from  a custom er, are excluded from  R evenues and C ost of sales in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a custom er are accounted for as fulfillm ent costs and are included in C ost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration prom ised in the C om pany's contracts with custom ers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from custom ers. The C om pany estim ates the m ost likely am ount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against R evenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the tim e revenues are recognized. T he estim ated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 63",

G lobal Brand D ivisions costs represent dem and creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally m anaged for the N IKE  Brand, as well as costs associated with N IKE  D irect global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists prim arily of unallocated general and adm inistrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally m anaged departm ents; depreciation and am ortization related to the C om pany's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and com pensation program s, including stock-based com pensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.\n\nThe prim ary financial m easure used by the C om pany to evaluate perform ance of individual operating segm ents is earnings before interest and taxes (\"E BIT \"), which represents N et incom e before Interest expense (incom e), net and Incom e tax expense in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\nAs part of the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program , standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each N IKE  Brand entity in the C om pany's geographic operating segm ents and to C onverse. These rates are set approxim ately nine and twelve m onths in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and sum m er selling seasons) based on average m arket spot rates in the calendar m onth preceding the date they are established. Inventories and C ost of sales for geographic operating segm ents and C onverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. D ifferences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual m arket rates are included in C orporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from  the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and P roperty, plant and equipm ent, net for operating segm ents are regularly reviewed by m anagem ent and are therefore provided below.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 86",

      "question": "Given Converse's 15% revenue decline in fiscal 2024 and its explicit role as a reportable segment focused on athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, how does NIKE's strategic emphasis on growing its accessories business through NIKE Direct and wholesale channels reconcile with Converse's underperformance in these areas?",
      "answer": "Converse, as a reportable segment focused on athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, experienced a 15% revenue decline in fiscal 2024, driven by drops in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. Meanwhile, NIKE's overall strategy emphasizes growing its accessories business through both NIKE Direct and wholesale partnerships, as stated in the MD&A section. This raises a critical alignment issue: despite NIKE's strategic push to expand accessories through these channels, Converse\u2014its key vehicle for accessories\u2014underperformed, with direct-to-consumer revenues down 14% and wholesale down 16%. The contradiction suggests potential challenges in Converse\u2019s brand positioning, product mix, or execution within those channels, which could impact NIKE\u2019s broader accessories growth objectives.",

      "question": "How does Starbucks' deferred revenue arrangement with Nestl\u00e9 for the Global Coffee Alliance align with the company's stated risks regarding supply chain dependencies on key business partners?",
      "answer": "Starbucks reports a significant financial dependency on Nestl\u00e9 through the Global Coffee Alliance, as evidenced by the upfront prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9 recorded in deferred revenue (page 66). This relationship is central to the Channel Development segment, which relies on Nestl\u00e9 to distribute packaged goods and foodservice products globally (page 88). However, the company explicitly states that if Nestl\u00e9 fails to meet its distribution and marketing commitments, it could 'have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results' (page 22). Thus, while the deferred revenue arrangement provides upfront financial benefit, it is inextricably tied to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s performance, exposing Starbucks to supply chain and brand execution risks that are acknowledged in the risk factors section.",

While we are closely monitoring the operational and financial impacts of labor union organizing efforts on our business, as of the date of this filing, we believe the risk of a material contingent loss associated with these litigation matters is remote.\n\n## Note 17:    Segment Reporting\n\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our ceo, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, manages the segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions.\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development.\n\nNorth America and International operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single-serve coffee products, and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale.\n\nChannel Development revenues include packaged coffee, tea, foodservice products, and ready-to-drink beverage sales to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores.

An inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the performance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to ex pand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail licensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

      "question": "How does Tesla's issuance of 2,894,424 shares to 2019 Warrantholders in Q4 2024 impact the diluted net income per share calculation that includes 8 million shares from warrants in the earnings per share reconciliation?",
      "answer": "Tesla issued 2,894,424 shares to the 2019 Warrantholders during October 2024 as part of warrant exercises tied to the 2019 convertible notes offering. Despite this significant issuance, the diluted net income per share calculation for 2024 only includes 8 million shares from warrants, a reduction from 11 million in 2023. This suggests that while the actual share issuance increased equity dilution, the accounting treatment or timing of the warrant exercises may have limited their full impact on the diluted EPS calculation, potentially due to anti-dilutive provisions or the method of inclusion in the weighted average shares calculation.",

      "answer": "GM has committed over $35 billion from 2020 through 2025 to invest in EV and AV technologies, with a key part of this strategy being the development and profitable sale of electric trucks. However, the company faces risks related to the timely and successful introduction of new vehicle models, especially EVs, which require significant capital investment and depend on complex technological development. Compounding this strategic risk, GM has financial exposure to nonconsolidated affiliates who are actively involved in the development, production, and marketing of trucks and related components. These affiliates are integral to GM\u2019s supply chain and vehicle production ecosystem, yet their nonconsolidated status suggests GM does not fully control their operations or financial outcomes. This creates execution risk for GM\u2019s EV strategy, as disruptions or inefficiencies in these affiliate relationships could delay or compromise the development and production of key truck models central to its long-term profitability and strategic direction.",

Risk Factors\n\nWe  have  listed  below  the  most  material  risk  factors  applicable  to  us.  These  risk  factors  are  not  necessarily  in  the  order  of importance or probability of occurrence:\n\n## Risks related to our competition and strategy\n\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will  continue  to  experience  significant  change  in  the  coming  years,  particularly  as  traditional  automotive  original  equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the  entrance  of  start-ups  and  other  non-traditional  competitors  in  the  automotive  industry.  These  new  competitors,  as  well  as established  industry  participants,  are  disrupting  the  historic  business  model  of  our  industry  through  the  introduction  of  new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer  sales channels, methods  of  transportation  and  vehicle  ownership.  To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that  are  outside  of  our  historically  core  ICE  business,  such  as  EVs  and A Vs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.\n\nOur vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any constraints  on  lending  due  to  concerns  about  climate  change,  our  ability  to  execute  on  our  strategic  plans  could  be  adversely affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\n\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\n\nOur ability  to  maintain  profitability  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  timely  fund  and  introduce  new  and  improved  vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with market  participants  routinely  introducing  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  and  features  designed  to  meet  rapidly  evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility  to  adjust  personnel  costs  to  changes  in  demands  for  our  products,  may  further  exacerbate  the  risks  associated  with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\n\nOur  long-term  strategy  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  profitably  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  EVs. The  production  and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future.  In  2021,  we  increased  our  commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV strategy  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  high-quality  EVs  that  are  competitive  and  meet  consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.",

      "answer": "The Netherlands Innovation Box Tax benefit decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, contributing to a higher effective tax rate in 2023 despite a lower valuation allowance and lower international tax rates. This Innovation Box Tax, part of Dutch corporate income tax law, allows qualifying innovative activities\u2014such as those by Booking.com\u2014to be taxed at 9% instead of the standard 25.8%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings in both 2022 and 2023 qualified for this reduced rate, significantly benefiting the company\u2019s effective tax rate. However, the Innovation Box Tax benefit declined in 2023, which partially offset the otherwise lower effective tax rate. This context aligns with the broader international tax structure BKNG operates under, as noted in the reconciliation section, which highlights the significance of Dutch tax law on the company\u2019s international earnings and deferred tax assets, including a $675 million deferred tax asset in 2023.",

Despite this operational distinction, BKNG continues to maintain ownership of OpenTable even after recording a substantial $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge related to the platform in 2020.

This consistent treatment\u2014delivering dividend equivalents in stock rather than cash\u2014reveals a company-wide equity compensation philosophy aimed at aligning long-term incentives with shareholder value creation by increasing equity stake rather than providing immediate cash returns.

At the grant date of the award, recipients of restricted stock are granted voting rights and generally receive dividends on unvested shares, paid in the form of cash on each dividend payment date. Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019. Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.\n\nWe have also granted performance share awards under the Plans. These awards provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock at the end of the three-year performance cycle based upon our performance against target average ROIC and operating profit over that performance cycle. Additionally, the awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance share awards have no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned.\n\nThe fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\n\nRestricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after the grant date. Additionally, the majority of these awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.

Specifically, the filing notes that a failure by Nestl\u00e9 to support, protect, and grow the Starbucks brand in Channel Development could limit Starbucks\u2019 ability to grow this business, potentially affecting revenue stability and long-term brand equity. Thus, the $2.95 billion revenue contribution from this segment is directly exposed to the performance and reliability of Nestl\u00e9 under their agreement.",

Unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2024 were as follows: North America (75%), International (20%), and Channel Development (5%).\n\nOur North America and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are in various stages of development and may require more extensive support, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our North America operations.\n\nOur Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Starbucks-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino and Starbucks Doubleshot , foodservice products, and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of our Channel Development business operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9, while our global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba, Nestl\u00e9, and others. \u00ae \u00ae",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- import or other business licensing requirements.\n\nMoreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing markets, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. An inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the performance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to ex pand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail licensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

This apparent duality reflects a strategic reliance on both internal manufacturing capabilities and external partnerships, particularly in international markets where nonconsolidated affiliates\u2014such as those in China\u2014develop, produce, and market vehicles and parts under shared brand names like Buick and Chevrolet. GM enters into purchase and sale agreements with these affiliates, integrating them into its broader supply chain while maintaining control over branding, distribution, and strategic direction.

          "chunk_text": "A substantial portion of our intangible assets and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable, KAYAK, and Getaroom. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.\n\nWe review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment indicators were identified for our long-lived assets.\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches).\n\n## 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations.

The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered the online travel market and grown rapidly by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through flight, hotel, and alternative accommodations meta-search products (\"Google Flights\", \"Google Hotel Ads\", and \"Google Vacation Rentals\"), its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality, \"Google Travel\" (a planning tool that aggregates its flight, hotel, and packages products), and integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into Google Maps. In particular, Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights have grown rapidly and achieved significant market share in a relatively short time. As the economy and the travel industry recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the structure of the travel industry or consumer preferences could change in ways that could disadvantage us and benefit certain of our existing competitors or new entrants. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting international travel restrictions and social distancing practices, we saw a shift in favor of domestic travel and alternative accommodations. This shift could benefit competitors that are more well established in domestic markets and alternative accommodations than we are. As a result, our historical strengths may not provide the competitive advantages that they did prior to the pandemic. If we are unable to successfully adapt to any changes in how the travel industry operates or to changes in the ways in which consumers purchase travel services, our ability to compete, and therefore our business and results of operations, would be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with companies that provide a variety of products and services, including:\n\n- online travel reservation services;\n- online accommodation search and/or reservation services that are focused primarily on alternative accommodations;\n- large online companies, including search, social networking and marketplace companies;\n- traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers and tour operators, many of which combine physical locations, telephone services, and online services;\n- travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines) that have their own branded online platforms to which they drive business;\n- online travel meta-search and price comparison services;\n- \"Super apps\" that offer consumers a wide range of everyday and other services including travel bookings;\n- companies offering new rental car business models or car- or ride-sharing services that affect demand for rental cars, some of which have developed innovative technologies to improve efficiency of point-to-point transportation and extensively utilize mobile platforms;\n- online restaurant reservation services; and\n- companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers, including large global distribution systems (\"GDSs\") and hospitality software platforms.\n\nMeta-search services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service providers, online travel companies (\"OTCs\"), and other online platforms and in many instances compete directly with us for customers. Google leverages its general search business to promote its meta-search offerings by showing meta-search results at the top of its organic search results. Google and other meta-search services may evolve into more traditional OTCs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly through their platforms. If consumers book travel services through a service such as TripAdvisor's \"Instant Booking,\" Google's \"Book on Google,\" or directly with a travel service provider without using an OTC like us, or if meta-search services limit our participation within",

Despite this, Nike's balance sheet shows no redeemable preferred stock liabilities, indicating that no dividends are currently in arrears. This preferred stock ownership also affects Nike's equity structure by granting Sojitz America specific voting rights on major corporate actions such as asset sales, mergers, or liquidation, while not having general voting rights.

      "answer": "Booking.com's $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge for OpenTable (page 66) reflects a significant financial setback tied to its stake in the online restaurant reservation platform. This impairment charge implies that the expected future economic benefits from OpenTable did not materialize as anticipated. In the competitive landscape analysis (page 17), the company notes that it competes with various online restaurant reservation services, and that intense competition could reduce its market share and harm its financial performance. Given that OpenTable operates in the same online restaurant reservation market, the impairment may be indicative of the pressures described in the risk factors, such as the ability of larger competitors with more resources to dominate the space or shifts in consumer behavior that disadvantage Booking.com's position. The connection between the competitive risks and the financial impairment highlights the real impact of market pressures on strategic investments.",

          "chunk_text": "for our services, and relationships with travel service providers and other partners, any of which can adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nIntense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\n\nWe compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered the online travel market and grown rapidly by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through flight, hotel, and alternative accommodations meta-search products (\"Google Flights\", \"Google Hotel Ads\", and \"Google Vacation Rentals\"), its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality, \"Google Travel\" (a planning tool that aggregates its flight, hotel, and packages products), and integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into Google Maps. In particular, Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights have grown rapidly and achieved significant market share in a relatively short time. As the economy and the travel industry recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the structure of the travel industry or consumer preferences could change in ways that could disadvantage us and benefit certain of our existing competitors or new entrants. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting international travel restrictions and social distancing practices, we saw a shift in favor of domestic travel and alternative accommodations. This shift could benefit competitors that are more well established in domestic markets and alternative accommodations than we are. As a result, our historical strengths may not provide the competitive advantages that they did prior to the pandemic. If we are unable to successfully adapt to any changes in how the travel industry operates or to changes in the ways in which consumers purchase travel services, our ability to compete, and therefore our business and results of operations, would be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with companies that provide a variety of products and services, including:\n\n- online travel reservation services;\n- online accommodation search and/or reservation services that are focused primarily on alternative accommodations;\n- large online companies, including search, social networking and marketplace companies;\n- traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers and tour operators, many of which combine physical locations, telephone services, and online services;\n- travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines) that have their own branded online platforms to which they drive business;\n- online travel meta-search and price comparison services;\n- \"Super apps\" that offer consumers a wide range of everyday and other services including travel bookings;\n- companies offering new rental car business models or car- or ride-sharing services that affect demand for rental cars, some of which have developed innovative technologies to improve efficiency of point-to-point transportation and extensively utilize mobile platforms;\n- online restaurant reservation services; and\n- companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers, including large global distribution systems (\"GDSs\") and hospitality software platforms.\n\nMeta-search services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service providers, online travel companies (\"OTCs\"), and other online platforms and in many instances compete directly with us for customers. Google leverages its general search business to promote its meta-search offerings by showing meta-search results at the top of its organic search results. Google and other meta-search services may evolve into more traditional OTCs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly through their platforms. If consumers book travel services through a service such as TripAdvisor's \"Instant Booking,\" Google's \"Book on Google,\" or directly with a travel service provider without using an OTC like us, or if meta-search services limit our participation within",
