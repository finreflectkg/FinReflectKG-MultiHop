      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's current production growth of 111 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day reconcile with its planned acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which adds over 700 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day in production capacity?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil reported a net production growth of 111 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2023, excluding divestments and entitlements. The acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, expected to close in Q2 2024, adds over 700 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day of production capacity as of Q3 2023. This suggests that the Pioneer acquisition significantly accelerates ExxonMobil's production scale, potentially increasing its daily output by more than sixfold compared to its organic growth in 2023.",

APLNG is a key vehicle for COP\u2019s exposure to CBM production in Queensland, Australia. Despite this impairment, COP continues to hold a 37.5% stake in APLNG, underscoring its strategic commitment to CBM and LNG exports. However, the impairment suggests that COP recognized significant risks in the CBM asset class, potentially tied to commodity pricing, regulatory conditions, or long-term demand trends.

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities.

The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

This dependency is partially satisfied through its 30% equity stake in QatarEnergy LNG, which produced 13 MBD (thousand barrels per day) of crude oil in 2023. This means COP\u2019s net crude oil production from QatarEnergy LNG contributes directly to its resource needs, aligning with its broader reliance on crude oil as a core input.

This plant is a key part of COP\u2019s monetization strategy in Equatorial Guinea, where condensate revenue is realized through market-priced sales. In contrast, in Norway, condensate is produced from the Aasta Hansteen Field and transported via shuttle tankers to market, representing a more direct and logistically mature revenue stream. While the Alba Plant LLC involvement is structured through equity earnings and contingent liabilities, the Norwegian operations reflect a more integrated and controlled production and export system. This suggests that the Alba-related exposure carries both higher financial guarantee risk and more complex revenue dynamics compared to the more straightforward condensate production and logistics in Norway.",

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

With the acquisition, we have increased our global operations adding oil, natural gas and LNG activity in Equatorial Guinea to our portfolio. See Note 3.\n\nWe have varying stages of oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in Equatorial Guinea. We operate in both the Alba and Block D PSCs that form the Alba Unit located offshore Equatorial Guinea.\n\n## Gas Processing\n\nThe following facilities located on Bioko Island allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba Unit and are accounted for as equity method i nvestments and are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.\n\nWe own a 52.2 percent interest in the Alba Plant LLC, our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (27.8 percent) and Sociedad Nacional de Gas de Guinea Ecuatorial (SONAGAS) (20.0 percent), which operates an onshore liquified petroleum gas (LPG) processing plant. Alba Plant LLC processes Alba Unit natural gas under a fixed-rate long-term contract. The LPG processing plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and sells it at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement. Processed natural gas is delivered to Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (EG LNG) for liquefaction and storage. We market our share of LNG to third parties indexed at global LNG prices.\n\nWe own a 56.0 percent interest in EG LNG, our joint venture with SONAGAS (37.9 percent) and Marubeni Gas Development UK Limited (6.1 percent), which operates a 3.7 MTPA LNG production facility. In January 2024, we began a five-year LNG sales agreement for a portion of our equity gas from the Alba Unit, providing us with additional exposure to the European LNG market.\n\nWe own a 45.0 percent interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (AMPCO), our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (45.0 percent) and SONAGAS (10.0 percent), which operates a methanol plant. The plant is currently offline.\n\nAdditionally, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen Field under a combination of tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangements which are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips highlights APLNG\u2019s LNG export capabilities as a strategic asset, particularly in accessing Asia Pacific markets through long-term agreements and its operated LNG facility in Queensland, Australia. However, despite this strategic positioning, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $688 million in 2021 when it exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% stake in APLNG. This charge arose because the fair value of APLNG, determined via an observable market transaction, was below the carrying value of ConocoPhillips' existing investment. This discrepancy suggests that while APLNG remains strategically valuable for LNG exports, its market valuation at the time indicated lower financial performance expectations, leading to the write-down.",

      "answer": "COP's investment in PALNG, which included interest rate swaps designated under ASC Topic 815, reflects its involvement in complex derivative instruments for risk management. However, when PALNG de-designated part of these swaps in 2024, the associated $35 million in unrealized changes flowed through 'Equity in earnings of affiliates,' indicating a shift in how those derivatives are accounted for. Meanwhile, COP applies ASC Topic 815 to certain physical gas contracts that fall outside ASC Topic 606, treating them as derivatives for revenue recognition. This suggests that while COP uses ASC Topic 815 both for hedging investments (like in PALNG) and for revenue from commodity contracts, the financial impact is recognized differently\u2014either through equity earnings or directly as revenue\u2014depending on the nature and context of the derivative.",

Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.

Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.

This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business unit's reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.\n\nDuring 2024, our processes and controls used to assess over 85 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2024, were reviewed by D&amp;M. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2024 proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master's degree in reservoir engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 20 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n138",

In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2024 proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master's degree in reservoir engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 20 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n138",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips holds a 37.5% equity investment in APLNG, which operates coal bed methane (CBM) production in Queensland, Australia, and processes and exports LNG under long-term sales agreements. In 2021, Origin Energy sold 10% of its stake in APLNG, and ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to acquire this additional interest. However, the fair value of APLNG based on this transaction was lower than the carrying value of ConocoPhillips' existing investment, leading to a noncash impairment charge of $688 million. This impairment reduced the carrying value of the investment to $5,574 million as of December 31, 2021. Despite APLNG's long-term contracts and access to CBM resources, the impairment reflects a market-driven valuation adjustment, indicating a strategic reassessment of the asset's value under current economic conditions.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips applies ASC Topic 815 to account for physical gas contracts at market prices, treating them as derivatives without electing the normal purchases and sales exception. This aligns with the broader use of derivative instruments across its joint ventures, such as PALNG, which also uses ASC Topic 815 for interest rate swaps to manage financing risk. In 2024, PALNG recognized a $56 million unrealized loss in other comprehensive income and $35 million in equity in earnings related to these swaps, indicating active hedging.

          "chunk_text": "## Interest Rate Derivative Instruments\n\nIn 2023, PALNG executed interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting 60 percent of the projected term loans outstanding to finance the cost of development and construction of Phase 1 from floating to fixed rate. These swaps were designated and qualified for hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815, 'Derivatives and Hedging,' as a cash flow hedge with changes in the fair value of the designated hedging instruments reported as a component of other comprehensive income and to be reclassified into earnings in the same periods that the hedged transactions will affect earnings.\n\nIn 2024, PALNG de-designated a portion of the interest rate swaps as a cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value of the de-designated hedging instruments are reported in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line on our consolidated income statement.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, we recognized an unrealized loss of $56 million and an unrealized gain of $78 million in other comprehensive income, respectively, related to the hedge accounted swaps. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $35 million in \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" related to the de-designated swaps.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nWe invest in financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various accounts and currency pools we manage. The types of financial i nstruments in which we currently invest include:\n\n- Time deposits: Interest bearing deposits placed with financial institutions for a predetermined amount of time.\n- Demand deposits: Interest bearing deposits placed with financial institutions. Deposited funds can be withdrawn without notice.\n- Commercial paper: Unsecured promissory notes issued by a corporation, commercial bank or government agency purchased at a discount to mature at par.\n- U.S. government or government agency obligations: Securities issued by the U.S. government or U.S. government agencies.\n- Foreign government obligations: Securities issued by foreign governments.\n- Corporate bonds: Unsecured debt securities issued by corporations.\n- Asset-backed securities: Collateralized debt securities.\n\nThe following investments are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at cost, plus accrued interest and the table reflects remaining maturities at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

      "answer": "Chevron reported a net decrease of 107 million BOE in proved undeveloped reserves at TCO in Kazakhstan due to performance-driven reservoir model changes. TCO, which produces crude oil from the Tengiz and Korolev fields, is a key contributor to Chevron\u2019s overall crude oil reserves and production. In the consolidated reserves table, Chevron reported 1,295 million BOE in crude oil reserves from affiliated companies, including TCO, at the end of 2023. This indicates that despite the TCO reserve revision, Chevron's overall crude oil reserves from affiliated companies remained relatively stable, suggesting offsetting reserve additions elsewhere.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reported an average net production of 8 MBD of crude oil in 2021, with an average sales price of $56.38 per barrel. Through its 30% interest in Qatargas Operating Company Limited, the company received 13 MBD of crude oil production from the QG3 field. This indicates that QG3 alone contributed more crude oil volume than the company\u2019s total net production, highlighting its outsized importance in the production mix despite being one of many assets. The qualitative implication is that QG3 plays a pivotal role in COP's upstream crude oil portfolio, even though it is not fully owned.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% stake in APLNG in 2021, based on a sale price that reflected a market participant valuation of APLNG which was lower than ConocoPhillips' carrying value. As a result, the company was required to write down its investment in APLNG to the fair value of $5,574 million, leading to a before-tax charge of $688 million. This write-down indicates that the fair value of APLNG, as determined by the transaction price from Origin Energy\u2019s sale, was significantly lower than ConocoPhillips\u2019 previous carrying value, highlighting a valuation impairment driven by market conditions and expectations at the time.",

      "answer": "Chevron holds a 50% working interest in Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC, which operates soybean oil processing facilities in Destrehan, Louisiana. This soybean oil serves as a renewable feedstock for fuels like renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, aligning with Chevron\u2019s broader renewable fuels strategy that includes 11 biofuel refineries globally. However, in Louisiana, Chevron faces 39 lawsuits from coastal parishes alleging environmental damage from historical oil and gas operations, with one case set for trial in October 2024. These legal risks, which the company acknowledges could have a material adverse effect, are geographically co-located with its current renewable feedstock operations. This juxtaposition highlights a strategic tension: while Chevron is expanding its renewable energy footprint in Louisiana through Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC, it also faces significant legacy liabilities in the same region, potentially complicating its long-term operational and investment plans in the state.",

      "answer": "Chevron's acquisition of Hess Corporation, valued at $53 billion, is subject to regulatory scrutiny under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act. As part of the compliance process, Chevron and Hess worked with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to address antitrust concerns, culminating in a consent agreement that allowed the merger to proceed under certain conditions. However, despite HSR compliance efforts, the transaction remains delayed due to an unrelated arbitration over the Stabroek Block operating agreement, with a decision expected in Q3 2025.

This condensate production is part of COP\u2019s broader upstream operations.

The company has financial exposure tied to Alba Plant LLC through guarantees, including a $116 million maximum potential future payment obligation related to agreements to process third-party gas. Therefore, while condensate from Aasta Hansteen contributes to COP\u2019s direct hydrocarbon production and revenue, the company also faces contingent liabilities through its ownership in Alba Plant LLC, which processes both Alba Unit and third-party gas, linking upstream production with downstream financial risk.",

If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How does Chevron's investment in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium relate to its crude oil production growth from Tengizchevroil, and how might this dependency impact Chevron's upstream performance given crude oil's strategic role in the company's operations?",
      "answer": "Chevron's $4,500 million loan to Tengizchevroil (TCO) through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which Chevron holds a 15% interest, plays a critical role in transporting the 260,000 barrels per day of incremental crude oil production expected from TCO's Future Growth Project (FGP). Since most of TCO\u2019s 2024 crude oil production was exported via the CPC pipeline, Chevron's upstream performance and ability to realize growth in oil-equivalent production depends heavily on the continued operation and capacity of this transportation infrastructure. This dependency on CPC underscores a strategic risk, especially as crude oil remains central to Chevron's upstream earnings and asset base.",

      "answer": "Chevron's upstream operations in Kazakhstan, particularly the Tengizchevroil (TCO) affiliate, rely heavily on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) for crude oil exports, as noted on page 35. In 2024, most of TCO's crude oil production was exported through the CPC pipeline. This dependency is further contextualized by the completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP), which added 260,000 barrels per day of crude oil production capacity. Given this increased throughput, Chevron's 15% ownership stake in CPC, disclosed on page 85, becomes strategically significant as CPC transports an average of 1.4 million barrels per day of crude oil, including Chevron's share from TCO and Karachaganak. The alignment suggests that Chevron's investment in CPC is critical to supporting the increased production volumes from its upstream growth projects in Kazakhstan, reinforcing the importance of midstream infrastructure to upstream monetization strategies.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% interest in APLNG in December 2021, despite the carrying value of its existing investment being written down to $5,574 million due to fair value considerations. APLNG, a joint venture focused on producing coal bed methane (CBM) from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, operates under significant project financing obligations, with $4.7 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2023. This financing includes a non-recourse facility structured through the Export-Import Bank of the United States, commercial banks, and U.S. Private Placement note facilities. Despite the financial burden of these obligations, COP\u2019s strategic move to increase its stake in APLNG underscores its commitment to expanding its CBM production footprint in Australia, aligning with its broader LNG export strategy targeting Asia Pacific markets.",

However, this strategic position comes with significant financial exposure, including a $610 million potential liability (up to $1.0 billion in case of intentional or reckless breach) tied to APLNG's natural gas delivery commitments. Despite these risks, COP continues to highlight APLNG's CBM production as central to its LNG export capabilities, particularly to Asia Pacific markets. The company's $5.0 billion carrying value in APLNG as of December 31, 2024, suggests confidence in the long-term value of the CBM resource despite the contingent liabilities, indicating a strategic trade-off between risk and reward in its LNG portfolio positioning.",

Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How does Chevron's financial exposure to Tengizchevroil, including its $4,500 loan for the FGP/WPMP development, intersect with its ongoing tax uncertainties in Kazakhstan, particularly given that the most recent finalized tax audit in that country was for the year 2012?",
      "answer": "Chevron's financial exposure to Tengizchevroil, where it holds a 50% equity stake and has extended a $4,500 loan to fund the FGP/WPMP development, indicates a significant operational and financial commitment to Kazakhstan. This is further contextualized by the fact that Tengizchevroil contributed to improved equity affiliate income in 2021, highlighting its strategic importance. However, Chevron also faces ongoing tax uncertainties in Kazakhstan, where the most recent finalized tax audit was for 2012, leaving over a decade of potential exposure unresolved. Given Chevron's deep operational involvement through Tengizchevroil and the magnitude of its financial commitments, the lack of recent tax audit closure in Kazakhstan raises material risk regarding potential adjustments to Chevron\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits, which could significantly impact its effective tax rate if recognized.",

At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\n\nPetroboscan Chevron  has  a  39.2  percent  interest  in  Petroboscan,  a  joint  stock  company  which  operates  the  Boscan  Field  in Venezuela.  In  2020,  the  company  fully  impaired  its  investments  in  the  Petroboscan  affiliate  and,  effective  July  1,  2020,  began accounting  for  this  venture  as  a  non-equity  method  investment.  The  company  also  has  an  outstanding  long-term  loan  to Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola  LNG Limited Chevron  has  a  36.4  percent  interest  in Angola  LNG  Limited,  which  processes  and  liquefies  natural  gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.

Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.\n\nTax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company's major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2021.

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips recorded a $688 million pre-tax charge in 2021 when it exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% stake in APLNG, reflecting a fair value assessment that was below the carrying value of the existing investment. This write-down indicates a significant downward adjustment in the perceived value of APLNG at that time. Despite this financial impairment, APLNG remains a core asset in ConocoPhillips' portfolio, focused on producing coal bed methane (CBM) from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, with plans for approximately 3,500 net wells to supply both LNG export contracts and the domestic gas market. The long-term production outlook for CBM appears optimistic in operational and strategic sections, suggesting a strategic bet on future CBM production growth to justify continued investment despite the earlier financial loss. This juxtaposition highlights a tension between short-term valuation adjustments and long-term resource development expectations.",

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' engagement of DeGolyer and MacNaughton to review reserves estimation processes, as disclosed in Exhibit 99, align with the company's internal controls over reserves reporting and the qualifications of the individual overseeing those controls?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips engages DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, to annually review the company's reserves estimation processes for over 85% of proved reserves as of December 31, 2024, ensuring alignment with SEC regulations. This external review is part of a broader internal control framework led by the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting, a reservoir engineering expert with over 20 years of industry experience. The internal team, which includes D&M's senior representative, conducts on-site visits, teleconferences, and documentation reviews to ensure consistency and adherence to both company policy and SEC guidelines. This structured oversight mechanism, combining internal expertise and independent third-party validation, reinforces the integrity of reserves reporting despite the inherent imprecision in reserves estimation.",

Meanwhile, Chevron's upstream earnings from Tengizchevroil (TCO) in Kazakhstan improved in 2021, contributing positively to equity affiliate income. However, Chevron has also extended a significant $4,500 loan to TCO to fund development projects like the FGP/WPMP, which is included in Chevron\u2019s carrying value of its investment. This suggests that while Chevron benefits from TCO's operational performance, it also faces material financial exposure through both tax liabilities and direct financial support in a jurisdiction with unresolved tax audits, potentially impacting both earnings and cash flow stability.",

For the company's major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\n\nPetroboscan Chevron  has  a  39.2  percent  interest  in  Petroboscan,  a  joint  stock  company  which  operates  the  Boscan  Field  in Venezuela.  In  2020,  the  company  fully  impaired  its  investments  in  the  Petroboscan  affiliate  and,  effective  July  1,  2020,  began accounting  for  this  venture  as  a  non-equity  method  investment.  The  company  also  has  an  outstanding  long-term  loan  to Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola  LNG Limited Chevron  has  a  36.4  percent  interest  in Angola  LNG  Limited,  which  processes  and  liquefies  natural  gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea.

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' capital allocation strategy, as outlined in its disciplined investment framework, reconcile with its decision to exercise a preemptive right to acquire an additional 10% stake in APLNG at a valuation below carrying value, especially in light of the subsequent impairment charge recorded on its existing investment?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips emphasizes a disciplined investment framework focused on capital efficiency, cost control, and value maximization over production growth, particularly in commodity-driven cycles (page 40). Despite this, the company exercised its preemptive right to acquire an additional 10% in APLNG at a market-determined fair value below its carrying value, which led to a $688 million noncash impairment charge (page 119). This decision appears to be based on long-term strategic value expectations from APLNG\u2019s LNG position and CBM resources in Australia, even though the investment was impaired due to a decline in fair value. The contrast between the capital discipline framework and the APLNG acquisition suggests a strategic bet on LNG growth potential in Asia Pacific markets, despite short-term valuation concerns.",

          "chunk_text": "- Disciplined investments. Our goal is to achieve strong  free cash flow by exercising capital  discipline, controlling our costs, and safely  and reliably delivering production.  We expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the price cycles.  Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return  to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest  back into the business for future cash flow expansion  .\n- o Exercise capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow.  As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities.  We allocate capital  across a geographically diverse,  low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline.  Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis.  Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and G&amp;A.  In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake.  Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders.\n- o Control our costs. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority.  Using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly  in a low commodity price environment.  The ability to control our operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.\n- o Optimize our portfolio. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho and Shell's Permian assets, significantly increasing our unconventional portfolio with many additional years of low cost of supply inventory.  The addition of this highly complementary acreage in the Midland and Delaware basins created a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48.  In our Asia Pacific segment, we notified Origin Energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG and announced the sale of our interests in Indonesia. See Note 3 .\n\nWe continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that don't compete.  As such, in conjunction with our Shell Permian acquisition announcement, we communicated an increase in our planned disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023 as part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts.\n\n- o Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:\n- \u25fe Acquire interest in existing  or new fields.\n- \u25fe Apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.\n- \u25fe Successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.\n\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.  This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% stake in APLNG in December 2021, which led to a write-down of its investment to $5,574 million due to fair value being below carrying value. This decision reflects ConocoPhillips' strategic commitment to APLNG despite short-term financial impairments. APLNG, a joint venture with Origin Energy and Sinopec, operates under a $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse in 2017, with $4.7 billion still outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

      "answer": "Chevron's crude oil reserve growth in Kazakhstan, particularly from the Tengiz and Korolev fields, is expected to be supported by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's (CPC) increased throughput capacity following the completion of its debottlenecking project in January 2023. The Tengiz and Korolev fields, operated under TCO, saw mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP) in 2023, with full production expected to ramp up in early 2025. This expansion aligns with CPC's role in transporting an average of 1.4 million barrels of crude oil per day, including Chevron\u2019s production, and its capacity increase to accommodate FGP's start-up. Chevron holds a 15% interest in CPC, reinforcing its strategic dependency on the pipeline for export logistics.",

        "Hop 1: [CVX](page_113) \u2192 [Crude Oil]: Chevron's 2023 reserves data shows growth in Kazakhstan, particularly in fields like Tengiz and Korolev, with proved reserves recognized for new projects.",
        "Hop 2: [Crude Oil] \u2192 [CPC]: Chevron's crude oil production from Tengiz and Korolev is primarily exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which completed a debottlenecking project in January 2023 to increase throughput capacity.",
        "Hop 3: [CPC] \u2190 [CVX](page_16): Chevron has a 15% interest in CPC and relies on the pipeline to transport 1.2 million barrels per day of Kazakh crude, which includes Chevron\u2019s share of TCO production."

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' financial exposure through guarantees to APLNG relate to its strategic focus on CBM production in Queensland, particularly given the $5.0 billion carrying value of its APLNG investment?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips has significant financial exposure to APLNG through multiple guarantees totaling up to $1.3 billion in maximum potential liabilities, including $210 million tied to a project finance reserve account withdrawal and $610 million (or $1.0 billion in case of intentional breach) linked to natural gas delivery obligations. These guarantees reflect the company's ongoing financial commitment to APLNG despite its non-recourse project financing structure. This exposure is directly tied to APLNG's core activity of producing coal bed methane (CBM) from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, which is central to COP's strategy of maintaining a strong LNG position through long-term sales agreements and additional LNG cargo sales to Asia Pacific markets. The $5.0 billion carrying value of COP's APLNG investment at year-end underscores the strategic importance of this CBM production platform in Australia, despite the contingent liabilities associated with it.",

          "chunk_text": "At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

      "question": "Given ExxonMobil's long-standing operational presence in Nigeria since at least 2006, how does the company's exposure to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) in Nigeria\u2014where the exploration period is typically 10 years and production period is 20 years\u2014impact the classification and economic interest in proved reserves under SEC reporting requirements?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil has operated in Nigeria since at least 2006, where its activities are governed by production-sharing contracts (PSCs) that typically include a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period, which may be extended. Under SEC reporting rules, proved reserves must be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible prior to the expiration of contracts unless renewal is reasonably certain. Since Nigeria\u2019s PSCs include defined expiration dates and partial relinquishment provisions under the Petroleum Industry Act, ExxonMobil must assess the likelihood of contract extensions when reporting proved reserves. As of year-end 2021, 12% of ExxonMobil\u2019s total proved reserves on an oil-equivalent basis were associated with PSC arrangements, and reserves under these contracts vary inversely with price changes. Therefore, the finite duration and fiscal terms of Nigeria\u2019s PSCs directly influence the economic interest and classification of reserves under SEC rules, particularly for deepwater offshore assets.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% stake in APLNG, a joint venture focused on producing coal bed methane (CBM) and exporting LNG from Queensland, Australia. This decision was made despite the need to write down the carrying value of its existing APLNG investment to $5,574 million due to a fair value assessment that was below the previous carrying value, resulting in a $688 million before-tax charge. APLNG operates under long-term sales agreements and has a $4.7 billion outstanding project finance facility as of December 31, 2023, which indicates the scale and long-term commitment of the venture. By increasing its stake, ConocoPhillips is reinforcing its strategic position in Queensland\u2019s CBM and LNG markets, despite the short-term financial impact of the write-down, suggesting confidence in the long-term value and operational performance of APLNG.",

      "question": "How does Chevron's reliance on cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits impact the strategic value of Renewable Energy Group, Inc., especially considering the $352 million in downstream goodwill attributed to its acquisition?",
      "answer": "Chevron's ability to achieve its lower carbon ambitions is partially dependent on the availability and affordability of verifiable carbon credits, which are essential for compliance with evolving climate policies and for supporting its lower carbon business lines. Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG) plays a central role in this strategy, as it produces most of Chevron's renewable fuels and generates a significant portion of the company's carbon credit activities. The $352 million in downstream goodwill on Chevron's balance sheet, directly tied to the REG acquisition, underscores the strategic importance of this entity in enabling Chevron's participation in the carbon credit market and broader energy transition. However, the effectiveness of this investment is contingent on REG's ability to consistently generate verifiable carbon credits, which remain subject to regulatory, technological, and market uncertainties outlined in Chevron's risk factors. Therefore, the strategic value of REG is closely tied to the viability and scalability of carbon credit generation, which in turn affects the long-term justification for the goodwill attributed to its acquisition.",

Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG  ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG  matters, including human rights, biodiversity, waste and water, have increased, and may continue to increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment.\n\nOur ambitions and disclosures related to ESG matters subject us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our reputation and stock price or result in other material adverse impacts to the company Chevron has set a number of lower carbon-related ambitions, which may include aspirations, targets, guidance, objectives, metrics, and/or goals. In particular, Chevron has announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in upstream by 2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for upstream carbon intensity and portfolio carbon intensity. Chevron regularly evaluates its ambitions and expects to change or eliminate some of these aspirations, targets, and other ambitions for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors.\n\nOur ability to achieve any ambition, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, including those outlined in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 35 through 37, and any new businesses, is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron's control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) laws, governmental regulation, policies, and other enabling actions, including  those  regarding  subsidies,  tax   and  other  incentives  as  well  as  the  granting  of  necessary  permits  by  governing  authorities;  (3)  the  availability  and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC's Global Warming Potentials and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program,  affecting  ESG   standards  or  disclosures;  (6)  evolving  standards  for  tracking  and  reporting  on  emissions  and  emission  reductions  and  removals;  (7) customers' and consumers' preferences and use of the company's products or substitute products; (8) actions taken by the company's competitors in response to legislation and regulations; and (9) successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions with customers, suppliers, partners, and governments.\n\nThe standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, disclosing, marketing and advertising related to ESG  matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Further, our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time. Either of these circumstances may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period.\n\nOur existing processes and controls may not align with evolving voluntary and mandatory standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG  metrics. Our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, including through non-public processes, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. For example, Chevron's methane intensity target is calculated based on Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2021), which requires use of local regulatory reporting methodologies where applicable. The U.S. EPA has adopted notable changes to reporting methodologies in its G reenhouse G as Reporting Program (40 C.F.R. Part 98.230), which are applicable to Chevron's U.S. operations. We expect these adopted changes may increase our reported emissions in future years, and therefore, increase  our  reported  methane  intensity.  In  addition,  Chevron  participates,  along  with  other  companies,  institutes,  universities,  trade  associations  and  other organizations, in various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects that express various ambitions, aspirations and goals related to climate change, emissions and energy transition. Chevron's individual ambitions, future performance or policies may differ from the ambitions of such organizations or the individual ambitions of other participants in these various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects, and Chevron may unilaterally change its individual ambitions. Achievement of or efforts to achieve ambitions such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives has, and may continue to, increase costs, and, in addition, may require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the company's business plans, operations and financial results, potentially resulting in reduction to the economic endof-life of certain assets, impairing the associated net book value, among other material adverse impacts.

Requirements  for  these  and  other  similar  policies  and  programs  are  complex ,  ever  changing,  program  specific  and  encompass:  (1)  the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels; (2) the purchasing, selling, utilizing and retiring of allowances and carbon credits; and (3) other emissions reduction measures including efficiency improvements and capturing GHG  emissions. These compliance policies and programs have had and may continue to have negative impacts on the company now and in the future including, but not limited to, the displacement of hydrocarbon and other products and/or the impairment of assets. These policies have also enabled opportunities for Chevron in its lower carbon business lines. For example, Renewable Energy G roup, Inc. (REG ) produces most of  Chevron's renewable fuels offering and generates a substantial amount of the company's carbon credit generation activities. Although we expect the company's costs to comply with these policies and programs to continue to increase, these costs currently do not have a material impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations.\n\nSignificant uncertainty remains as to the pace and extent to which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is  difficult  to  predict  with  certainty  and is ex pected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company's activities and market conditions. As discussed below, in 2021, the company announced planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come.\n\nChevron supports the Paris Agreement's global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of  its  operations  while  continuing  to  meet  the  demand  for  energy.  Chevron  believes  that  broad,  market-based  mechanisms  are  the  most  efficient  approach  to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company's longrange supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards and demand response to oil and natural gas prices.\n\nThe company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' and consumers' demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow new businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen, power generation for data centers, and emerging technologies. To grow its new businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company's capabilities, assets, partnerships and customer relationships.  The company's oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon market, economic, legislative and regulatory forces, among other factors.\n\nIn  2021,  Chevron  announced  aspirations  and  targets  that  align  with  its  strategy,  as  noted  below .  Chevron  uses  emissions  intensity  targets,  which  enable  the company to assess, quantify and transparently communicate its own carbon performance in a standardized way. Chevron regularly evaluates its aspirations, targets and goals and expects to change or eliminate some of its aspirations, targets and goals for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors.\n\nThe company's ability to achieve any aspiration, target or goal is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron's control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies  and  low-  or  non-carbon-based  energy  sources;  (2)  laws,  governmental  regulation,  policies,  and  other  enabling  actions,  including  those  regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our",

The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2024, and no impairment was required.\n\n## Note 28\n\n## Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n\nChevron's expected credit loss allowance balance was $611 and $641 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances.\n\nThe majority of the company's receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $18,338 at December 31, 2024, which reflects the company's diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company's broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk  is  lim ited.  The  company  routinely  assesses  the  financial  strength  of  its  customers.  When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is ex tended and a receivable balance exists,  the  company applies a quantitative  calculation  to  current  trade  receivable  balances  that  reflects  credit  risk  predictive  analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company's historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company's expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days.\n\nChevron's non-trade receivable balance was $3,835 at December 31, 2024, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review.  This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts.  Non-trade  receivables  also  include  employee  and  tax   receivables  that  are  deemed  immaterial  and  low  risk.  Loans  to  equity  affiliates  and  non-equity investees are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of zero and $219 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included within 'Investments and advances' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' internal processes for estimating proved reserves are subject to rigorous internal and external oversight, with DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) playing a critical role in independently reviewing over 90% of the company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2021. This review was conducted to ensure compliance with SEC regulations and involved the presentation of extensive technical data, including seismic information, reservoir simulation models, and economic criteria. D&M provided an independent opinion confirming that ConocoPhillips' processes were in line with SEC definitions. This third-party validation is further reinforced in the 10-K filing, where D&M's formal consent (Exhibit 23.2) and their full report (Exhibit 99) are explicitly listed as key exhibits, underscoring the regulatory and evidentiary importance of their involvement in the reserves estimation process.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil operates in Nigeria under 30-year production sharing contracts (PSCs), which include a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period, potentially extendable under the Petroleum Industry Act of 2021. These long-term agreements imply a significant, multi-decade financial and operational commitment to the country. However, the company faces potential tax audit exposure in Nigeria, as the country's open tax years extend back to 2006, meaning ExxonMobil could be subject to tax reassessments or adjustments for a substantial portion of its operational history in the country. This creates a risk that financial obligations or liabilities could arise from periods overlapping with ongoing or future production phases under these PSCs, thereby impacting the economic viability of those contracts and requiring careful tax contingency planning.",

The terms  and  conditions  under  which  the  Corporation  maintains  exploration  and/or  production  rights  to  the  acreage  are  propertyspecific, contractually defined, and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.\n\n## D. Summary of Acreage Terms\n\n## UNITED STATES\n\nOil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners.

Under  certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private property, a 'fee interest' is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.\n\n## CANADA / OTHER AMERICAS\n\n## Canada\n\nExploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a term  of  nine  years.  Offshore  production  licenses  are  valid  for  25  years,  with  rights  of  extension  for  continued  production. Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term.\n\n## Argentina\n\nThe  Federal  Hydrocarbon  Law  was  amended  in  2014.  Pursuant  to  the  amended  law,  the  production  term  for  an  onshore unconventional concession is 35 years, and 25 years for a conventional concession, with unlimited 10-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years, divided  into  two  exploration  periods  of  four  years,  with  an  optional  extension  of  five  years  for  each  license.  Two  onshore exploration  concessions  were  initially  granted  prior  to  the  amendment  and  are  governed  under  Provincial  Law  with  expiration terms through 2024.\n\n## Brazil\n\nThe exploration and production of oil and gas are governed by concession contracts and production sharing contracts. Concession contracts  provide  for  an  exploration  period  of  up  to  8  years  and  a  production  period  of  27  years.  Production  sharing  contracts provide for an exploration period of up to 7 years and a production period of up to 28 years.\n\n## Guyana\n\nThe  Petroleum  (Exploration  and  Production)  Act  authorizes  the  government  of  Guyana  to  grant  petroleum  prospecting  and production  licenses  and  to  enter  into  petroleum  agreements  for  the  exploration  and  production  of  hydrocarbons.  Petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years and a production period of 20 years, with a 10-year extension.\n\n## EUROPE\n\n## Germany\n\nExploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nUnder the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "question": "How does Chevron's strategic investment in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) relate to its crude oil reserves and production volumes in Kazakhstan, particularly in light of the Future Growth Project (FGP) and Karachaganak Expansion Project timelines?",
      "answer": "Chevron holds a 15% interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which transports an average of 1.4 million barrels of crude oil per day, including 1.2 million barrels from Kazakhstan. This infrastructure is critical for Chevron's upstream operations in Kazakhstan, particularly for the Tengiz and Korolev fields developed under TCO, as well as the Karachaganak field. The FGP at Tengiz is expected to start-up in the first half of 2025 and ramp up to full production within three months, while the Karachaganak Expansion Project Stage 1A and Stage 1B are expected to complete in 2024 and 2026, respectively. These developments align with Chevron's crude oil reserves and production strategy, as shown in the reserves table where Kazakhstan (TCO) reported 1,295 billion cubic feet of reserves at the end of 2023. The CPC's increased throughput capacity, achieved through the debottlenecking project in early 2023, directly supports the anticipated production increases from these projects, linking Chevron's infrastructure investment to its upstream production growth targets.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips has a $116 million maximum potential future payment exposure through guarantees to Alba Plant LLC, which processes natural gas from the Alba Unit in Equatorial Guinea and extracts condensate for sale at market prices. This financial exposure reflects a structured, indirect involvement in condensate monetization via a joint venture. In contrast, COP directly produces and exports condensate from the Aasta Hansteen Field in Norway, where it loads condensate onto shuttle tankers for transport to market. The indirect model in Equatorial Guinea involves shared risk and capital investment with partners, while the Norwegian approach provides full operational control and direct market access. This distinction highlights a strategic bifurcation in how COP monetizes condensate depending on geography and asset structure.",

          "chunk_text": "At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

Inc (CUSA), a major subsidiary, manages most of Chevron's U.S. crude oil production assets, which directly ties its operational performance to crude oil price fluctuations.

Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.

Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' impairment of its investment in APLNG relate to the company's dependency on CBM as a resource base, and what does this reveal about the valuation sensitivity of coalbed methane assets under changing market conditions?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) depends on coalbed methane (CBM) as a key resource base, particularly through its investment in the APLNG joint venture, which produces CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. In 2021, COP exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% stake in APLNG for $1.645 billion. However, due to a decline in the fair value of APLNG as observed in the market, COP recorded a noncash impairment charge of $688 million, reducing the carrying value of its investment to $5,574 million. This impairment reflects the sensitivity of CBM asset valuations to market dynamics, including commodity pricing and long-term demand assumptions. The write-down indicates that despite COP's strategic emphasis on CBM and LNG, the financial performance and valuation of these assets are highly sensitive to external pricing signals and market expectations, particularly in volatile energy markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(page_3) \u2192 CBM: COP depends on CBM as a raw material, indicating its strategic importance in the company's upstream operations.",
        "Hop 2: CBM \u2192 APLNG: APLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM and converting it into LNG for export, linking the raw material to a key investment vehicle.",
        "Hop 3: APLNG \u2190 COP(page_119): COP's $688 million impairment of its APLNG investment highlights a significant valuation adjustment tied to the underlying CBM resource base under changing market conditions."

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' strategic emphasis on coalbed methane (CBM) through its stake in APLNG reconcile with the $688 million before-tax charge recorded in 2021, which reflected a market participant view of APLNG's fair value being below the carrying value of the investment?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips highlights APLNG as a strategic joint venture that provides access to CBM resources in Australia and strengthens its LNG position, particularly targeting Asian markets. However, in 2021, when Origin Energy sought to sell a 10% stake in APLNG, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right and purchased the stake. The fair value of APLNG from this transaction was determined to be lower than the carrying value of COP\u2019s existing investment, resulting in a $688 million before-tax impairment charge. This discrepancy suggests that while APLNG remains strategically important for CBM and LNG exposure, the market valuation at the time indicated a lower financial worth than previously recorded, prompting a write-down. The contrast between the qualitative strategic positioning of CBM through APLNG and the quantitative impairment charge reflects a tension between long-term resource access and short-term asset valuation pressures.",

        "Hop 1: COP(page_3) \u2192 CBM: CBM is identified as a key resource type in the company's operations, specifically in the context of industry terminology and energy production.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips utilizes DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) to independently review over 85% of its proved reserves estimation processes, ensuring compliance with SEC regulations and internal policy. This third-party review is a key part of the company\u2019s internal control framework for reserves reporting. The results of D&M's evaluation are formally documented in a report that is included as Exhibit 99 in the 10-K filing, demonstrating transparency and external validation of the company\u2019s reserves estimation methodology. This linkage shows how ConocoPhillips integrates external expert analysis into its regulatory disclosures to reinforce the credibility of its reserves reporting.",

      "answer": "Chevron's $352 goodwill investment in Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG) in the downstream segment reflects its strategic commitment to lower carbon business lines. REG is a key contributor to Chevron's carbon credit generation, which is essential for meeting its climate-related ambitions, including Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets. However, Chevron highlights in its risk factors that achieving these goals is contingent on the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits \u2014 a factor that could significantly influence the long-term value of the REG acquisition. This interplay shows how Chevron's downstream goodwill investment is tied to broader ESG and operational risks related to carbon credit markets.",

The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2024, and no impairment was required.\n\n## Note 28\n\n## Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n\nChevron's expected credit loss allowance balance was $611 and $641 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances.\n\nThe majority of the company's receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $18,338 at December 31, 2024, which reflects the company's diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company's broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk  is  lim ited.  The  company  routinely  assesses  the  financial  strength  of  its  customers.  When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is ex tended and a receivable balance exists,  the  company applies a quantitative  calculation  to  current  trade  receivable  balances  that  reflects  credit  risk  predictive  analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company's historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company's expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days.\n\nChevron's non-trade receivable balance was $3,835 at December 31, 2024, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review.  This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts.  Non-trade  receivables  also  include  employee  and  tax   receivables  that  are  deemed  immaterial  and  low  risk.  Loans  to  equity  affiliates  and  non-equity investees are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of zero and $219 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included within 'Investments and advances' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

Requirements  for  these  and  other  similar  policies  and  programs  are  complex ,  ever  changing,  program  specific  and  encompass:  (1)  the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels; (2) the purchasing, selling, utilizing and retiring of allowances and carbon credits; and (3) other emissions reduction measures including efficiency improvements and capturing GHG  emissions. These compliance policies and programs have had and may continue to have negative impacts on the company now and in the future including, but not limited to, the displacement of hydrocarbon and other products and/or the impairment of assets. These policies have also enabled opportunities for Chevron in its lower carbon business lines. For example, Renewable Energy G roup, Inc. (REG ) produces most of  Chevron's renewable fuels offering and generates a substantial amount of the company's carbon credit generation activities. Although we expect the company's costs to comply with these policies and programs to continue to increase, these costs currently do not have a material impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations.\n\nSignificant uncertainty remains as to the pace and extent to which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is  difficult  to  predict  with  certainty  and is ex pected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company's activities and market conditions. As discussed below, in 2021, the company announced planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come.\n\nChevron supports the Paris Agreement's global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of  its  operations  while  continuing  to  meet  the  demand  for  energy.  Chevron  believes  that  broad,  market-based  mechanisms  are  the  most  efficient  approach  to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company's longrange supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards and demand response to oil and natural gas prices.\n\nThe company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' and consumers' demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow new businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen, power generation for data centers, and emerging technologies. To grow its new businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company's capabilities, assets, partnerships and customer relationships.  The company's oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon market, economic, legislative and regulatory forces, among other factors.\n\nIn  2021,  Chevron  announced  aspirations  and  targets  that  align  with  its  strategy,  as  noted  below .  Chevron  uses  emissions  intensity  targets,  which  enable  the company to assess, quantify and transparently communicate its own carbon performance in a standardized way. Chevron regularly evaluates its aspirations, targets and goals and expects to change or eliminate some of its aspirations, targets and goals for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors.\n\nThe company's ability to achieve any aspiration, target or goal is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron's control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies  and  low-  or  non-carbon-based  energy  sources;  (2)  laws,  governmental  regulation,  policies,  and  other  enabling  actions,  including  those  regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our",

Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG  ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG  matters, including human rights, biodiversity, waste and water, have increased, and may continue to increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment.\n\nOur ambitions and disclosures related to ESG matters subject us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our reputation and stock price or result in other material adverse impacts to the company Chevron has set a number of lower carbon-related ambitions, which may include aspirations, targets, guidance, objectives, metrics, and/or goals. In particular, Chevron has announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in upstream by 2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for upstream carbon intensity and portfolio carbon intensity. Chevron regularly evaluates its ambitions and expects to change or eliminate some of these aspirations, targets, and other ambitions for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors.\n\nOur ability to achieve any ambition, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, including those outlined in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 35 through 37, and any new businesses, is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron's control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) laws, governmental regulation, policies, and other enabling actions, including  those  regarding  subsidies,  tax   and  other  incentives  as  well  as  the  granting  of  necessary  permits  by  governing  authorities;  (3)  the  availability  and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC's Global Warming Potentials and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program,  affecting  ESG   standards  or  disclosures;  (6)  evolving  standards  for  tracking  and  reporting  on  emissions  and  emission  reductions  and  removals;  (7) customers' and consumers' preferences and use of the company's products or substitute products; (8) actions taken by the company's competitors in response to legislation and regulations; and (9) successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions with customers, suppliers, partners, and governments.\n\nThe standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, disclosing, marketing and advertising related to ESG  matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Further, our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time. Either of these circumstances may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period.\n\nOur existing processes and controls may not align with evolving voluntary and mandatory standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG  metrics. Our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, including through non-public processes, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. For example, Chevron's methane intensity target is calculated based on Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2021), which requires use of local regulatory reporting methodologies where applicable. The U.S. EPA has adopted notable changes to reporting methodologies in its G reenhouse G as Reporting Program (40 C.F.R. Part 98.230), which are applicable to Chevron's U.S. operations. We expect these adopted changes may increase our reported emissions in future years, and therefore, increase  our  reported  methane  intensity.  In  addition,  Chevron  participates,  along  with  other  companies,  institutes,  universities,  trade  associations  and  other organizations, in various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects that express various ambitions, aspirations and goals related to climate change, emissions and energy transition. Chevron's individual ambitions, future performance or policies may differ from the ambitions of such organizations or the individual ambitions of other participants in these various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects, and Chevron may unilaterally change its individual ambitions. Achievement of or efforts to achieve ambitions such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives has, and may continue to, increase costs, and, in addition, may require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the company's business plans, operations and financial results, potentially resulting in reduction to the economic endof-life of certain assets, impairing the associated net book value, among other material adverse impacts.

      "answer": "Chevron faces significant legal uncertainty in Louisiana due to coastal erosion lawsuits involving 39 cases where the company is a defendant, with one trial set for October 2024 and no ability to estimate potential liability. At the same time, Chevron is expanding its renewable fuels footprint in the state through its operations in Geismar, where production capacity is increasing from 7,000 to 22,000 barrels per day, set for completion in 2024. This expansion is supported by its joint venture, Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC, which produces soybean oil in Destrehan, Louisiana\u2014used as a renewable feedstock for fuels like renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

      "question": "How does Chevron's 2023 reserve revision decrease of 107 million BOE at TCO in Kazakhstan reconcile with the significant capital expenditures of $2.5 billion in Asia, primarily for TCO's development projects?",
      "answer": "Chevron reported a reserve revision decrease of 107 million BOE at TCO in Kazakhstan due to performance-driven reservoir model changes (page 108). Despite this reduction, the company invested approximately $2.5 billion in Asia, primarily for TCO's development projects (page 109). This apparent contradiction is explained by TCO's ongoing major development initiatives, such as the Future Growth Project (FGP) and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP), which are expected to ramp up production starting in 2025 (page 16). These projects have already led to the recognition of proved reserves, suggesting that Chevron's continued investment is aimed at future reserve growth and production capacity, even in the face of short-term reserve revisions.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips produces condensate from the Aasta Hansteen Field in the Norwegian Sea, which is transported via shuttle tankers to market. In Equatorial Guinea, the company operates the Alba Unit, where Alba Plant LLC extracts condensate and LPG from natural gas under a long-term contract, with COP's share of revenue reported in 'Equity in earnings of affiliates.' Additionally, COP has guaranteed payment obligations tied to Alba Plant LLC with a maximum potential future payment of $116 million. This creates a dual exposure: COP earns equity income from condensate sales through Alba Plant LLC, while also facing financial liability risk from guarantees tied to the same entity. The condensate produced in Norway is directly sold to market, whereas in Equatorial Guinea, condensate extraction is part of a broader joint venture structure with associated contingent liabilities, highlighting differing risk-return profiles across similar operational activities.",

Crude oil is exported to our operated terminal located at Teesside, U.K., and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. In 2024, the Eldfisk North development, a subsea tieback to Eldfisk, achieved first production.\n\n## Heidrun Field\n\nThe Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is stored in a floating storage unit and exported via shuttle tankers. Most of the gas is transported to Europe via gas processing terminals in Norway with some reinjected for pressure support if required. A portion of the gas is also transported for use as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we have an 18 percent interest.\n\n## Aasta Hansteen Field\n\nThe Aasta Hansteen Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Gas is transported through the Polarled gas pipeline to the onshore Nyhamna processing plant for fi nal processing prior to export to market. Produced condensate is loaded onto shuttle tankers and transported to market.",

With the acquisition, we have increased our global operations adding oil, natural gas and LNG activity in Equatorial Guinea to our portfolio. See Note 3.\n\nWe have varying stages of oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in Equatorial Guinea. We operate in both the Alba and Block D PSCs that form the Alba Unit located offshore Equatorial Guinea.\n\n## Gas Processing\n\nThe following facilities located on Bioko Island allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba Unit and are accounted for as equity method i nvestments and are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.\n\nWe own a 52.2 percent interest in the Alba Plant LLC, our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (27.8 percent) and Sociedad Nacional de Gas de Guinea Ecuatorial (SONAGAS) (20.0 percent), which operates an onshore liquified petroleum gas (LPG) processing plant. Alba Plant LLC processes Alba Unit natural gas under a fixed-rate long-term contract. The LPG processing plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and sells it at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement. Processed natural gas is delivered to Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (EG LNG) for liquefaction and storage. We market our share of LNG to third parties indexed at global LNG prices.\n\nWe own a 56.0 percent interest in EG LNG, our joint venture with SONAGAS (37.9 percent) and Marubeni Gas Development UK Limited (6.1 percent), which operates a 3.7 MTPA LNG production facility. In January 2024, we began a five-year LNG sales agreement for a portion of our equity gas from the Alba Unit, providing us with additional exposure to the European LNG market.\n\nWe own a 45.0 percent interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (AMPCO), our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (45.0 percent) and SONAGAS (10.0 percent), which operates a methanol plant. The plant is currently offline.\n\nAdditionally, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen Field under a combination of tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangements which are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.",

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips utilizes DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, as part of its internal control process to validate the adequacy and effectiveness of its reserves estimation processes. During 2024, D&M reviewed over 85% of the company's proved reserves, assessing whether these processes align with SEC regulations. The company presented detailed technical and economic data to D&M, including seismic information, reservoir simulation models, and production tests, to support its reserves estimation methods. D&M concluded that the processes used by ConocoPhillips were in accordance with SEC reserves definitions. This external validation is further substantiated by the inclusion of D&M's report as Exhibit 99 in the 10-K filing, indicating the company's commitment to transparency and external verification of its reserves reporting. This dual approach\u2014leveraging D&M as part of internal controls and publicly disclosing their findings\u2014demonstrates a robust framework for ensuring the reliability and regulatory compliance of reserves estimates.",

      "question": "How does Chevron's production and reserve data for crude oil in 2023 relate to its stake in TCO, particularly in light of TCO's development projects and production export infrastructure?",
      "answer": "Chevron's crude oil production and reserves data in 2023, particularly in Asia (8,393 BCF of reserves and 9,395 million barrels of crude oil), are closely tied to its stake in TCO, which operates major crude oil fields in Kazakhstan, including Tengiz and Korolev. TCO's 2023 production was largely exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which Chevron has a 15% interest in. TCO's Future Growth Project (FGP) and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP), expected to ramp up production starting in 2025, align with Chevron\u2019s long-term reserve additions and production outlook. Chevron\u2019s consolidated crude oil reserves in Asia, including TCO\u2019s 78 million barrels at year-end 2023, reflect the importance of TCO\u2019s operations to Chevron\u2019s upstream portfolio. This interplay highlights how Chevron\u2019s crude oil production outlook is directly influenced by TCO\u2019s development projects and export infrastructure capabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CVX](page_113) \u2192 [Crude Oil]: Chevron reports detailed crude oil reserves and production data across global regions, including Asia, where it had 8,393 BCF of reserves and 9,395 million barrels of crude oil at year-end 2023.",
        "Hop 2: [Crude Oil] \u2192 [TCO]: TCO, in which Chevron holds a stake, operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan and exports most of its 2023 crude oil production via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), where Chevron has a 15% interest.",
        "Hop 3: [TCO] \u2190 [CVX](page_112): Chevron\u2019s consolidated crude oil reserves include TCO\u2019s contribution, which stood at 78 million barrels at the end of 2023, indicating the materiality of TCO\u2019s operations to Chevron\u2019s overall upstream portfolio."

      "answer": "ExxonMobil\u2019s acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which brings over 2.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved reserves and 700 thousand barrels per day of production capacity, appears strategically aimed at bolstering upstream production. However, in 2023, ExxonMobil reported flat total production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, with Permian and Guyana growth offset by divestments and curtailments. This suggests that while Pioneer\u2019s assets could drive future production growth, the immediate impact in 2023 was not yet realized due to the transaction\u2019s pending regulatory approval and expected 2024 close date. The acquisition aligns with a longer-term production growth strategy, but in 2023, ExxonMobil\u2019s output remained constrained by external factors.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' decision to increase its APLNG stake while recording a significant impairment indicates a strategic long-term view of APLNG's value despite short-term valuation declines. The $688 million impairment reflects a market participant assessment of APLNG's fair value being below carrying value, yet the company still exercised its preemption right to acquire additional equity. This contrasts with South Sumatra, where ConocoPhillips holds a 54% interest and reports specific production volumes (51 MBOED), indicating a more operationally controlled and stable investment. The juxtaposition suggests that while the company recognizes short-term impairments in certain equity investments, it remains committed to long-term strategic positions, particularly in LNG and resource-rich regions, even when direct operational control is limited.",

The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.

Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.

      "answer": "COP's 30% stake in QatarEnergy LNG, which contributed 13 thousand barrels per day (MBD) of crude oil production in 2023, represents a material component of its upstream production portfolio. This asset-specific production ties directly into COP's broader dependence on crude oil, a risk factor emphasized on page 145, where the company warns of financial exposure due to market volatility in hydrocarbon prices. The quantitative production figure from QatarEnergy LNG underscores the operational scale of COP's crude oil involvement, reinforcing the qualitative risk that fluctuations in crude oil prices could materially affect earnings and cash flow. Therefore, the stake not only contributes to output metrics but also amplifies COP\u2019s systemic exposure to commodity price cycles.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' impairment of its APLNG investment in 2021 reflect on the long-term viability of APLNG's $5.7 billion nonrecourse financing structure, especially considering Origin Energy's dual role as both a joint venture partner and operator of APLNG's production system?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips recorded a $688 million pre-tax impairment on its APLNG investment in 2021 due to a decline in fair value below carrying value, as evidenced by Origin Energy's sale of a 10% stake for $1.645 billion. This impairment suggests ConocoPhillips viewed APLNG's long-term prospects as less favorable than previously anticipated, despite APLNG having a substantial $5.7 billion in outstanding nonrecourse financing at year-end. APLNG's financing structure, composed of U.S. Ex-Im Bank loans, commercial bank facilities, and private placement notes, was scheduled for bi-annual repayments through 2030, making the long-term viability of this structure highly dependent on sustained LNG demand and pricing. Origin Energy's role as operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while ConocoPhillips operates the LNG facility, introduces operational interdependence that could affect cash flow predictability. The impairment decision indicates ConocoPhillips factored in risks related to both market conditions and the complex operational structure when assessing APLNG's future cash flows, raising questions about whether the financing obligations can be met under the revised fair value assumptions.",

Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.

Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.

      "question": "How has Chevron accounted for the Hess acquisition in its financial reporting, given the FTC approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the unresolved Stabroek Block arbitration that could block the transaction?",
      "answer": "Chevron has not disclosed pro forma financial information for the Hess acquisition, as it was deemed not to have a material impact on Chevron's results of operations. Despite the FTC's approval of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act through a consent agreement finalized on September 30, 2024, the acquisition remains subject to the outcome of an arbitration proceeding related to the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement. The arbitration merits hearing is scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected within three months thereafter. An adverse ruling could prevent the transaction from closing, introducing uncertainty that likely supports the decision not to present pro forma financials. This approach reflects the contingent nature of the acquisition's completion and its potential non-materiality only if the transaction does not proceed or remains unresolved beyond the current reporting period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CVX](page_24) \u2192 [Hart-Scott-Rodino Act]: Chevron must comply with this act as part of the regulatory approval process for the Hess acquisition; the FTC's clearance was achieved via a consent agreement.",
        "Hop 2: [Hart-Scott-Rodino Act] \u2192 [Hess Corporation]: The consent agreement with the FTC allows Chevron to proceed toward closing the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, but the transaction remains subject to arbitration proceedings involving Hess' Guyana assets.",
        "Hop 3: [Hess Corporation] \u2190 [CVX](page_35): Note 30 on page 35 confirms the Hess acquisition agreement and states that no pro forma financial information was disclosed because the acquisition was not considered to have a material impact on Chevron's results of operations."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\nChevron and Hess, resolving the concerns the FTC identified during its review of the transaction. Chevron and Hess have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to maintain our ability under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended, to close the merger following satisfactory resolution of the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement. Additionally, if any G uyanese governmental body, agency or authority of competent jurisdiction asserts that its approval is required as a result of the consequences of the merger in G uyana on Hess' assets in G uyana (which has not occurred as of the filing date of this report), approval of such governmental body, agency or authority will become a condition to each party's obligation to complete the merger.\n\nThe failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. A failure to complete the acquisition would mean that we will not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the acquisition that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the company's business after the transaction or materially delay the completion of the acquisition. A delay in completing the acquisition could cause the company to realize some or all of the benefits later than we otherwise ex pect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the acquisition.\n\nAcquisitions may cause Chevron's financial results to differ from the company's expectations or the expectations of the investment community, the company may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and the acquisition may disrupt the company's current plans or operations The success of the pending acquisition of Hess will depend, in part, on Chevron's ability to successfully integrate the business of Hess and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies. Difficulties in integrating Hess may result in the failure to realize anticipated synergies in the ex pected timeframes, in operational challenges, and in the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns, as well as in unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition, which may have an adverse impact on the company's financial results.\n\n## LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS\n\nChevron's business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials,  and  it  purchases,  handles  and  disposes  of  other  potentially  hazardous  materials  in  the  course  of  its  business.  Chevron's  operations  also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action. For example,  liability  or  delays  could  result  from  an  accidental,  unlawful  discharge  or  from  new  conclusions  about  the  effects  of  the  company's  current  or  former operations or products on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company's causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\n\nFor information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 16 Litigation.\n\nPolitical instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron's business The company's operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing political, regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company's partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes, tariffs, royalties, fees, penalties or other costs. In a number of locations, including the European Union, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company's operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company's competitiveness, return on investments, or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company's continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company's operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company's operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate, such as sanctions imposed in V enezuela and Russia, which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations and financial results in these countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those",

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, a majority of Hess stockholders voted to approve the merger. Following the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) review of the transaction, on September 30, 2024, the FTC announced that a majority of the Commission voted to accept a consent agreement among the FTC, Chevron and Hess, resolving the concerns the FTC identified during its review of the transaction. Chevron and Hess have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to maintain our ability to close the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended. The filing of an arbitration relating to the right of first refusal contained in the Stabroek Block operating agreement among Hess Guyana Exploration Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hess, and affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation has delayed completion of the transaction. An arbitration decision against Hess G uyana and in favor of Exxon G uyana and CNOOC G uyana would cause the transaction not to be completed. The arbitration merits hearing has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in approximately the following three months.\n\nChevron and  Hess  are  working  to  complete  the  merger  as  soon  as  practicable.  However,  neither  Chevron  nor  Hess  can  predict  the  actual  date  on  which  the transaction will be completed, if at all, because it is subject to conditions beyond each company's control.

      "question": "Given ExxonMobil's projection that oil will maintain close to a 30% share of the global energy mix through 2050, how does their operational treatment of natural gas as an oil-equivalent resource reflect their strategic positioning in a transitioning energy landscape?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's long-term projection highlights oil maintaining a dominant 30% share in the global energy mix through 2050, despite anticipated growth in renewables and lower-carbon technologies. This strategic outlook is reinforced by their operational framework, which treats natural gas as an oil-equivalent resource using a conversion rate of six billion cubic feet per one million barrels. This equivalence suggests that ExxonMobil is not only banking on continued demand for hydrocarbon-based energy but is also structurally aligning its resource reporting and potentially its capital allocation to reflect a broader, oil-linked energy portfolio. This dual approach underscores a strategy that integrates oil's projected longevity with natural gas as a complementary, interchangeable resource in a gradually decarbonizing market.",
